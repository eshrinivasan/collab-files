and if we look at the specs on this guy you can see that it has a quantum dot technology lcd screen with an eye
for uh processing speed an octa-core cpu with 32 gigabytes of rom 1920 by 1200 full hd display front five megapixel camera rear eight megapixel camera with autofocus
there's that five thousand milliamp hour battery and it actually comes with two point four and five gigahertz wi-fi built in battery or excuse me
you know good for kids good for families 10 inch screen so it's a nice size to look at and to read with
you can see that the color on this thing is very very good and the viewing angles are also very very good
so if you're familiar with android tablets this is going to be a very similar experience to everything else that you've seen on the market
it doesn't really have any lag you can see if we go on to youtube and we scroll around you can see how fast things are to load
got two stereo speakers on the bottom so a nice feature to have there it also comes with a slot here for micro sd as well as sim cards
it is just a micro sd slot on there for storage and if we go back and minimize the video we can then run another
because it's got a you know it has kind of a 3d model here that you can look at and rotate and um once that loads
so it says spin to explore so we can kind of click on this and then spin it and then see what it's like
we'll kind of give this a little turn here so a little bit of lag there loading this is running google chrome
you can kind of see that little bit of delay if we go to view the interior and click on that link
just say skip kind of see how this feels zoom out pan around there you go and so all in all this is a really good tablet
even though there's a timer set um so it's you know it is a it's not meant to be a full featured android tablet
i'm going to continue drawing and finish this and let's see i'm going to talk to you guys soon so uh and here
so it's very nice so yeah you can buy this on the links i will put the links in the description
and morty anime right now in a patreon if you want to check it out you just go to my patreon and see what i'm doing right now
let's get to the display while the first generation of the Galaxy Tab A Series had aspect ratio of four by three samsung
IPS display here with an HD resolution of 1280 by 800 which is very nice because last year Samsung decided to use where we low res displays
actually is specially if you turn on the auto mode then you can really use it outdoors but obviously in direct sunlight
obviously this one has Wi-Fi there's Bluetooth and GPS there's also an LTE version in some markets but NFC or a fingerprint reader
you can open website beside and that runs pretty good on here in my bed we test the Galaxy Tab 7.0
got nine point five hours just over nine point five hours nine hours 45 minutes and for a device for this price
Wi-Fi is activated audio is completely turned off and there are no apps like Facebook pre-installed or installs that would constantly send notifications
if you're gonna have a lot of content like movies and books and apps and photos it is be recommended to buy it
say you can share the content in between we should it really helped me because I can just download something like our and my three daughters
they have a lot of apps that they have download and I have downward I do recommend to that control over what they are learning out there
they're not very good so it is very important to get really good content for them so really enjoy like my kids time with them
you know like we have like photo games and where you can take a picture and we can edit it and have an album for them
hey um did you know there was a virus going on shocking i know and we all have different coping mechanisms for me
i've had the chance to test this thing out for a few weeks now and though i don't personally draw a whole lot myself
my girlfriend found some great use for it drawing some delightful stuff like rule 63 artwork of me and sonic like i said we're all coping in different ways
this got really frustrating after a while because although you could technically use it to let your creativity roam on there
it was only to the extent of hoping it would show up on screen and not 10 inches off with no pressure sensitivity and lagging like constantly
even though we drew the artwork like the day we came out of the theater for sonic when we wrote them an email complaining about the dysfunctional input
they sent us this whole guide on how to fix it and that did end up working in our case so well
you need to set it up and you can plug it into any hdmi port on your pc provided your computer can handle it
there are 10 buttons in total along with the ones on your pen which i also found to have a real nice grip to it though
well i can't promise you won't run into any similar issues to the ones i had when setting up the tablet in the first place
i'd say if you already had experience with a tablet without monitor and wanted something more convenient or are a beginner looking for a cheaper starting point
what's perhaps the most interesting thing about the Dell Venue 8 38 40 is that yes it's running Google's Android 4.4
KitKat OS but it's also powered by an Intel dual core atom z3580 processor that clocks up to 2.1 gigahertz with integrated graphics which is actually power
that's a healthy assortment of the latest features and connectivity so how does Dells Intel powered venue 838 40 Android slate stack up in its weight class
Dell Venue 8 cradle offers a nice place to store your tablet but it's also powered and without any physical connectors at all when you place
however in the graphics performance module Intel's Merrifield based atom z34 80 processor with its power VR 6400 graphics engine leaves the Nexus 7 with Qualcomm Snapdragon
this is a turning of the tables for sure for Intel versus its ARM based competition not to mention starting at 179
MSRP we think the Dell Venue 8 38 40 is an easy hot Hardware editor's choice for its overall value for the dollar
and i'm trying a new angle and i just want to say a very big thank you to all the viewers
and i hope you're all well and staying safe and let's get straight on with a quick report on the vanco matrix pad zed 10 tablet
you know protector on the front which you peel off and a quite thick little book here but of course you
you can't put a sim card in this model it's wi-fi only now these sockets here one of the what that one is for your memory card
you can expand the memory and that is a micro hdmi socket and that is something that some of you people are quite interested in having i believe so
it's only got a quad core mediatek mt8163 and it's a fairly old chip i believe and it's clocked at 1.5 gigahertz so a quad core 1.5 gigahertz
excellent of wifi on this eight out of ten now the camera well on paper it looks good for a budget tablet 13 megapixel rear 5 megapixel front
it's set on video quality 1920 by 1080 and when you go in there's no other option so you you can't you know it's it's pretty
there's a lack of adjustments on the settings but you know what it's one of the better cameras i've seen you know in a in a budget tablet
i have to say i'll just you know we'll see what we've what we can do there but yeah you know it's okay it's okay
but i do find you know the the good 1920 resolution screen drains it a little bit quick and it's the brightness as well
um this tablet is a little bit long in the tooth now but it's still on sale and uh it only comes with android 9 pie
this doesn't seem to be wanting to update itself at all to android 10 let alone 11 and the security patch is from july 2019
hello and welcome to Unmatched Value so today what I have for you is what in my opinion is the best budget drawing tablet
um they're saying that this really helped them step up to the next level and I can understand that because this thing has amazing specs for a $30 tablet
it's it's really good so let's take a look at what's inside here and then we'll talk about what makes this such a great tablet to use
it doesn't have the battery inside so honestly if you're looking for yourself and the pen you select has a battery
I kiss me but it's pretty comfortably I'd say and it's got a lot of stretch to it so if you have bigger hands
there was a similar one that also had very good specs but it did not have any keys so I went with this one
most of the other ones in this price point are around 4096 pressure levels another important thing is the report rate
I mean really good then there is LPI lines per inch and it's basically a sensor going down the tablet across and down about the Pens position
I don't think it would be a problem all right so I'm going to include a video right now of me using this
so here's that alright so once again not much of an artist here but we will show you how the pen reacts
we go okay so drawing a thin line and now we're gonna try to draw a thin to thick so um yeah so very good control
if this was an artist handling this they'd probably make it look much better and much more even but it responds very well
I mean I I can recommend this based on my opinion and based on my research this is a very good choice
we're gonna have a look at a tablet a panic display and that's the XP pan artists 15.6 pro pan display and
and it doesn't mean that a higher price point or a a more known brand is a better tablet necessarily and that's why
we're gonna have a look at this if this XP pen or this 15.6 pro tablet can actually get the work done
let's start by opening up the box and see what's inside the first impression when I took the tablet out was how thin it is
an external power source worth mentioning is that this specific model is a limited holiday model that comes with some additional gifts and graphics inside the box which
it has a glossy screen protection film that we're going to remove before we start sketching underneath the tablet we have the stand for the display
so it doesn't really bother me on the side of the tablet you have 8 configurable buttons that you program in the XP Pen dashboard
Apple is a little bit special as we know so you'll need an HDMI to mini DisplayPort adapter to connect it to the iMac
it's time to get into the sketching part and have some fun with this tablet but before we do that we have to remove the plastic cover of course
I'm used to if you've seen my previous reviews you know that I don't use any of the hotkeys or scroll wheel on the side here instead
if you're sketching from a tilted viewpoint now let's talk about what the heck we're doing to this beautiful 4 5 8 here
Ferraris in recent time in my opinion and I thought it would be fun to see what it would look like any front engine layout
it will also give me the chance to see how the artist 15.6 pro performs in a real life working situation it took about 5 seconds in before
Albert or a regular tablet you might want to explore other companies than what we always hear about so not the name-brand companies but some smaller companies
I've had nothing but a great experience with XP pen and I encourage you to check them out if you're looking for a tablet like this one
and if you want to learn more about it all the specs and details and facts and order yours you can click the link down in my description
if you're new to the channel make sure you subscribe and click all that little notification belt as well so you can notified when
you can also use the pen as a cursor or as a mouse and you can you know maneuver on screen
so it's quite handy it's not that bulky so you can just insert it in your in your bag and bring it up
i leave some links in my description there so that you can go and explore and leave your comments down there so yeah
Anthony from Anthony's customs and for this video we're going to be reviewing the who jaan gt2 22 pen display tablet
it's not a problem especially when you're going to put your face right up against the screen like you will with one of these
if you're leaning over your desk it's you don't want it that bright you don't want to be staring at a screen that close that bright so for me
it's really not an issue at all now as far as the reflections go that could be an issue if you take the screen protector off
I'm going to give it a shot like this and I made up taking it off but so far it does cut down the the reflection issue completely
it's really not noticeable in most cases if you have like a large grey or black spot on your screen you might see a little bit of rainbow effect
they're low on the back of the display so when the cords come out they can bunch up against the table now with this one or the the
I guess could be a problem but I can't see many people folding it all the way flat so it depends on how you use it for me
I love this thing it connects to the back of the unit just like most of the smaller like LCD wall displays for televisions
I always just use hot keys on my keyboard so that's what I prefer so that works out for me some people really do like Express keys
not from like when you're done charging it from when you're using it let's say you use it for two hours
but if you take that screen protector off and are not using an artist gloves you will definitely end up getting catches on your screen as you slide
and it's a very nice glove it fits my hand wonderfully it's a little bit snug so it should fit smaller people's hands okay - and it's made well
Express keys and things so if you're interested in that it's coming in at a really low price for what it is
and the text realtor right yup wreck-it Ralph playing HD cuz the couch again erect the time she's like damn your old man
I've tried before much more comfortable this way since the glove feels more fit adjusted to both thumb up pinky finger here is a USB cable
this is a battery free pen very light more than usual and it also has two side programmable buttons as the standard design
some screws will need later for the stand installation a power cable and another power adapter and last but not least a little screwdriver
For the stand installation we will only need to screw it to the device if you've never had an Ikea experience then this is your opportunity
there's two power adapters but only use the one that fits your needs despite seeing a lot of inputs we'll only need three of them
I'll leave all the links in the description and if you have any questions you can leave them in the comments or direct message me or Instagram
they are usually lots of offers on artistsul official stores from Amazon or Aliexpress and prices are really worth for what they offer
user manual gives you a lot of information about this so in various different languages as well so you can go through this as well
or you've got the regular ones like screen lock and the swipe uh their pin pattern password etc all those options there as well
the rest of them are the basics that any android smartphones or tablets would have like digital well-being and parental controls
you know probably would it our enemy but okay if I can test on anything we say okay they see me pull okay modern economy ok
eb-3 there was a hundred percent chilli that I see with that so my Gita checks back there like the Manya that was in here
I'm trying to attack me with the top of the hood not really fun you get which is not Germany so I go first in could around
oh you two kids so less until I could attend an awkward little thing on the veneer Sonya - I wish - for us overall
over some of the simplified specs it has 32 gigabytes of internal storage you can throw a micro SD card in there at the top
readers dream the size on here and it's gonna do fantastic as a book reader if you love to read you'll definitely want to check this out
I should say that's gonna be known for super high performance and like I said earlier it does run Android 8.1
Greg Iles and it'll search just like anything else for Greg Ulis TV or whatever you're looking for on there you'll see the bottom
also when you swipe down from the top you're gonna have your quick toggles for everything from Wi-Fi Bluetooth do not disturb
then you can go into settings as well and the settings are gonna look pretty much the same as any other
Android device where you can go into you know check battery stats and look at display and mess with the sound
I said and also you get updates in here which is nice so you should be able to get software updates android 8.1
it just have the regular google apps on here and a calculator so it's really not any you know crap apps on here it does have a camera like
that's you know basically very inexpensive very low spec doubt but it's gonna get the job done on most things that you want to do
it's not it's not gonna you can't compare this to a Galaxy S ten or a high-end galaxy tablet or iPad or something like that
which if you're looking for a similar specked out device but you know this one's a little bit higher spec tout you can
well no point at the repair and warranty card that neo core are a British company and they have a fantastic warranty period
inch HD screen so for the price of say a 7 or 8 inch tablet from maybe other manufacturers on the market at the moment
you're getting a really nice 10 inch screen and I think that makes a huge difference 10th from a big jump from 7 and 8 inches to 10
I believe a software update that's been pushed to their recent tablets so I don't hold me to this but I believe a lot of their tablets
so that's fantastic so when you run out of the 16 onboard you can just pop in very cheaply a micro SD card and double triple treble
Kindles I do not know but yeah fantastic feature and a plus point to the N one battery life okay so on paper
I haven't run this one personally for 10 hours yet but if it's anything like the e1 which we also reviewed and I will link below
good media options to push it out to TV and yet up-to-date operating system another fantastic product from the air core
if you've liked this review please give us a thumbs up think about subscribing and we'll be back soon with another product review
Brad Linder with little feuding and this is the Acer Chromebook Tab 10 which is the first Chrome OS device that ships as a tablet
I'm gonna talk a little bit about how can be used for education purposes but also sort of what it means for
I don't necessarily expect students and educators to do but the reason I am running the developer version of Chrome OS
it's really designed first and foremost for the education market and that's all easier is really targeting it towards as a rock tip op1 processor similar to the
it's one point one five pounds pretty easy to hold and the display is definitely one of the strong suits the processor in terms of performance
plex watched a full video on it gets around 9 hours of battery life 9 to 10 hours of battery life
one thing that you'll notice here is there's a X button and a minimize button in the upper right hand corner but there is no resize button
everything that runs on here runs in full-screen mode there's no option to resize preformed windows and just move them around the way that there is on a normal
but some do and that's one that I knew would work and that all application is necessarily run in split-screen mode either
there's a couple of different ways to close application and windows so here we can click the little X button here
we can press and hold just a clothes or we can go to the multitasking view and click the X so closing applications
now this will open your default note-taking app in this case it's Google PEEP which is behaving a little bit weird there
I don't have a lot of things that I can draw and it'll make my picture pretty so the the stylus works reasonably
Titan manga and I think you know waiting about a pound little of us in 1.2 pounds it works pretty well for reading large amounts of text
I don't know that there's a lot of call for doing that in an education setting it works with Google classroom it works with sort of fleet management
IT tools that administrators might want and I think part of what is interesting about Chromebooks in general for Education customers is that they're relatively easy to manage
I can do LSB release a command and I'll show you that essentially what I'm running here is a version of wn9 point for stretch
taking application here called journal and generally speaking things work pretty well again with the caveat that you're gonna have the best results
I think if you do a lot of single tasking when you do too much from multitasking things can get a little bit
but if you were looking for a personal device it's it's a little bit on the chunky side while it's designed for use without a keyboard
I have used it pretty successfully with this Logitech keyboard and all you got to do is go into the Bluetooth settings and pair it and once
Chrome web browser and includes support for Google classroom tools and sort of the ease of use ease of management and security features that come with Chromebooks
this was a wacom paint and that i've used now for four years and it survived through a lot as well as testing out other people's tablets
i even got asked by huion to review one of their tablets a while back but there was no way in hell i would do that
sorry agreed and a few weeks ago i got the tablet sent to me and this is my experience of it so far
the stand is stable and easily adjustable and what i also love is you can just take the tablet off the stand and have it on your lap
tool the brush tool worked amazingly but the pen tool kept bunching up and glitching after i'd drawn the line sometimes it's got really frustrating
a bit and found a button called gamer mode which turns off the pen pressure sensitivity and it seemed to work fine
this is the only issue i found with this tableau which is one specific brush and one specific program which which can be mostly fixed with this button
part and flash so i really don't think it causes any major issues for me inside though this speedpaint is based off floom paul's holly leaf scotland
and i'm not just saying this because of the sponsorship like honestly i would recommend this if you want a screen tablet
if you'd like to consider getting on these tablets then use the link in the description to get a coupon for it
i don't normally do videos like this so sorry if it's not the best but i hope you enjoyed it anyway see ya
she looks at me and think he's so pretty something i can't believe so but i need to understand and in you
there's also time management so you can actually manage their screen time and you can decide how many hours a day that they are allowed to play on it
do all the things that you can do on there is you can actually turn the volume down of this tablet from this phone
this is an Android tablet so it already comes with lots of apps pre-loaded through the Google Play Store millions of apps to choose from
that was exactly my thoughts as well and I can assure you that there is indeed a tablet in here so here
I don't know if the autofocus is working properly and anybody get the autofocus to work but sure enough when you look inside
that's a screen tablet and a screen monitor or display tablets with a column and the difference is with these they act kinda like this monitor
you can see what you're doing what you're doing and then you take the pen and you can draw directly on to the screen graphics
I don't see the point in it for a graphics tablet of this size but yeah it's got an active area of SC no
it's like fifteen dollars and if you're a parent and you're you know your kid wants to get into this kind of stuff
then you can tell if you want to spend a little bit more money and get them the slightly bigger graphics tablet because you can get bigger graphics tablets
I'll put an amazon link as well as a link to Hyun's website so you can check out some of the other products they have while you're down there
thank you all for watching this video and I hope you guys have a wonderful day and I'll see you guys in the next video later
and i'll throw i'm gonna throw a little piece at the end of the video on it and showing how nice that works on here
it goes through full screen video just really well and high definition stuff so and i just love i just love android stuff anyway
i mean it's just my just my favorite so um other than that i mean it has all the menu controls in here
um there's daredevil that was a pretty good one um i mean i can pick about any of them here i mean it it and see
hi guys what's up and welcome to this week's video so this week i will be reviewing the remarkable 2 tablet
writing experience ultimately have all your notebooks in one place so it is aimed at creatives and people who love to write
so let's get into the video so firstly when you get the product it comes in really nice premium packaging when you unbox it
i wouldn't have expected it to be this much but you know what it feels very comfortable and nice to hold
like you can't mimic that feeling of you know when you press down on paper but with that being said it still feels good
i use each one of the features after i unbox the tablet i think within 30 minutes i was completely confident with the tablet
i knew what everything did and i was using everything effectively so there weren't lots of features just to be gimmicky so the files are organized
i'm a bit hesitant to use because when i did use it once um it messed up some of the words
let me know if there's anything that you want me to review and i will see you in my next video so until then you
i had a little bit of difficult because i had to get used to make establish it's a little different from my gaomon tablet but it's awesome
it is simple no secrets and 8 000 levels so enjoy the rest of the video and thank you so much you
we're going to be reviewing the velocity micro cruz tablet which was just released a few weeks ago here in early november 2010
UI has the o2 point nose lock screen and keeps shutting off here okay so this is basically the home screen of the UI
it does have an accelerometer which actually works pretty well as you can see is pretty responsive it does rotate 360
which does have a 10 inch screen and this is a 7-inch so it is actually when we first opened this with we were surprisingly
it's best to view it in landscape where you can get a little better view and then you can just scroll up since it is an Android to point
okay so i got the zoom and pinch back so anyhow that is the browser now works fine the Wi-Fi works fine in this
we're going to go over the pictures first here and you can see does take a second or two for it to load so run this the image
the quality of the video is very poor when you go on line and just using either computer even our again our iPad which has a 1.0
there was very disappointing as we see some of these apps that are actually links to other websites so thought that was kind of poor
it's a full-fledged notepad as well where the pocketbook's more of a dedicated e-reader so let's get back to this comic here
uh just to compare so like the again takes a lot longer to load stuff on the pocketbook than does the onyx
onyx is very quick with that octa-core processor book has a single core dual core or a single gigahertz dual core processor
better look at the background of the blue here so it's a little bit darker another thing with the onyx is
color is definitely better on the onyx though so and speed by a long shot so uh i just find it interesting
um yeah it does translate well to this though because it does make it easier to read on these text balloons so like with the pocketbook
it's but it definitely does uh sort of even the playing field a little bit when you go this way so back to regular now with the onyx
having no boldness enabled so yeah it still looks clearly better on the onyx and here again with the front light front lights a little bit
slot's a big deal for some folks but you know when it comes down to performance and features the onyx kind of blows the pocketbook out of the water
quite frankly but you know i mean it just kind of comes down to what you're looking for in a reading device
so um i mean it can get the job done if you wanted a color e-reader but again with the onyx
let me put this knife away first so I don't not want to stab myself on the side just tap out
oh it shows you how to use a tablet and how to take off the screen off the keyboard and so on so forth
this is to charge the tablet and to transfer files to the tablet as well so put all this back side
megapixel front camera with a 1.9 megapixel of back camera and of course the tablet itself with the keyboard is 3 pounds in total
I'm guessing the reason why the camera wasn't displayed for the public was for the low megapixel quality and of course on the bottom
okay so you got your back button to go back you also have the the home button to go back home to your main screen
you also have the search button so if you press you can search it on whatever platform you're on like right now
I'm on music on the Play Store if you press it again on a home screen you get a Google search as you can see here
the the internet button will take you to your main web browser which is Google Chrome as you can see here
or maybe if you have a video inside your tablet that you downloaded from the SD card even at full screen
here mute the tablet we also have the volume down and the volume up and finally we got the screen off button
so this is the front-facing camera of the tablet using the same microphone and I'm see how they compare what each other
this is the back facing camera using the tablet's microphone and I'm just testing out the quality and see how they compare you
a tablet interval starts lag which this tablet got heated up as soon as I started using it out of the box specifically on the back left side
I wouldn't mind buying this tablet for $60 but anything more than that I wouldn't and of course buying it brand new well
I hope you guys liked this video if you found this video helpful please like and subscribe and I'll catch you guys on the next video peace out
let's just turn this over to show you the back so if you look around the back here we have got a camera on the back with a flash
because they offer up such great value for money and this has got a really good turn of speed absolutely fantastic turner speed pre-installed apps as you can see
at the moment this is at full brightness it is a super super bright screen let me show you this up close
if i show you that close up again you can see the screen or wallpaper that they've got pre-installed on here it's pretty sharp very very nice resolution
the touchscreen does miss the occasional touch input but uh that may be to do with the screen protector so i might try a later
i certainly recommend if you've got a limited budget to spend on something like this and you want something that runs all the google services
i publish new tech videos sometimes more than one every single day and i really do like the community spirit on geekanoids
you can find our tablet and some replacement snips instructions drivers and USB cable a bird is really thin and it has a huge active area also
I'm really excited to say that Huron recently sent to me one of the new 1060 class tablets to review on this channel
I feel like this tablet would be great for traveling because it doesn't take up too much space but it also has a large active area
and they save a lot of time and actually the tablet also has 16 soft keys along the top as you can see
if you're traveling and you're going to using different computers where you can just store your projects in the tablet itself
so the timing of getting this tablet is is awesome and I genuinely had a huge amount of fun working on this painting while testing the tablet
I was checking and testing to see if there's any jittery movements with the pen but it all registered perfectly and smoothly
I would definitely recommend this tablet if you're looking into getting into digital painting and you're looking for your first tablet this would be perfect for you
Hugh sending this if you're interested in this tablets and I'll be sure to leave some links in the description box below for you to check out
I'm looking at today relate to drawing and sketching because that's what I'm using the tablet for I also want to say
I've been using the tablet for a couple of weeks testing it out and I'll be showing my experience in today's video so to start with the unboxing
that come with the tablet including an information booklet a thank-you card and a card showing some art created using the tablet by different artists
I've seen but I didn't mind that at all it felt really nice and sturdy and I didn't feel nervous about carrying it around for this review
I liked about this whole package was that you do not only get the tablet but you also get a case and a pressure-sensitive pen as well
it's a little heavier but it feels very natural in the hand to use and I liked the clip on the side which is useful for clipping the pen
there's also a drawing app pre-installed and that's Autodesk SketchBook for this video I'm using exclusively that app but there are many more available from the Google Play Store
I'm just testing out the pressure sensitivity of the pen seeing how well it glides and just generally getting a feel for everything whenever you use a new tool
needed to adjust to the tools characteristics and just to get to know it a bit to start with the pen and the pressure sensitivity
Autodesk I then moved on to creating a couple of different thumbnail sketches one of the ways I wanted to use
I still do love the feel of a pen and paper though so I am a little torn between the two
working in my sketchbook never nevertheless the tablet is certainly very good for sketching and I then moved on to working on a final piece
the lines drew in almost exactly the same place so I didn't have any issues with the accuracy of the pen when I was drawing one of the things
I hope you enjoyed this review and thank you again to sim bands for sending me the tablet to try out today
make sure you leave any questions you have in the comments down below and I will see you all next time
there is also a regular version of this tablet called the k10 but in today's video we are specifically talking about the k10 pro
however the tablet can also take an sd card so you can easily expand that internal storage for those of you
so on the front of the tablet we have a 10.1 inches ips panel that has a resolution of 1920x1200 for a budget friendly tablet
so you can see the screen no matter how you look at it and it also gets bright enough so you can use the tablet in most situations
you can typically get between five and seven hours of screen on time depending how you use the tablet of course
whenever you're using the keyboard the keyboard actually acts like a protective case over the tablet so the screen is not gonna get damaged
and we have the connector for um the keyboard on the back there we have a 13 megapixel camera and on the front
i've tried a variety of apps even a sketching app because my daughter wanted to draw something with that stylus so everything does work um pretty decent
not sure how smart this is but it is powered by a triple-a battery so overall the whole setup doesn't look that bad
feels like there's something loose in here and yeah if you shake it around a little bit there is something loose
I'm trying to type on it so far not great but I do want to go over the specs for the CPU of the intel celeron in 4000
Windows 10 in S mode but you can easily upgrade to Windows 10 through the Microsoft Store as for the display 10.1 inch IPS 1280 by 800
I think 64 should have been the minimum here but that's not what we have but one thing that I cannot overlook
I always like pulling these things apart just to see how they're cooled and this is using a nice little copper heatsink over the CPU and the chipset
but they're really not that loud even with the volume jacked all the way up in the settings and on the YouTube video
I did run a quick Geekbench and four single core we scored an eleven hundred and thirty usually when I test this same chip and other laptops
I also ran a quick Wi-Fi test and to my surprise it's much faster than I thought it would be with that 2.4 gigahertz download at forty eight point
I'd say the average is around twelve next on the list the original version of Skyrim now for some reason with these Celeron chips
and you'll notice we're not at a constant 60 but with most of the other stuff in the catalog you'll be able to run it perfectly
we have the dolphin emulator running some GameCube games this is Super Mario Sunshine and unfortunately the way they have this chip setup in this tablet
I really appreciate you watching if you have any questions or you want to see anything else running on this little tablet
it'd also be really cool if you could hit that like button or maybe subscribe to the channel but like always
it's time for the unboxing portion of this review every recorded this but dum asked me hit the record button twice so
I wound up with zero footage of the unboxing and about 40 minutes of an empty chair so I'm gonna redo it and feign surprise
I'll link in the description less than half a samsung tablet with similar features the setup is the usual Gmail sign-on procedure
last unpack buttons are on screen so that means their software configurable but it also means they are not physical buttons
look at a side-by-side comparison between the two leading color e-readers using collido 2 or collido plus so here it is on the left
is that even though you have a sunken screen that there is a gel layer in front of all of the assembly to keep that down
i hope it comes off on camera as good as it does with your eyes but this is more white this has more greens in it
the whites on the onyx are a little bit more darkened and gray and the whites on the pocketbook are a little bit more pronounced now
we're going to be referencing that a lot because we learned a lot that having that extra layer on top does in fact disrupt the image
brightness contrast i'm not really sure what the bottom one is i think that was watermark and it kind of pulls certain watermarks from the pdf respectively
you can even launch pdfs with firefox or web browsers if that's what you want to set it to open with
despite what people may or may not think the lights from a glow light front light device do not shine down into the screen or behind it
if you put something on top of the screen you are putting more layers in between the ink screen and your eyes
it is available on our youtube channel at youtube.com good e-reader and for a comparison between the onyx books nova 3 color and the ink pad color
the tablet is equipped with a front and rear camera and I'll be showing some video and picture tests the van
surprisingly this tablet reminds me of the Nexus tablets from Google many years ago which was one of my favorite tablets in my opinion
ok so let's jump into some picture and video tests on the front-facing camera and the rear facing camera so in conclusion
I have to say I really enjoy the slim design of this tablet I think 8 inches is the perfect size for any type of tablet
i like the fact that you can use it as a tablet or you can connect a detachable keyboard now a couple of years ago
and this is the thinkpad x12 detachable gen 1 coming up the x12 detachable is a direct competitor with the surface pro 7
i have a new series called renewed review and i will have the surface pro x which i picked up for less than six hundred dollars
we've seen as of late so you get that egg carton crate which is a little bit more bio-friendly or eco-friendly
you get some documentation which includes some warranty information and a setup guide you also get a 65 watt power adapter
find out more in that upcoming series review renewed coming very soon and so far very comfortable to type on especially on that race typing angle
uh this is a 1440p video 30 frames per second on this thinkpad x12 detachable let me know what you think about it in the comment section below now
it's an infrared camera that means you can log in with face recognition and this is my very messy studio and this is a little bit behind the scenes
but i think you get the picture so this is the main console but let me know what you think about it in the comment section below
let's talk about the pen which is included at no additional cost something that's not the case with the surface pro 7 or 7
i don't think but definitely there for convenience and an area where it really shines over the surface pro 7 is battery life
it did 11 hours and 12 minutes on my continuous web surfing test over wi-fi at 115 it's that was really good in terms of all-day battery
that's not what this is designed to be but definitely respectable performance for a thin and light two-in-one now my unit has eight gigabytes of lp ddr4 x ram
especially if you're in the market for a surface pro 7 or 7 plus i think business users and consumers alike will both love this offering
i'm gonna give this my editor's choice for the two in one detachable category here for early 2021 making the x12 detachable definitely worth your money
megapixels you can get 1440p at that front-facing camera and that's going to be great for zoom and skype when we're working from home
and it wasn't bad as you saw from the video and the performance has actually been pretty good with that core i5 1130 g7
so you're getting good battery life but you're not sacrificing too much performance which is actually pretty good for something this thin and light now
it's a really good display full hd plus resolution 12.3 inches 1920 by 1280 that is a 16 to 10 aspect ratio
don't forget to check me out on facebook twitter instagram and of course my website amd techreviews.com so until next time this is andrew from amd tech see ya
Lenovo already had a respectable mid-range surface pro clone with the mix 510 so instead of scrapping the thing entirely and starting fresh
it kept a design and made a couple of tweaks to just make the whole thing better and called it the mix 5:20
let's start with the design though again it's essentially unchanged from the 510 which means it's pretty much identical to the old surface
Pro for the built-in kickstand is nice and strong and uses lenovo's watchband hinges that give you a big positioning range
its touchpad is on the small side which could be frustrating but there is a 12 point 2 inch touchscreen right in front of you
is this little plastic piece that not only ties up your USB port but partially blocks the power jack in USB C port
so what you just saw was a quick unboxing of the star g960s from xp pen a tablet in the market at a cool 80 dollars now
the ph3 battery free stylus two small form-factor usb to usb-a adapters a usb-c cable and some documentation some immediate things to note here that the pen feels fantastic
the four buttons are all quite clicky and provide nice tactile feedback as i'd expect and overall the footprint and form factor blended with good build quality
it doesn't stick out at all which may sound like a plus but i found that when i actually wanted to use it pressing down on
it wasn't easy and it feels somewhat awkward due to how flush it is and how small the pen is overall
my drivers were stable and i tested the tablet in krida photoshop and clip studio with no issues and this includes
although i can't say the same for the one on the pen but really this tablet does its main function best and that's drawing in a really satisfying way
if you like my work consider joining my discord server down below and i will see you all again in the next video
pakka blocks calm crayon has sent me and not a tablet to check out this is the Inspiron g 10 key
it seems like we don't have used the previous box except a piece that this sticker over that says at this pan now supports 8,192 levels of pressure sensitivity
this uses a USB type a and this case of a USB type a this is a USB type-c this is for charging the tablet
if use quite nice to hold and here is tapered and there's no resided back because there is this tiny little hole here for charging the pen
the drawing area by the way is ten by six point two five inches so this is considered a medium sized tablet
but it has a slight texture to it a very smooth non-glossy sort of texture so it feels very nice when drawing with the pen
I have also tested driver and a tablet with Windows and on Mac and Windows that have that it works very well so right now
there's no way to customize the function so you are only able to use all the functions that are listed here personally
there were a lot of bucks with the rotating function so in the second generation they remove the ability to rotate all together and that
if you are left-handed user you can rotate the tablet here you can rotate it 180 degrees so that the trackpad is developing on the left side
like this they are also very smooth now one thing about MIDI Bank is when you use the trackpad to pinch to zoom
Krita pressure will here as well very nicely and the trackpad it can zoom down but I cannot zoom back up
it works so that's all for the quick demonstration just to show you some of the strokes that this tablet and the pen can create
which is an 8 inch tablet with the 1280 by 800 pixel display one gig of ram 16 gigs of storage and an Intel Atom Bay Trail processor
kitkat software with a custom user interface from Asus called Zen UI has a couple of nice touches including a frequently used applications tab here the pull down
so you'll need to use that tab from time to time if you want to adjust the display settings other features
you might not notice the full stereo effect five megapixel rear camera two megapixel front facing camera power and volume buttons headset
there's also for some reason a custom calculator and web browser but you can also use Google Chrome and let's do that
I'm pretty happy with this with this tablet especially in the $1.99 price range and if you can find it on sale a little bit cheaper
so you can see you know the Kindle application when it's up and running you don't see much other than the book that you're reading
I don't know why it's taking a second to load text but everything else goes away and it just feels like I'm reading a book
same goes for the video game like we just saw our full screen video so most of the time the user interface sort of gets out of the and
I suppose having the number key at the top is kind of nice but it looks a little busy a little distracting
is that just like with the wet black-owned you don't need a battery which is really really good most other competitors that
you can put it on keyboard and and it's great because it gives you that flexibility while working so right now this is on e4 eraser yeah cuz
that's a great plus and an advantage that I haven't have not seen yet from any welcomed competitors out there yeah definitely would recommend so
i was given the opportunity to be one of the very few people to review vic's newest display which recently just released as of recording this
i still use my vague vk 1560 and they're finally stepping up to provide more affordable products for us digital artists which is awesome so
this tablet is already ready for purchase on the zada which links are in the description down below the retail price for
the first thing we see from the box is the smudge glove which i'm happy to see along with the tablet nicely stored in the box underneath it
i tend to misplace my pen sometimes so i'm glad i have a spare just in case as for the pen's features it's the usual standard pen
the coating is matte so it's very comfy to hold and it has the usual two express buttons for you to calibrate and adjust later
we got here a pen holder but with more nibs to store in it like this is already a lot of nibs
it has six hotkeys customized express keys which makes your work process much easier and supports up to 60 degrees of tilt pen pressure
setting this up was a breeze because you only have like two cables to connect them together so i got no issue on that um as you see
the size of this display monitor is almost the same size as ipad pros so i hope this visual will help you see how small this tablet is
i love the characters and also kaiman is voiced by the same voice actor of okuyasu from jojo's bizarre adventure part 4.
it was small almost the same size as an ipad pro the way it was built almost the same thickness as an ipad is amazing
that means you can take this tab on the go and not worry about having the power cable and have so many cables taking up space and electrical port
so this part i hope you enjoyed the whole process and the contents this display has to offer anyways giveaway ty the lovely people over at bake
all links to their official accounts are on the description down below so you can just click on there number two answer this question
yeah something just along those lines and let me know in the comments below and one of you might just win your very own
i hope this review was helpful for you guys and i'm looking forward to the giveaway winner which i'll be announcing in the next video
now also note that there's a volume key on the side which you have access to of the response through the silicone cover
I'm a fan of silicone casing or are all manner of device protection but one of the things that tends to get a little touchy is
they've actually got this cradle perfectly matched to fit this tablet with this silicone casing on and I tell you from personal experience of going through
many many many display stands having a stand that actually can fit a robust thick silicone case is rare extremely rare extraordinarily rare
yes as soon as you bring it up towards yourself it is actually quite clear and vibrant but that is the inherent nature of IPS displays
and you really are not going to escape that until you really get up into the 100 $130 range all IPS
it's an add-on environment to really protect the tablets and your child from undue wandering but it also functions as a standard Android tablet
but let's just say here having a full non partition memory meaning no device memory / internal storage division is pretty huge
it's a great thing to actually finally see that happen on these budget tablets because up to this point for the most part
and whenever you just do that initial pairing just like that you turn them on you look for it under bluetooth tap it
it's paired and whenever you turn on or off the headphones on a later date when you turn them back on
headphones headphones bluetooth headphones specifically designed for children in the past and they had a result had a very very very small head
that actually even fit on my head and it's got a lot of features thrown in on a pair of bluetooth headphones it does have an FM transmitter
they've thrown into these little pair headphones as well as fitting my head as well as being suitable for our child's
i would have liked to have been just a little bit cheaper and i think it would have just um spiked my interest a little bit more
if you are in other countries there are these two plugs included so you can just slide it on like this
and at the bottom right side here we have the the imprint so for the cover you can ban it at this area here
it is actually almost as good as the surface pen it features a full metal body and the size shape is almost similar with the sim bends
this is an active pen and it's powered by a battery so there is a small AAA battery that powers the pen
this hot plastic tip feels a bit slippery on the screen so it does take a while to get used to using the pen to draw or to write
this is a nice matte surface but of course when you put it in the case this does not matter now
HDMI port so if you want to connect this tablet to an external monitor or TV you can do so the HDMI cable is not included
so this is a bit lower than I expect it for the price that this tablet is selling at I cannot complain too much about the resolution
it's a bit on the lower side but that's because this is a lower pricepoint tablet the OS the Android OS included is the version 7
I can customize icons I can customize wallpaper it's actually no different from other Android devices so let's test out the drawing functionality now
it appears that there is some parallax and there is some parallax because there is no way to compensate for the parallax
that is something that is not um there is something that I'm not able to do consistently so I accidentally pressed my palm on the screen again
alright let me test out the pressure sensitivity pressure sensitivity works really well but as you can see we have some jitter lines again
now this is the velcro that's going to go behind this part here to secure the tablet now with the case on
I drew a few days ago outdoors while I was with my friends at a cafe so this was drawn on location
this app is a bit more processor intensive so it takes a bit more time for the lines to render before they appear
this is welcome bamboo paper the app that I usually use to take notes so I'm going to show you how well it can capture my handwriting
I was expecting a lot more the last app I want to try out is MIDI Bank paint Pro on Android
I suggest you start out with the free apps and see if you can one of them if not you can check out the paid apps
the downside is it takes quite a long time to charge up the tablet so you can leave it overnight to charge but the battery life
the brightness well this is currently at the brightest setting there is a limited range of brightness and you cannot go too bright you can go to dim
so this is the dmoz setting and this is the brightest setting so the range of brightness is actually quite limited overall performance of the tablet
I can quit some of the apps and just focus on the ones that I'm using so that's not too much of a problem
alright this review has gone on long enough so let me just quickly tell you the things that I like and dislike
I did not like about the screen the speakers they are not that good the drawing apps some of the drawing apps they have very obvious diagonal line
this is us $200 the Samsung tab as three with the s-pen is 400 or 450 dollars and above so overall this is quite a decent budget
you can visit that through the link in the video description below and if you have any questions do let me know in the comment section
I will post all the information about the specifics of this tablet below but this is the canvas GT 156 HD version 2
this tablet is really awesome because of the fact that it is flat rather than some other tablet monitors that are pretty thick
where it's got a bunch of different kinds of adapters for your ear plug so if you live in another country
I'm just gonna do a little demonstration of a new drawing and I will give you some more information about this tab
you know you pay for both the brand and the quality however there are many tablets out there that are there
the only difference is it's a different brand so basically you know this tablet isn't exactly like a Wacom but let me tell you
I've had that for like five years and I've been using that for a long time so I've really really used to that tablet
I think on the market in terms of tablets right now and it's what the Wacom I thin cheek I think has that if not the Cintiq
and it's nice so you know if those are my that's my two cents about the specifics of this tablet you know
so that's a fixable thing and it works really well for me and I'm very happy with this tablet I love the pressure sensitivity
like for what you're getting and you're avoiding the huge huge price increase when you go to a brand like back home
I hope you guys enjoyed this video and I hope my review of his tablet was helpful to you at all again
let's get right in and here's the picture of everything it includes also um in this part of the box it has the table
well for today we have something that looks like a tablet because we have an 8 inch screen but this is also a mini
PC running Windows 10 so we have all the ports on the back here so you can connect this to a TV or monitor
this is called the goalie one plus and it cost somewhere around 220 to 240 dollars depending where you buy it from now
let's start to the very quick unboxing so the ghuli one class comes in a plain looking box and all we can see on
so you can screw them behind the the mini PC and this way the mini PC can stand by itself so you can comfortably see it now
the other one needs to be made out of metal so the sides here are all made up of plastic and the only metallic part that we have
the colors are nice and vibrant however the viewing angles aren't the best and the screen doesn't seem to get as bright
I'm also going to play a game play a few video fun so you have a better idea how this would perform for day-to-day tasks
we're not connected to the web the internet and then this is the Wi-Fi for first benchmark test you get a score of 519 and discouraged somewhat similar
PC so I'm just going to click on the first one so this is the video card that we have on Intel HD graphics
the cpu is the intel's at 8350 and moving back one more time we're going to check out the RAM and the four gigs of ram
maps is that watching youtube videos is not the best experience because the videos don't seem to go totally totally smooth
it works okay but not the best that I've seen so everything is kind of in a slow motion as you control it up
it is like a lag and it kind of stops so another best experience for coding and since we have called the open down
I will just open it and we wait and the mouse is not working anymore so I'm definitely not the best experience for watching movies
when they start they do seem to go okay but again as soon as you move the mouse or anything like that
it seems to go okay but as soon as you touch anything next thing kind of stops so for example so
oh let's just go on a 4k file out of curiosity and see what happens so we have a 4k file
but basically if you do this you get the exact same results at home so these are all the files bite right
because based on the specs or based on paper it should work much much better but yeah a reality doesn't work on
if one of the nibs you're using is starting to get dull or worn out you can easily replace it with another one
... I did contact a friendly company "gaomon" and they agreed to send me a graphic tablet to do a review in fact
I did not think they would answer me, I sent the email saying: "Hi, I'm an influencer, can I review your tablet?"
and I thought, "nah, they will say no, it can't be that good" and then they answered me saying "yes" and I was like ... (exit) :D
It also has a touch disk which is used with the finger, I use it to zoom and it is really comfortable
(¿ idk, but it is cute also brings a bag in case you want to put the tablet there, the fabric is very soft
In addition, if you write to them by mail, both in Spanish and English they will answer you even if the company is Chinese
I'm animating a part of a meme that I don't know when I'll upload, but .. it's about kristaler! :D .... remember kristaler? ;;;
ok, the video is over, but before I finish ... I wanted to show some drawings that made me special people who draw beautiful
I will also leave the links to their social media in case you want to give them some luv bye <3
Joanna for The Verge and this is the Nook Tablet which is Barnes and Nobles new update to the Nook Color and their competitor to the Amazon fire
and as you can see immediately from looking at the design it looks exactly like the color but that's not really a bad thing
they've also kept the hook in the left hand corner which is a nice design element but not really all that useful
I've actually found it to be a little bit brighter than the Kindle Fires and the viewing angles to be a bit better Barnes & Noble
when you're on the home screen itself you can customize it with apps and books and you can also resize the icons of course
Barnes & Noble has a big book selection and they've also added some new features including a read and play and read and record function
Fire and why you might get nicer hardware and better specs and double the memory a Kindle Fire definitely provides a better ecosystem for downloading music video and apps
I'll share my thoughts about the screen as well as looking at some of the differences between this newer model and the previous Galman screen
there's also a drawing glove which can work both on the right and the left hand if you wear it on the left hand then
the logo is on the underside of the glove but the glove does work on both hands using a drawing glove
there were also two plug options included in the box as well so that's what's included in the box and now moving on to set up
I first assembled the power cord and then plugged the USB and video cable into the tablet and then plugged the two other cables into my computer
I set up the tablet on my desk and headed over to the Galman website and downloaded the latest version of their driver
it's always a good idea to get the latest driver from the website as the most updated versions tend to have fixes for any bugs or performance
I was getting lots of variation and the pressure sensitivity was working really really well just the same as the previous gallon model that
now this is a personal preference for me but if anyone else has smaller hands then this information might be useful another change from the previous
I'm working in different layers sketching first then line art then a layer of base coloring and then adding a layer of shadows and highlights in terms of performance
there was a strip on the top of the tablet that was consistently warm even after working on the tablet for just a few minutes
I'm used to working on a much larger screen and it definitely took me a while to get used to the smaller working area
I did find though that after about an hour so I did get used to it and it didn't end up slowing down my process at all
I also found myself resting the tablet on my lap quite a bit as I was working on this drawing today
Galman does also have larger tablets available if you have a bigger budget or you want a larger screen to work on
I didn't have any issues working with the tablet except for one time when the Pens stopped working and I couldn't move the brush around anymore to fix that
I just pulled up the gown on Settings box reset everything to default the tablet on and off and then the pen worked again
it took a little bit of time to get used to but it certainly has some advantages the pressure sensitivity on the pen was as always very good
there wasn't any noticeable lag or delay when working the screen resolution is also good and the colors came out really nicely as well
there's 20% of this tablet and other products for the whole month of October and I'll put links to all of that in the description box below
please feel free to leave any questions you have in the comments down below and I'll do my best to get back to you
yeah it is different and i believe you can hang it from there but yeah i think it is the main reason of this unique design anyways
it starts working so it is a plug and play option like most graphics tablets and i will use pdf annotator to test it
okay first of all guys i like the top of the surface um it is really good and i also like the pen
i searched for nino's m driver on google and went to pablo's website but there is only one download option and it's just for windows
luckily i have a windows computer but there should be more right and there should be a link for other operating systems
i think pablo needs to fix this issue because the tablet looks promising but the website doesn't anyways we finally installed it and here it is
this is super slim and it has a usb type-c connection and also this has an android mode and pen is also good
i think three different colors so you can check the links in the description below and see what colors they offer
I met you will not be able to escape the known fact that it is an Amazon Kindle considering that everything on there is pretty much named after Amazon
there is no major delay in switching through apps or waiting for something to particularly load and the overall impression does feel nice and fluid
it wasn't really a noticeable difference however please note that not all games are currently available for it including the number one
Mario run now like I previously said the Amazon 7 is not entirely perfect and unfortunately does come with a few drawbacks for example
I think the main thing to remember is of course the price that you'll pay for this because it is not set out to be an iPad beta
if you're going to use it for simple video watching maybe some web browsing or shopping and of course the odd bit of note making than this
it most certainly isn't the West ok then and that pretty much sums up our quick review for the Amazon fire
what you need to do is put the screws in these four holes on the stand and then align it on the back of the tablet
you can calibrate the monitor change which monitor you want the tablet to be active on and change the active area of the tablet itself
the stylus pen has a few adjustable levels of pressure sensitivity and you can format the two buttons on the side to just about anything you want
Goemon the tablet stand the setup manual and driver instructions a box full of cords and stuff the tablet container and the tablet itself
it does a very good job of simulating the feeling of drawing on paper but I personally like it without the cover because the screen looks better
whatever your preferences don't immediately peel it off and throw it away like I did try it out and see if you like it first
a screen glove guard and the digital pen itself the glove guard fit very nicely and I would recommend using it because the screen shows fingerprints very easily
obviously the software is simply not good if you use more than one drawing program or a drawing program and an animation program like
but if you're going for something that feels a bit more high-end than this isn't it now on to the good things about the tablet first off
compared to other drawing tablets other tablets of the same screen size usually go for anywhere from 100 to 300 dollars more speaking of price there is an Amazon
and sometimes i'd accidentally press the wrong button whilst drawing and it was especially the bottom button and sometimes when i press the top button it didn't register
this one's rare and it's only happened to me three times but sometimes the drivers don't detect the cintiq at all
these are sporadic and i don't need to restart drivers or anything and the last time that happened was about two weeks ago
i like the fact that it also doubles as a monitor which is really good because i can use my main monitor
if you really want express keys and i would get a rack and remote which will set you back 100 pounds
i'm sure you have quite hard to use a computer without a keyboard or you can make your own remote using a numpad
it got rather annoying because in the middle of a drawing i was like oh i want to do this thing so i have to put my pen down
i set all my favorite shortcuts to it and it just works so well with my tablet and it's great so my review for the xp pen
so if you don't care about express keys or anything you just want your cintiq and this is the tablet for you
yes if you're like me and find it very hard to draw with a screenless tablet then the cintiq 16 is the tablet for you anyways
and if you like this video and you want to see more you can subscribe and you can follow me on instagram and tumblr
so i'll just draw each frame and then if you're in onion skin mode then you will have this option to export each layer as its own individual file
which is really useful if you have a bunch of layers and you don't want to go export them one by one
but it's worth it and there that's how i'll usually make a little scene here and there now the rest of this video you'll see
um you know it's very difficult to get into digital art when you don't have a tablet and this tablet is very affordable you know it
if you click the home button you can always take you back to the home screen and Samsung has added this one more button
and you can easily customize the same if you want to customize it you click this plus button and here you can
it'll list the most visited sites that you have recently browsed and now let me just load one of the sites
it is almost as fast as a desktop computer so it was great to browse on this tablet and because of the increased resolution
you can easily close the tab by clicking on this X and overall I found the browsing to be a very good experience on this tablet
and let's get out of the browser also as this is an Android tablet you get access to the complete Android Market and that also works great
iPad apps the choice that you get with iPad apps are little bit more so the Android Market is great and it works without any issues
the screen of this tablet is really brilliant and it is great to actually watch videos on the same and as this tablet supports dual-core processor
let me pause this so playing videos also is a great experience and actually you can easily watch movies on this tablet also
is that the rear facing camera that we have is just a 3 megapixel camera and it can shoot video only at 720p HD not Full HD
and if you just tap on the same you get a menu like this where you can quickly toggle between your notification
let's say if you have a gmail account or something if you have any you mail notification etc all will pop up over here also one more thing that
so what are my conclusions regarding this tablet if you are in the market looking for an android-based tablet give a serious
you will find a usbc port for charging and connectivity located along the bottom you will find the two speaker ports now
is that it actually comes with a clean vision with no bloatway and only the basic google apps installed as standard
as i said it's not the best i've ever heard but it's certainly not the worst so to give you my final thoughts on the dragon touch max 10.
you're getting a tablet with three gig of ram 32 gig of storage clean android 9 os large screen fantastic battery life
if you want to get yourself one i will also put a link to the dragon touch website in there as well
we will show it from the side also soon and compared of course with an iPad 2 which is the reference model
HD videos but I think online HD videos like in the browser with YouTube are even more interesting because I have for example
I will go full HD a full screen and then you will see on and then you will see that it plays actually really nice
my internet isn't slow so it's not because of that if it would be a little bit slower but yeah of course
iPad tool then got a new one and this is one we one actually and so we saw the HD video that plays really nicely
we already had that open so you can go to another your ground and then you see another level and it looks really nice
I missed a bird but I don't care and because we want to go on for example Google Maps is pretty interesting
let's go here to in composite email and then you can switch through different languages which you can set up manually have Hungarian German and English
this swipe is really nice because you can just go on with writing and with for example is and then and we have great oops the a is there
you can choose color and so on and so on you can hide this if you need more space and well
of course a little bit more about that you get the basic feeling here you have to of course run a little bit new stuff
Google and we have the Mobile World Congress coming up so there's a lot of things happening there but it's of course not that hard to use
we can go inside here check out my University and so on and so on so thank you much watching a level TV this was a test of them
then we have here the headphone and microphone port micro SD card reader and as already said this is the micro HDMI which we are using right
I think it's 3 megapixels and we have 5 megapixels on the back which only shows my hand right now but actually it's not bad
I can't I can't fault it on anything the only thing I disliked about it and I don't know whatever was just this unit was the volume button
like there's like full five windows and this you wouldn't know which you're on speed wise is very very good to take a four processor works impeccably
I probably should have but I bought in a DDS shield so I started playing on that a little bit more
I'm selling this is because I purchased a new Lumia 2520 and I just wanted and just all I wants to change
I do think the keyboard setup is a stroke of genius it works very very well it protects the most important part really
and that's the screen you know because I'm a stickler for screens and if some scratches up or damages the screen it really annoys me so it's nice
in the fact that you get two years 200 gigabytes two years is is great values so basically this is a good item
this is worth the money and it really has a premium feel to it so if you're on the fence go up one and maybe a
Amazon for just leaving it outside for anyone to take (Jazzy Music Plays) Hi, I'm GingerPale and Huion was nice enough to send me this tablet to review!
Yeah, we go, and then I figured out what this one's for this is this is a USB so we put that one in
inch display you can fit like two subway footlongs in there if if you shrunk them a little some people worry about pen battery life you just
[clapping noises and party noises] So, thank you very much, Huion, and there's a link to the tablet in the description couldn't be here without you guys
if you're not looking at it head-on the display is also widescreen which is great for streaming movies and TV shows as well as playing games on the back
there really wasn't any bloatware installed on the tablet and in fact some useful applications like Adobe Reader came pre-installed overall the performance of the stodgy duel is great
thanks to the octa-core processor if you're into higher-end Android gaming or simply want a response at the tablet for surfing the web
that's never has tablet before or if you're just looking for a media consumption type tablet this guy will work out pretty good
it can playback 1080p files even though it had doesn't have a 1080p screen and they look good so you can watch YouTube
you're going to have your power button you're going to have a 5 volt in DC plug which I don't understand why they did you can
that actually sounds pretty good for a $38 tablet and then you have a front facing speaker as well so not too shabby for a $38 tablet
I've got chrome of good Gmail Google+ Maps everything you know and I mean it's all it since it's Google certified
you know once it's in there and loading see it's it does take a couple seconds to load up those thumbnails but then once you do it
that's going to be constant with this tablet again for a budget tablet but it will play and I'm not the greatest at Temple
Run but I'll give it a give it a quick go here for you guys and play a couple seconds of it
I'm just terrible at temple room so I mean you know not bad no crazy slowdowns or stuttering or you know of the game not responding or not playing
and you know and it's gonna take its their sound is actually really good for $40 tablet even though it's rear-facing so not bad at all
another thing that the cameras that you've got a front and a rear we'll go and take a look at the front camera
I have a hard time beating this tablet up because of the price point the fact that I can play basic 3d games
you don't get bluetooth but hey you know you can't have everything for $40 so this guy works out really well it's got you know
yeah so it's going to ask me to get started and do all that fun stuff but it works as all the Google product to do and it doesn't
leave them in the comment section below and I'll get back to you guys and we'll check you out on the next video
it's made of full metal body giving it that nice premium feel that doesn't easily show fingerprints and it's not too thick
although not able to use outside in daylight on top is a 2 megapixel camera are useful for Skype with another camera on the back
SD card slot on the top is the power button and the volume controls and to the left is the speaker
the bottom is where you'll see the 5 pin magnet to connect to the keyboard on the bottom of the screen
there's also a tablet mode which is more simple to use when you're just using the tablet by itself gaming on this is horrible
one thing that is nice is it has a pop-out stand so you can prop it up like so to use it to give you an idea of the
you can see it's quite a bit larger device the Arco seven is not a foam this is just an Internet tablet and a multimedia tablet
Android 1.5 that's pretty all that's the original release of Android it was first available on the t-mobile g1 since this is not a phone
there's an 800 by 480 pixel display same as high-end phones like the Motorola Droid X only obviously stretched to 7 inches
Wi-Fi off and on again and now pages are loading so we'll show you what the on-screen keyboard looks like and how it renders our website
loaded looks just fine since this is a standard Android browser it doesn't always reliably load ads but I'm sure you won't be too sad about that
there are no hardware volume control surprising for a multimedia oriented device you have volume controls right up here on the menu bar pervasively in most applications
we have some high quality content on here at the Transformers video which is an 800 by 480 pixel video at a very high bitrate in mp4 format
it's good enough for private listening in your hotel room and it doesn't come at this set of okay quality earbuds
of course you can use your own 3.5 millimeter stereo headset with this instead for better listening so there's a pretty good job of clean
the screen quality isn't bad to look at it's not a superb screen but pay for $1.99 on the seven inch machine
Marco's claims seven hours of video playback time we didn't see that we got maybe more like four four and a half
I think this name is either Phoenix your Phoenix the cute little fox guy that we pointed out on the 24 inch tablet
I love being able to see what I'm doing but 16 is a pretty same size for most people in fact I had to rearrange my entire workspace
but let's see what this is like it's gonna be considerably easier to open because the Box opens just like this
I don't know if this is a gift that they give out to people who purchase their tablets or not but there we go
I want to show this tablet off and I want to show you how big it is compared to boos Wacom tablet now
yeah and it just kind of rests on the stand and you can you know just work right off your tabletop if you want to
it could fit in a very large laptop bag but it's actually wider than my gaming laptop which is a a 17 inch 17 inch screen
I will put a link to that in the description of the video but yeah I love it I love how portable it is
I do like a bigger screen when working on comics projects but I really enjoyed drawing on this tablet after I got the driver issue worked out
it's all one unit very much like the wacom one was where you've got one plug and it's just it's very easy
I'm going to see you guys out with the speed drawing of the character that I drew with this tablet and be on the lookout for more art videos
so it's the cute 11 K tablet and you can tell it because it says it on the side all right
um let me check the let's check its stats real quick like size-wise and stuff like that is on the back
okay so here are the two pieces so I know for sure it should come with or does it come with nibs
I don't even know but you can put your nibs in here and we're just gonna close this up because I know I'm gonna use this
I actually have a wireless tablet and I know this is for connecting your tablet and this is for charging your pen
Sai with any tablet so I was just using pencil side with this tablet as well and I really have to say
it takes me maybe 30 minutes to get kind of adjusted and this one only took me like 2 or 3 minutes and I was like woah dude
I felt like I had to adjust with was that I had so much space because I usually don't have so much space so I was like
I'm drawing on my actual screen but I'm not and it was just kind of like me adjusting though I'm loading it and setting it up was pretty easy
I just wanted to kind of like let you guys know that I finally tried out the hue on and I'm really liking it
I think it's really good if you have if you can and you have the ability to get it then definitely go for it
I say at this point and the pen is really lightweight too so I was like there's nothing I can say
let me know in the comments if you guys liked this format if not then let me know in the comments anyway
it has a lot of express case and just looks and feels really nice and here we have all the fancy extra bits just like the last one
i hope you've enjoyed this video and look forward to the next one and i'll see you guys later bye so you
it's like pencil thin and it's just got a nice round edge feels great in the hand i think almost better than the ipad with those sharp edges
it's gonna be a little hard to see with all the reflection on the camera there but dude this is awesome
it means that it's not going to be sideways when you want it to be up and down or left and right right now
the one thing that i really want to call out in this and you can see the stock wallpaper on here
i mean if we really get in there i mean you'd be a judge you would not be looking at it this closely but it looks great
it is bright it is clear and that video looks great and if i turn it sideways here you know it's just it's just incredible
now one of the things that i want to do here is tell you that i think this is the orientation you are supposed to use this with
that puts the camera up there so it unlocks nicely and then it also puts the controls here so the volume is in the right position
i do want to say here that the other thing i like is as far as i can tell this is like just an unskinned version of android
they haven't done something here to brand it and put a bunch of bloatware on it and i really love that
it's just easier than trying to figure out someone else's skin version which they think is optimal so it works right out of the box
it's nice and speedy and if you know how to use the google play store and download the apps and get those set up like this i mean
you know three or four hundred dollars would be a good deal on something like this but it is a fraction of that
this tablet when i picked it up was about a hundred and seventy dollars so for that normally you would be looking at something
i mean even an ipad mini starts around three or four hundred bucks so this thing to me represents just an amazing value
that might be my camera though on reflection but I could see a little bit of that not a problem though
it's been a long time since anyone sent me stickers and I've got to say I am a complete sticker fiend
this does have eight hot keys and one rotary ring as well which is quite good and I'm fully happy with this
Oh mystery boxes if you're a regular to my channel you know that I love mystery boxes now the first one
obviously it's the pen and it comes in a nice small case which has a number of replacement nibs and of course the nib remover itself
USB see a nice HDMI input and it's easy to set up and then get straight to my calibration tests my calibration was nice and straightforward normally
I wanted it to I was getting the thin lines and everything was coming out fine when I move on to testing pen pressure and initial Einstein
it didn't put me off so much because I'm used to just reading the color values rather than looking at the screen
so yeah not so much about bear for me but you might want to spend a bit longer over a few weeks color
calibrating it to make sure it's precise bu there are tools out there but they're a bit more expensive so I never I never Bob with them
you know there's also the fact that I'm capturing it on video and my video will also have a bit of color misrepresentation
the fact that is host powered the fact that if you have a laptop you could plug this into it and that way it would work something similar to
the tablet really does hold up with your wrist on it and it feels really stable and I was happy with that
Here I am and I'm using it kind of right-handed so I've got their buttons on the other side of me and that really works
I was convinced while I'd done something wrong but it stood up to the challenge of what I wanted it to do
this is just the creepy man from my imagination although it is based on Dracula family honor the original Bram Stoker's kind of portrayal of Dracula
I love big big drawing tablets but if your style is vector R or more for sketching then this tablet is gonna be more suited for you
quality 1080p screen quality in some senses is good enough if you're editing videos if you're a photographer retouching high-resolution photography then
say if you're doing sketch work if you're doing cartoons if you're doing did your painting even then 1080p is fine the reason
the stylist who is taking its commands and it's moving quickly enough and there's no lag now lag is a bit of a misnomer love digital lights
and it's not the computer that you're using is the reason for the lack realistically if you're drawing then only have one application open
I don't have multiple applications open at the same time I have a powerful computer and I still when I'm paying
I don't know otherworldly I could start adding in kind of a halo light and yeah something about it at this point what
I realized this is something I could take and work up into another painting and I was really happy with this
I can work faster as well and I've got to say you know the things that I would love to see brought into Pablos stylus if possible again
keep on being creative and I will see you in the next drawing tablet review we are also going to be doing some absolutely great vs. rounds
this is anybody else you know in the comments what you want to see this drawing tablet versus and we shall make it happen as long as it's something
so I've had it a few years now and I went with the Huey on because it was half the price of a Wacom sinky tablet
they were going the way comms were going for around a thousand bucks on Amazon and Huey on was going for pretty much half the price and I've read
I should have done more in depth of research which I didn't do so there's just a warning for someone who's owned this tablet for a few years
it might be half the price but still in my opinion of the spend 500 bucks on a piece of electronic equipment
she's writing a story and this is her main character in that story so she sent me a description of what she wants so
I've drawn the character and right now I'm inking it and I'm gonna color it later on but I'm doing this on a Wacom
I paid like I think 60 bucks for that Staples and that was quite a few years ago before I got my huion and it works perfect
Wacom and avoid the huion because it might seem cheap but to me it totally is not worth it so for
hello everyone it's rayneco alright for short um and before this video starts i just want to put a little bit of disclaimer
so it's not very convenient to me but having this tiny display tablet for once was actually a joy to have in the box
like a tablet holder that is positioned in a diagonal way so it supports your wrist and your neck so it wouldn't hurt that much
but i kind of want to suggest that it would be probably better if it's mandatory to have at least a tablet holder along with the entire package
all you have to do is find the driver of the tablet in the official website of common and download it
you all probably want to know more about how it came out in my end so without further ado i will give my drawing review
you'd notice that i didn't use any pen pressure for the line art because i'm trying to test how good it would handle the strokes
that's it for my review for gaomon pb1161 and before you ask if i have any tablets to recommend in the comments
and then i'm going to be showing you my experience with each drawing tablet as well as the process of this particular illustration over here and so
yeah stay tuned if you are interested in that and so as you guys probably know if you're not new to my channel
and then the other thing that i own that i got a number of years ago is an ipad pro with the with the apple pencil and so obviously
the tablets that are going to be featured in today's video are the star g640 the deco 01 version 2 and lastly the artist 12 pro
i imagine and i can't believe that they even have the actual line play mascots like on the actual tablet and also how crazy thin is that
how adorable cable you know so when xp pen had asked me to work with them they had said that the products were co-branded
oh my goodness you best believe people who are ordering from my shop will get some of these in their orders
i'm so sorry i'm being so annoying saying everything's cute but i mean that's that's what it it's just that is so nice
it's more organized storage whereas the other ones just kind of came in a bag loose and then i guess the pen is inside here
it is as you saw super tiny very light super compact and i would say that i am not a drawing tablet expert
and i'm just testing out the uh variances in the line weight the line width with the pressure sensitivity and honestly for such an uh affordable drawing tablet
i would say that this tablet would be suitable for maybe a very young budding artist that is interested in getting started really early in digital drawing
i am customizing the keys to the shortcuts that i think i would probably want to use the most and something that is i guess worth mentioning
it just felt so much smoother and that the pen really kind of glided across the surface really nicely and so obviously
i just didn't bother to try it out but yeah i actually really really like this cover and something that i was surprised by is
just do a fun little drawing as a more interesting demo for you guys as opposed to just squiggly lines and so yeah
i am mapping out a figure here and this is kind of the way that i like to draw my figures
ready to go for keys that i find are a little bit harder to reach on my keyboard so yeah overall
so if you're someone who has who has drawing tablets already or you have a lot of experience with drawing digitally
this felt like a huge upgrade mostly because of the size and just the the newness and the smooth feel of the drawing experience but seriously i
but i do think that it probably would be beneficial uh for other people to have different inclines on the tilt
and so there's just tiny little learning curves there but overall i felt like this was a really great experience to use
i really think that a graphics tablet has a lot of benefits because you are plugging it into your computer and so you can use any program
artistic needs all right so in conclusion i would say that the first tablet that we looked at the star g640
maybe someone who needs to just have a tablet to write you know signs signatures for contracts or to grade papers digitally
i'm not a teacher so i don't know where we're at in the landscape of teaching and grading but that might be really useful
i think it would be great for students because you can travel around with it from place to place things like that so i would say
i would say that this one i think is a great drawing tablet for someone who is kind of starting out interested in the medium
sort of like a Wacom Cintiq or mobile studio pro that sort of thing and we're gonna review it in this video so check it out
I'm used to carrying my iPad pro around so this feels big to begin with but I'll be comparing it trying it with Photoshop
but which kind of comparing it to the Wacom products because it's more in line with that but I'll just give you my impressions about how it works too
Adobe RGB color spectrum the display can show and to give you a comparison point here the Wacom Cintiq 16 inch the Cintiq
Pro has 85% of the Adobe RGB coverage and this 175 so the color reproduction is not going to be quite as high
I'm going to be editing out a lot of noise in this video okay so I've arranged everything on the little styrofoam think you guys can see
you want to feel like a real digital artist flash this around and press some people maybe maybe nine paper work there is a USB extension
that's all that is and then the pin and there's a little stand stands very very heavy for its size or you also get a little claw thing
the pin feels remarkably like the pin from the last welcome mobile studio pro that i had very similar to that similar
wait two buttons on the pin on the stylus and i don't know we'll see how that feels like all on the screen
it has some rubberized stuff on the back to kind of keep it from sliding around which is nice on this side
so i've come across my first snag which i guess not everybody will would deal with but in the box all right
and here's what happened so I made contact with my representative there at X P pin and I need an adapter so I ordered the adapter
actually guys can see but basically it requires an HDMI and a regular USB and a USB C and I only have USB C on my macbook
I'm coming from an iPad pro which has next to zero parallax as far as like the the distance between the the stylus
and where you're drawing and this one has a few millimeters there which didn't take too long to get used to
there's there's definitely an obvious difference between the the picture quality and I can see this in the text more than anything else
Reds weird in a lot of ways it seems like so keep that in mind but again I don't know how big of a deal that is
I've spent about 30 minutes 45 minutes with this thing over the last a little bit working on that piece and I'm really impressed
Amazon right now and I think that's the regular price you could buy four of these for the price of a like a Wacom Cintiq pro 16
just my honest opinion there are they did ask me to link to their store in the description which I will do because I am unimpressed
with the tablet and I guess I expected especially coming from an iPad pro welcome mobile studio pro in the past
feel big to me relative to the iPad but anything would be big compared to the iPad I would say this is a great tablet for beginners
so there's a few less less colors in that and this monitor covers 75% of that okay while I was editing
don't buy because of that because as I showed the pictures earlier then I don't know and I'll pull them up while I'm talking about this now
you can't beat the price good beginner tablet just for for the same reason for the price and just the the quality of it and and like
I think part of the reason that I made that I noticed that so much is I'm kind of a junkie
I did calibrate it at one point with the software that's built in and it seemed to work fine it seemed to work better after
trying to put the cursor on this spot well if I'm standing here and do it and then I do it over here
that you're not like shifting your head around while you're doing it calibrating helped with the parallax and then the other thing which is again
there's there's two buttons on it and one of them will like toggle between pin pin and eraser and there was a couple of times where
I knew it was something in the software because it was it was working in other other apps but so anyway keep that in mind
it's a great tablet for the price especially compared to your iPad pros and your Wacom mobile studio pros and Cintiq so all of those
hits it's in the it's been a week since that last video but the this tablet was given to me to review
I don't get a dime okay so I actually am whether you purchase it or not doesn't have any bearing on me financially so anyway
hi there it's Dave alte Villa for hot hardware and this is the Asus Transformer book t100 ta the T 100 ta is a 10.1 inch Windows
L SOC with integrated Intel HD graphics 2 gig of ram 32 or 64 gig of on-board storage with the tablet
you also get a micro USB power cable and AC adapter and the system retails at 349 for the 32 gig version and 399 for the 64 gig model
the t100 tas 10.1 inch display has a native resolution of 1366 by 768 it's an IPS display with full multi-touch and gesture control capabilities
you'll find the dock mount sockets for the keyboard dock as well as the keyboard connector port on the left edge
switching / a start menu button on the top left edge is where the power button is on the right edge
I've downloaded the game six-gun from the Windows Store and though controlling a first-person shooter with glass in touch isn't the most convenient way you can see
you can connect a wireless USB game controller to the device or use a mouse with your keyboard which is our recommendation for this game genre
i'm gonna be making a separate post about this since this is gonna be a little contest so stay tuned for that my instagram followers
of course we need to download the driver so i went to artisol.com downloads and download the driver and begin to set things up now about the shortcut
you can only customize seven of them because one is actually a switch for the light it really has a nice ring to the tablet
although i'm sure you already know who she is well before i say my thoughts about this tablet enjoy the speed paint first forever forever
don't worry if you've reached the end of this video and don't forget to subscribe and turn that bell on ring
I cover all things geek design Photoshop photography and more with Howard Pinsky from ice-floe studios and new episodes come out every Friday
I'm not even going to talk about the insane pressure sensitivity all the specs the multi-touch features the customizable keys and touch
I'm gonna give it about a two on a scale of one to ten the mouse on the other hand sits in your hand
I can't retouch or use my pencil in Photoshop and that hurts so I'm only going to give it a four
the mouse has a sweet laser and left and right click buttons not much going on here for this one so
I mean I'll give it a three the Wacom we've got multi-touch pinch and zoom and finger roll to rotate your Photoshop
document the full power of opacity and flow behind thousands literally thousands of Photoshop brush options and quick buttons to modify any of those options in seconds
so it feels pretty natural to me not really for sketching or retouching though at a high level but it is usable
there's a learning curve that ranges from a few hours to a few weeks so that hurts this a little but once you get it down
the pencil and paper is like 5 bucks so I'm going to give that a brilliant 10 out of 10 right there and a mouse
so after seeing how everything graded out in my experience picking up a tablet was essentially a no-brainer and shortly after
I work and I hope it does the same for you if you go out and pick one up so please leave a comment below
comments are always great as well and if you liked the video feel free to share it with your friends so Wacom or not
you plug them into the cable so you can use the drawing tablet not only for computers but for android devices as well
and some buttons you can customize them in the huion driver also in the box there is actually a smudge guard the glove what it is
so i plugged into a cable with an adapter into my android device and i went to a drawing program called sketchpad
what makes this tablet special is that it has a second side you can actually draw on it on it and make amazing artworks
and i 100 would recommend it to you who are starting out and if you enjoyed this video considering liking the video and subscribing thanks i appreciate it anyway
let's take a look so Sony wasn't kidding about this thing's waistline if you take a look it's actually about 6.35 millimeters thick which is absolutely staggering
it is a 10.1 inch screen that runs at 1920 by 1200 so honestly it's not the most pixel dense thing you're going to see out there
so honestly there isn't a whole lot that you could let this thing that it's not going to be able to handle
we do have a movies hub and does display your own your own videos as well a quick swipe up here obviously brings you to the store
Sony has done a pretty fine job of covering up Android hero a lot of us are fans of stock Android
but if you had to go if you absolutely had to go with a overlay that sits on top of it
people actually use tablets to take photos and thankfully sony has kitted out the z2 tablet with a pair of pretty good ones
now that's going to include Wi-Fi surfing on the internet as well as pretty good a video as well but easily my favorite thing about this
I can't guarantee you're going to get updates with this but otherwise it runs really really well in terms of price and what you get
the display is 1080p 1920 by 1080 and it's an IPS display so no matter what angle you're looking at it
they're not gonna you know affect that you don't change too much and you'll be able to see it pretty much like
now let's check out some things on here so first of all you might want to know you know since it's 130 hundred and forty five bucks
it's gonna run it kind of badly but it ran just fine when I was doing like the initial test on this with this game
I did have the game open before this and when I reopened it they had closed up so it doesn't have a ton of RAM at only 2 gigabytes
you'll put the aged pop that off and put in the micro SD card in there and then other than that
it wasn't that long ago and this one got 145 which is not as fast but this is also a 140 dollar tablet versus a over $1000 phone
currently well if they guess they have the 855 plus but the 855 on here and this also has 12 gigabytes of RAM
but and we obviously when you can you compare that to my galaxy phone which got a score of 7 16 and 25 71
it also has bluetooth so if you want to plug in Bluetooth headphones you can with it so you know again
I mean you know you could do video chat on here but I don't think you're gonna wanna I'll sorry to show you how the camera looks
Here I am right here but I mean who takes pictures with tablets anyway it looks like I have my in my other camera my other light up
you can select what you want to do it to mute it or do nothing or turn it on to vibrate
you can see a lot of this stuff doesn't stay put it kind of reloads it just because of the low
I'll kind of dive right into a sample vid where I'll be using it in Photoshop and let you know how it performs and then the end
USB to USB cord so you can use this to charge as well as if you don't have access to Bluetooth capability and you wanted
use this pen tablet as a while your device you can with this given cord does come with the standard rip pen and as you can see
scroll button that adjusts the various options for how this school rule can perform where it be for zooming for adjusting your brush size etc right here
alright guys this is the kind of sample or testing portion of the n toes for Bluetooth wireless pen tablet review
I've got the standard hotkey set up display toggle movement of both the screen etc right and zoom in if possible
sighs we're going to increase it a little bit bigger you can do see or it's a little bit wider kind of like that neon
really allow you that the faint markings order to really adjust that pressure that you're putting on it to create various effects shadows
I thought about the product after the weeks of testing that I went through with using this tested the various pen grips
what you will want to notice is make sure that if you do not intend to use this for longer periods of time to remember to shut it off
I have heard reports that if you leave this running does go into a self shut off mode but as it drains
I use this for all my photoshop work now any of the design work that I do even general day-to-day tasks
and now the case has been installed so as you can see alignment is really good no issues whatsoever you can fully press the
um let's go ahead and just get into it and then i'll go charge it and do a couple tests but let's see
here's the remarkable two and then i can bring in one of my bigger devices just so you can kind of see
but let's go ahead what i'm going to do is i'm going to fire this up because everybody wants to see this
i have the brightness pretty high so if i come over here to brightness and i go ahead and bring this all the way up you can see
i think if we use the remarkable is a little bit better um it feels a little bit better on the device
it's not great it's just okay and i don't like the nib or the stylus that comes with it now to change colors
now that you're going to watch video here but i'm going on a2 which is going to be more ghosting right and i'm gonna play this video for you
let's go into the app so the two things i want to look at was the color to see if it did anything for me
and then the um and then the other you know the writing experience the writing experience is okay but the color doesn't do much for me
it's just not that fantastic and then i got to put a screensaver on it and again i bought this device so there you go
i i think we're still a little ways away from the note-taking app that's going to do everything for you and different colors again
i've got a little bit of ghosting there so if i want to go gray you know it's it's okay again
this is a community more than a channel as i always say let me down below and know down below you
the pen is $30 extra and they go with that little red cap to remind you of the erasers tick pointer that's used on
tablet cameras are generally not so amazingly good 10.1 inch IPS display standard resolution 1280 by 800 and like most all honeycomb tablets it's powered by a 1 gigahertz
there was just so much third-party software on there that actually slowed it down and made it a little less stable
HD video in terms of frame rates by the way got shortcuts reading here at Kindle is preloaded on this OHS Enya music player
if you use a third-party file manager you can get access to the files and files do show up in gallery
we're looking at internal storage by default and if we tap little USB drive button on screen we'll see the USB Drive files over here
we've got a queue weather we've got Amazon Kindle we've got Amazon mp3 store we've got lenovo's App Store show you in a minute citrix for your business types
we've got something called ereader which is pretty much the same one that we saw in the IdeaPad k1u you can sign logbooks
it's okay so great we've got poke talk booboo for video chat course you can use google talk video chat as well
which is also 1.6 but just to note that it's not a light tablet compared to the Lenovo IdeaPad k1 here and you can see
plastic 'back simulate the transformer rather than having a nice thing pad looking bad and now we'll compare it to the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1
but what do you lose at the galaxy's have a whole lot of ports since this is a business-oriented tablet it also comes with an office
the bad thing is there goes access to USB port once you've plugged it in here and you've got a really good you know
so you can see her side by side we've got a little bit more height on the Lenovo ThinkPad keyboard and that does help a key
do a sense display as well with the capacitive touch and an active pen though and it was not as insensitive as this can be sometimes
the standard keyboard here knows also as an XT 9 keyboard so we'll visit our website so let's quickly enough over Wi-Fi again no 3G option yet
the thing padded and not so much it works in notes mobile and it works in some third-party applications like we've got a new sketchbook
but they that's about as good as it was doing if you just want to write ink notes and keep them as ink notes you tap here and there
so this is a legacy enabled device so if it old sound editors video editors this device will be great for you
it's a you know it's it's the the build quality it's not up there with the likes of like a discount
Dell 2 + 1 or even like a HP laptop for example it's you know it's an RCA device so that it's the lowest common denominator of parts
it's not glass performance-wise though it's great for an RCA device as sports an intel atom z3580 gigs of ram this is an improvement upon devices
like the HP stream 7 the Dell Venue 8 Pro those only ship with one gig of ram at least the previous models
I've got this is the good thing about this device so I mean if you just you need something real cheap
it's the same specs as you see on like the Intel and you see it's the write the computer on a stick
it's the same system on a chip so luckily in the Microsoft space Intel seems to be the only player on the on
I mean you know you don't get a glass screen on a laptop so you can take it or leave it
Wi-Fi you got the b/g/n Wi-Fi it's just single channel Wi-Fi you can't you don't get the 5 gigahertz range or anything
this is really something that you're gonna want to have a docking station for somewhere where you can just plug it in and use it
I'd see the day on our RCA device that says Intel Inside on it but this device is about to be returned
I paid a hundred and twenty dollars for this Dell laptop and I will be doing a review on that if you're looking for just a low-end computing device
so the good people at huion once again decide to send me another tablet review and the wise person once said you can never have enough tablets
so i'm sure i'm gonna struggle putting it into use later and of course the tablet okay so like it has a protective uh plastic around it
yes i happen to be more obsessed with pokemon than donuts which also has replacement names never have enough of those cables and you have other cable eyes
walking on a tablet this big it takes up a lot of space on my desk and it's hard to walk around it that's just a personal preference though
something that makes the tablet stand out a lot amongst others is the fact that it has so many connection options
and mac os compatible the full lamination screen is 150 slgb color gamut and has a 1920 over 1080 display resolution with a 178 wide viewing angle
i'm not used to walking with a glove at all and now problem the first it doesn't have shortcut buttons every tablet
this only works if you use one or two express keys really otherwise you should probably look for a different model problem
the second the screen is super bright so bright in fact it actually hurts my eyes to look at it for too long
i don't know if my eyes are too sensitive or something but i had to lower the brightness by at least half
this video may be a bit long so if you want to save time you can check out the text review that I have already written on my blog
Pablo products I invite you to share with other viewers your user experience in the comment section below this is the Quick Start Guide
it feels really nice to draw on and this is how it sounds and now let's see what the driver can do this is
two point one point five the functionality of Windows and Mac drivers they are essentially the same except for Windows there
that's great if you are using 16 by 9 you may want to reduce this lightly to match the aspect ratio of your desktop
if you are left-handed you can choose the option here and this is where you can assign specific keyboard shortcuts to those express keys
five functions and switch monitor is useful when you are using more than one monitor for the scroll wheel or the dog you can assign up to five functions
Windows I just want to let you see the lack so the line actually trails behind a cursor by quite a bit and the animation of the line appearing
Windows ink to get pressure sensitivity working other than Photoshop on Windows which is less responsive or the other drawing apps that I have tested
so this means you can tilt your pen while you are drawing but this does not mean that it has to sensitivity or maybe
it actually shows the cursor but it's too small for you to see now it doesn't make sense to use this tablet with the tap
it's still in vertical portrait orientation obviously when this is in portrait orientation you draw something and this is in landscape
hey everybody it's lavender town and today i'm going to be making a beginner's guide to digital drawing tablets as well as unboxing and reviewing a few new tablets
so if you like to travel a lot with your drawing supplies it's not a bad idea to try one of these out
they're also good if you have a clunkier or older pc since they're less demanding on your computer overall the other main type of tablet is the screen tablet
i set the one closest to my hand to undo since i use it so frequently the one above that is the eyedropper tool to pick up colors
usually they have like a lefty and a ready mode not the ability to change it in any direction like that another thing
you should consider when you're getting used to your tablet for the first time is making sure that you're getting into good habits with your posture
i recommend getting a stand for your tablet if it does not come with one this one did but a lot of screen tablets
some people hold the tablets in their lap and that can be okay too but it can also kind of cause your spine to be like curving around it
um that's something that when i was younger i wasn't that careful with and i was pretty hard on my tablets
i've always wanted a mechanical wheel on a screen tablet and this one has one as well as a touch wheel in the center
you really need something to hold it up at a comfortable viewing and drawing distance for you and a lot of other companies
i've noticed um try to sort of nickel and dime you by getting you to buy those things separately but with this one it just comes straight with it
thank you to all of my patrons including razer 57 zephyr art place aubry schmidt lululuna rusu lilly ler hazel tiffia elizabeth ward the expressive poker face
Tabler is a mid-range tablet so we can purchase this for around 100 250 pounds but I does have a lot of features booing
if there has a display sound storage is a 16 gig and billing BIOS Lee after everything all the software updates anything you you will have around
I wouldn't say it's the best part for a 10 inch tablet it does would lost your Lisa holding of you know constant news youth spa around 8 hours
I do highly recommend that it's affordable it has the quality and all I would recommend is by agonised a tempered screen and protector
however the last xp pen tablet that i reviewed was really good and so i kind of wanted to test this one out personally so with that
uh it has eight express keys and the dial is actually a dual dial so it's like having two dials in one
that's pre-installed so there's no air bubbles which i greatly appreciate because putting those things on yourself is very very annoying
i do also really wish that their stands were adjustable because they're always a fixed width and they always felt a little shallow to me
so for the overall build quality i would probably give this about a four out of five just because of these few small issues for me
the biggest drawback is that the stand isn't adjustable though if you're left-handed again that could cause issues if you plan to use the express keys at all now
not needing to mess with the on-screen display to calibrate my color settings is such a blessing as with the previous model the pen accuracy is also very tight
and i've never had any issue with them before they're easy to adjust and edit easy to set up express keys etc
when you would want to get this would kind of depend on where you're at if you're already using a solid tablet
this isn't going to be a significant upgrade however if you're using a very baseline tablet and you're looking to upgrade to a significant one
or if you're looking for a first time tablet this is also a great one overall if this is within your budget i totally recommend this tablet
i haven't had too much new to share as of late because i've been busy with contract work and freelance work
haikyuu tablet that we got from my daughter my last review was on the PBS tablet that was super glitchy so we ended up returning it to Walmart
that one was $80 and this one was about 130 so it was $50 more but it wasn't glitchy or anything compared to that one as you can see
it's pretty much like a regular tablet just with a little protection barrier around it it has a better battery life than PBS tablet
is that it cost $50 more and the Konomi app that it talks about and for its learning is a subscription app
nice feeling tablet feels sturdy feels like quality also very thin at a third of an inch quite light and we have these funny little teeny
the 7 inch tablet is just maybe a little bit too small here we have the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 plus
so you can see the difference and if you find web page text a little too small something like that for the 10 inch tablet
but it's definitely legible and considering the fact there are some 7-inch tablets that are supporting this resolution and it's not too bad
LT or not believe or not LT you can use more battery power than Wi-Fi but the xiphoid 10.1 has a 7 thousand milliamp battery which is absolutely humongous
Motorola right now is discounting their original really lovely Bluetooth keyboard visit come out with a new version with an integrated trackpad
and they throw in the mouse for free - and now while we're here we've also got a 1080p high profile trailer loaded mpeg-4 format h.264
HDMI port so you can help with this to a big screen to your HDTV even to an HDMI compatible projector in terms of synthetic benchmarks is iboard
Verizon services available if you happen to go out of an LTE coverage area does have 3G EVDO Rev a as well again this insult in Verizon stories
are you going to be getting it from Verizon because it does have their wireless radios inside well we see a Wi-Fi only version like Europe
it has a significantly larger battery and it manages about 8 hours for us versus the 5 to 6 hours for the smaller
the 10.1 has a lot of business oriented applications it's got Citrix it's got GoToMeeting it's got a virtual Polycom ulcers and stuff like that
Word documents PDFs all that kind of stuff and you can do a wirelessly which is pretty handy if you do plug this in via USB
that's not copy protected and your iTunes library can be synced with the tableau you can also install rosen's V CAST media manager
but that's up to you and you can also sync to Windows Media Player by the way under windows in terms of other software
that's loaded on here not too much below where we've got blockbuster rise and likes to include it we have Madden NFL 12
Netflix flicks is also preloaded on this for those you have Netflix accounts and got the ever capable YouTube streaming app on here
Plus this doesn't full W flash as well but the honeycomb version of the YouTube player is actually pretty awesome very high quality in a very nice presentation
we have living room and you can add any other room that you want and you can control your AV gear up here
if you go back to the guide if you want to get description of something that's wrong you can tap it if you had the watch button
these guys usually spend a lot of time on the coffee table in front of the couch with you probably at night
second lightning fast probably know some improvement in perceived performance with Ice Cream Sandwich so that's the Motorola's eye board 8.2 it's available now on
I'd really like to thank you on for reaching out and offering me such a cool opportunity to work with a brand that I actually use myself
you can use the little thingy didn't observe them when your point gets a little dull after some awesome time in my own
this tablet has a neat little feature where you can write and draw on the back of it on some edges sketch type
I kind of don't believe that and I kind of hate it except for when I don't but I'm sure a lot of artists can relate there
so if they're watching film or youtube etc they don't have to hold it you can just put it on the table and watch it that way
and it also comes with a micro usb charging cable it also comes with a mains plug here and a user manual here as well
that's about it so it's not really that much if it was adult use then um that much memory wouldn't be enough now also it
you're in charge of the password control screen time limit and kid family control and it also has the kids mode as well ui so you have
it goes from $20 to $30 right now and it also has a very cute seafoam green kind of teal design and white accents
which you don't usually see it also comes with the drivers on a disc and a cord to plug it in
I'd give it a four out of five because I do think that $20 is a good price for a functioning drawing tablet though
the pen pressure is fantastic for that price point and it has lasted me many years without giving me any trouble for the design
I'd probably give it a 4 out of 5 mainly just because I think that the new colors are using as accents are much cuter and I really wish
it was $300 when my family first got it for me but now the price that you can get it for it varies
I think the value is a four out of five as it is now because I think that's a little steep for something that is used
II loop at the top that the bamboo used to have as well as four little clicky buttons and I was surprised to see that
that started blinking right away when I took it out of the package because I didn't realize that this was a bluetooth tablet
Wacom also sent me this one and so I also waited to unbox it until I could make this video now
Pro is there's a lot of pieces that are metal or that just feel more sturdy and heavy than other tablet type things that I've used for example
I couldn't bring myself to do it now for the most expensive one of the bunch this is the Wacom Cintiq companion 2
you can draw on them and you don't even need a computer to hook them up to because they're their own tiny computer when it was brand new
it's awesome because it's kind of like having a digital sketchbook however there are a few things I wish they would change
I'd give the design a 4 out of 5 taking up a point for that upside down camera and I'd give the feel a 5 five
I thought that the pen pressure was actually pretty good and the size is perfectly acceptable but I do remember that
if you're gonna buy a tablet soon you do your research and carefully consider it because a good tablet can change your life in a bad tablet
I've had a few viewers leave some comments and I want to try to do my best to cover or to answer
go back if you you have to go back and watch that first video but it comes with the front facing dual facing cameras
I'm going to say and though in the first review I felt like you know I really wasn't talking bad about the tablet per se
do not think that you are going to be getting a very high end device such as I say Nexus devices Samsung devices
but it is a really good budget tablet for the ones that are being offered nowadays they also had said to that same
Bureau had said that that most of the apps are they had not had a problem with any of the apps
get my app drawer open on the Google Play Store now and guys girls guys this also comes with the Google Play Store installed on it
I also had a viewer respond the back on this device if I can get it picked up its slick is very thin
they had seven-inch device they had claimed and said that the the back on that device was thin it is also sort of thin on the eight inch device
if you put any kind of pressure on the back end of the device you will see the protrusion or whatever come through the screen and because
I don't believe I believe that's everything that I that all the any amount any of the viewers that left comments on
I believe that everything but as far as a budget tablet it really it takes the lead in any of the budget tablets that are being offered today
we got two of these tablets for each of my girls so one of them is six and the other one is four
the price point for the amazon fire is much more reasonable uh than an ipad which is like well over 500 pounds
i think i haven't bought a new ipad for quite a while but i think around 500 pounds so this is much better
we bought it around christmas time when there was a sale on for the tablet so we got ours in a sale
you log it into your home wi-fi system you follow a series of steps which basically takes less than 10 minutes
and this that you can see here is what i'm talking about when i say amazon kids plus so the content you've got here is games apps
oh it's just like a grown-up tablet but there's ultimate parental control because you know when they're in this profile they can't get on anything else
they can't go on the internet and search for stuff they can't start setting up facebook profiles although thank god like with a four and six year old
which is something i find reassuring but the good thing about this tablet as well is that i'm just going to switch it to my mode now
i won't show you my pin so when i take it to my profile um and obviously the tablet knows i am the
it's just a normal tablet so you can get books um kindles on there amazon music normal web browsing so i can browse anything
but you know that when you present it to a young child you can quite easily go to the drop down menu click profiles
this is like the first time they've discovered like youtube videos and they have become so hooked with watching like unboxing videos and other kids baking again
this is a highly filtered youtube that is only age appropriate for your kids and audible um content as well so audiobooks so they can look at things there
they can look at their recent content that they've recently been playing with their favorites or they can browse things by characters and themes which is really cool
oh you see my light there so just a few words on size and so this is the amazon fire eight
um you've got like these holes here um there's various bits where your kid can like really get a grip on it
um and then it also has a little socket there for the plugs to go in so that you can charge it charging
so when your child taps on a video or in a game or something it downloads it rather than it being a streaming process
but what the amazon tablet does is gives you complete control from your phone so i know exactly how long they've been on the tablet
um when they're going to bed uh so i already vagued you know how long they're gonna be but i can see broken down
and if i have any concern about that if i think i would rather they were spending more time reading books than doing these games
so i can go into settings and i can pause the device completely in settings so i can shut it down
that's great but i'd really really like to limit the games in the youtube and whatever you can do that from here okay guys
Buy you know just kind of looking around at some things I can get for cheap and it just so happens
Logitech HD camera does have stereo speakers 6800 milliamp hour lithium-ion up to six hours video playback 3.5 millimeter stereo headphone jack
we don't need instructions and of course right off the bat and didn't throw this thing we have the Insignia flex tablet brand spankin
good sized tablet not a huge fan of the backing on here it looks like a scratched match surface but feels a little cheap if
we've got other ports here for audio and get your volume rocker here and you got your power button so to go ahead and set that aside here
yeah so we're gonna go ahead and get this guy charged up and we're gonna see what she can do so
this is only a 10-inch tablet with a matching keyboard and as you can see after our test a touchpad got in the way quite frequently
I'm judging you or anything overall the Insignia 10 inch flex tablet is not a bad system but the lack of any storage outside at 32 gigabytes
hello everyone this is the ico d50 tablet which i got from these extreme calm possess dx.com for short and this is the tablet
let's take a look at the specifications and we have the android version 4.0 for installed this is the t-50 model
now let's take a look at storage by donald storage is around 1 gigabytes and we have another storage which is around 5.2 3 gigabytes
I highly recommend this device if you are not willing to spend a lot on your Android and a device as this device works ok for the price
I don't know but is there the speaker's like I said are front-facing so it is good they are a bit tinny in my opinion
I've heard better from other tablets but the front-facing does make it good with the stereo speakers it's on Android 7l Box
it does come with various pre-loaded things including all Microsoft Office suite but you can only install almost everything apart from these two things easy
it's not soft touch which have been used on all the other tablets but this is a bit grip here so
if there's any apps you want me to randomly test on it any games or anything like that just leave us a shout in the comments bug
I'm Nathan with the e-book reader comm for this video I'm going to give you guys a review of the Lenovo tab 210 tablet
it's actually cheaper than amazon's tablet and it has a higher resolution screen and a few other upgrades like twice as much
RAM so let me go ahead and talk about some of the features versus kind of show the outside of this device first
I mean there's some out there like over 300 okay so when it comes to software this tablet runs Android 5.0 lollipop
another thing is like if you have it turned off you have all these different commands so if you want to draw a W on there
I don't have an SD card installed right now but if you do have one installed you do have the option to put stuff on the SD card
Sepik okay so you can go in and adjust the speed as well if you wanted it to read louder or faster some different accessibility options in here
they have this somewhere another so inverse the colors a system-wide so everything's opposite all right so I'm running the benchmark right now for those of you
so you gotta kind of wipe it off a little bit more often but I mean that's not really a big deal
this came with the tablet so it must be sort of their promotion this year or something but so you can get this video if you want
PDF to do layout a little bit bigger natively when you're using a portrait mode like this so obviously it looks okay on this
I mean I was just sort of Android but it's nothing like the boggy nough so I've had on past Android tablets
well it holds it nicely in and even puts it at the proper angle so if I'm sitting downstairs I'm doing some laundry or something
I'm gonna go ahead and show you the Box real quick just to go over a few of the features of this particular tablet once
can't you see it's an Acer Iconia 1/8 and if my camera will focus here you guys can see that a little bit better there we go
I must say they're nothing that I would absolutely never use unless I absolutely had to so just a fair warning to you guys
I can get 2 days use out of this without having to charge the battery and last not least it does have 802 11 a BGN and Bluetooth 4.0
Acer directly don't go to the manufacturer or the go the manufacturer don't go to the place where you purchased in this keep my case would be
so let's go ahead and take a look at the tablet itself on the front here like so you got that 8 inch
I don't have to push hard so you're not going to have to worry about breaking the screen or anything like that once again
it does have some nice features on it it when you has the pull down menu which basically gives you all your notifications here which
I mean it is perfectly fine all right every I have cpu-z open and this gives you a little bit better idea of the hardware in here
you guys can pause the video if you want to read that more if I go to the battery you can see the voltage on
just giving you the different temperatures and of course let me push away here because it's gonna go ahead and open an ad again
I said it is considered to be a bare-bones tablet but it's more than capable for doing normal tasks unless you're a high end gamer
it's going to do pretty much everything you ask of it - if you need something to take pictures with like
I said the cameras not that great on here but at least in my case I really never use a tablet for photography
I really hope you guys are enjoying these please remember to Like and subscribe and as always have a blessed day everybody
I'm Dazza and today I'm going to be doing a video review of the huion GT 220 interactive pen displayed tablet over the years
I want to take you through my use and setup experience from the very beginning which started at the arrival of the package
and everything you need to get started so I was fine to set up and just get going from the get-go the driver was provided on a DVD and
I wasn't sure if I'd hit a roadblock because to be honest my computer doesn't have a disk drive because you know
the pen comes with a USB cable to recharge which can plug into the computer or into a standard USB wall socket converter
I didn't actually use the pen for over 800 hours before making this review so I can't say that I had any problems with the charge running out yet
the space of 48 hours can get a pretty clear gist of how a device functions and how it complements your workflow in the past
I can say is having used this device in particular and in the time that I used it it has felt good quality and enjoyable to use
I would absolutely recommend this device especially for beginners wanting to move into that intermediate level and stretch their wings without breaking their budget
the device looks very appealing just on the desk and in a normal workspace and would be a great visual addition to any home studio or work setup
make sure to check out the link in the description with the coupon code that is displayed down there as well again
thank you so much for watching once again go to Huron comm for more details but as for this video itself
leave them in the comment section below and also while you're there make sure to leave your suggestions or requests for any product
join the creative cloud today and get loads of incredible creative tools like Photoshop anime Premiere Pro and other apps for your computer or mobile device
it came with a bunch of pre-loaded videos here and luckily my kids you know if they were sitting around like watching this all the time
as far as you know like obviously obviously it was gonna be like a painting thing she just loves to mash this keyboard
you know it's maybe on the lower quality you know as far as the tablets would go but you know again you know it
she likes the she'll watch this but yeah that's pretty much it it's supposed to come with so that's the operating system seven-inch display Wi-Fi
I'll let you know how the LeapPad is but if you're looking for something to entertain your kids and you're looking through all the tablets on Amazon
a little bit about the specifications of it it has two gigabytes of ram and 32 gigabytes of storage it has a 1280 by 800 resolution ips display
it asked me for my um google login and i logged in using that and it said hey we found a backup from your other tablet
everything's installed it just took you know i don't know a half hour or so wasn't really a big deal for any of that so now
let's try some video playback so let me get a video cued up and i'll show you what that looks like all right
video quality is very good all around just in general it appears to be a pretty good unit with no complaints at all whatsoever
so if you're familiar with that then it's you know really second nature to you if you already have a tablet or something or a phone that runs android
that's all right there for you as well so you can just install you know pretty much any app you want and all around
they are just an everyday thing now and they just need to be there to get the job done and like i said this is adequate
it does a fine job and as i had stated earlier i would have absolutely no problem using this as my everyday tablet
I'm taking a look at the all-new smart tab Disney seven inch high-definition kids learning tablet which I have to say I've been really impressed with now
sound output and you can see that right now on my little demo here of a short piece of a music file now speaking of music files
this thing is actually capable of playing 9 different audio file types including NP 2's mp3s WAV files and many other popular types
so if you have a car cigarette lighter adapter with USB input you can easily charge the smart tab on the go
which are arcade read and learn and a video section that allows your child to watch special kids videos on YouTube
that'll play a brief clip up right now spider-man by Tomas Macri illustrated by Todd knock and hi-fi design based on the Marvel comic book series the amazing spider-man
in addition to the three main child mode sections there is also a lot of other apps and programs that your child can make use of examples
include a handy calculator so that they can check that their math homework is correct and this fun little drawing program that
it gives you lots of different drawing and painting implements to choose from and it also gives you plenty of color options
I did kind of find it difficult drawing with just my finger though and kind of wished at times that they had included a stylus with this in fact
you actually have to protect the battle files in the center of the screen by pressing on and popping the frogs before they can
it's really quite a lot of fun and also educational and I even think that some adults may find it fun for them to use as well
I love to draw digital art and I want to give this bad boy a review so in Melonie Mac fashion
this looks like the drivers and we've also got this pin pin holder thing a little mouse so as within the box
I have the genius tablet right here and I'm just gonna say on my lap here cuz it's more convenient for me
I just have to be really honest like I don't like it and I think that like I'm just used to Wacom tablets they're great
I don't I really sorry and yeah I can't I can't even hardly draw it we're just bad but I swear I'm not a bad artist
I feel absolutely terrible because I hate to talk bad about a product but I don't so my suggestion to you guys is invested in Wacom
I'll also have an annotation here and a link in the description you know just so you can revisit some of my drawings cuz
front and rear 2 megapixel camera quad-core cpu running android 10.0 with the solid state memory of 32 gigabytes with the micro sd card slot support
you have a 2 megapixel camera without any flashlight with a manufacturer logo in the middle and the back of the tablet is also a matte
first time is easy and straight forward just simply power it up and follow whatever is appear up on your screen first
if you want to now inside the tablet they also have a fm radio as well but for that to work in
but if you're thinking of using this tablet for the zoom meetings and anything like that like skype calls it would be ideal now
you're going to have an access for your network and internet connections connected devices in terms of bluetooth connectivity app and notification battery life status display control
the obvious part which you're going to need is basically a internet connection where you can use your mobile phone hotspot here
that what i think about this tablet honestly speaking from the performance point of view what you are paying for that you are getting it as well
it's not really a bad tablet at all serves its purpose and i would highly recommend for the kids actually which are in age of four to eight
I'm going to talk about my experience using the tablet and hopefully if this is the device that's interesting to you
so if you're interested in grabbing this tablet they have been kind enough to give you a discount which is fantastic five percent off of the gt2 21
Huy on our goal is for you to be 100% happy with your new huion product if you need any assistance please don't hesitate to contact us something
I never used a two-finger one as well feels finger e it sounds weird sorry and then of course inside the rest of the box
we have the tablet itself packaged all nice and snug in here shall we unveil it and here we have it the 221
wow this is um this is bigger than unexpected this is definitely bigger than the 220 and some of the obvious changes and additions with the 221
I'm looking forward to trying out some spare nibs and a nib removal ring for when your nibs run down which
I saw the the pen saw thing but I thought because this was the pen pen but this is something else
ready to take with you and if you wanted to travel with this thing you could fold it up wrap it throw it in a backpack or a suitcase
I don't know if you're staying at someone else's house I don't know I just invented a use for my second pen because I got a free second pen
it's time to install the drivers now it does of course come with a driver disk but my laptop doesn't even have a disk drive
what do you do when you can't use the DVD or CD provided you snap the CD and then regret it
so as you watch this video you'll see me go through creating this illustration of a lady looking at you with the hungry
the first thing that came to mind which is apparently a seductive woman anyways as you see me going through this painting process
on both sides of the device enabling you to create some customized handy and quick macros and actions in your digital art workflow
the device features an adjustable stand which is similar to the one on the 220 v2 but to be honest on the 220
I talk about how it was to use and I'll start off with a couple of things that I feel could have definitely been improved
is that in the very bottom left corner there was just a slight loss of sensitivity on the the pen on the tablet itself
I think when you look at the context of what this device is a professional extremely high pressure sensitivity device for a very reasonable price
I keep winking why do I keep winking indirectly comparing it to the previous model of the tablet that I used
I don't know how the balance is working but it feels much more stable to use and to press off the other obvious
and that is what you want which means that this device is more than capable of producing fantastic professional results even better than what I can do on it
all of the features that we've gone through previously in this video colonnade in a device that is full HD really robust build quality
really nice to use and with fantastic pressure sensitivity all of which in the wonderful package of a very affordable price
you could say that the icing was a little bit messy or could be a little bit neater but the overall experience or the overall cake
tablets are a bit tricky because obviously they come in different shapes and sizes and big tablets are loved by some people
hey who'd have thought you'd get sent a spare pen all of a sudden even that minor inconvenience doesn't exist and the smudge guard is really nice
and the fact that it comes with one again is just fantastic all in all the experience of using the gt2 21
those of you who have professional ease but also people who really want to break into the digital display tablet market

sometimes you don't want a big heavy tablet to walk around so once again guys remember to leave a like on this video
i'm gonna put my password hold on okay so we start out with this and all these apps the google play store google
Gulman this is the m10 6k graphics tablet so this is the tablet that I have already taken up from the box
there are two buttons on this side and this is the tip it moves slightly and this is the charging port behind the pen
it's actually not difficult to use fingers to pull out the nib so you may not even need to use the new remover
here that you can customize to any keyboard shortcuts you want in addition to all these shortcuts there are also 16 soft keys that you can access with pen
since the tablet driver is not included in the box you have to download the driver from their website and our website is gamma on.net
I have a sign mine so this are some of the keys that you can assign they will give you this
drop down menu with all the letters so you have to choose the letters from this drop down menu and these are the control option shift and command checkboxes
let me show you how the strokes taper by the way this is zoom up to 300% so the ages are be pixelated
now the only thing to note is this surface is actually a bit smooth compared to other brands so it feels more slippery
I'm drawing I'm not sure you can see the cursor it leaves a trail of cursor when I'm drawing it doesn't affect drawing which is looks a bit weird
comes up very smooth curves are very smooth there are no angular ages and the taper quite well the transition from thin to thick in terms of pressure sensitivity
if you have any questions let me know in comments section below if I have any dates to this tablet I will put that in my text
sorry for the rough ledge of the microphone but yeah let's move on to the actual video all right first off
I recorded this the moment I got this thing in the mail so this will be kind of a first little impressions as I
up is the holder for the nibs and everything but you can also put the pen itself inside which is really nice
if we open it up here inside they actually put a little handy thing that lets you know how to set it up
the my pinky just doesn't really fit all that great but if you've got smaller hands you should be fine if you have bigger hands
then we have the cables the first one you got is the USB cables which has the red one for power and the regular one for data transfer
I can tell you about the features so the RT LD 13s is a 13-inch display tablet it features a full 1080p
you'll notice the gap between the display and the pen tip however this is not really noticeable while drawing in my experience of course
I think this is a pretty good tablet like I said I have a couple minor gripe that I mentioned before but honestly I think for $300
nowadays so just a little minor gripe but honestly this is still super portable super easy to move around super easy to use so not something
check out other people's reviews see if anyone shares any similar situations to yourself before you make any decision as for me
it's just quicker to make posts but anyway thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you guys in the next video later
this itself is the light pad so it's I just see if I can quickly show you how thin it is very thin
so there's some things that you can place on there for tracing and there's a few pages like this one which
pick your design so what we might do is we might show you how we're going to put a dress on one of these girls so what we do
you can do this as detailed if you just want to use it to get a basic shape and basic outline
I'm going to show you is a mandala so the mandalas you have two different ways of doing it when I do my mandalas
just to use the star but I sorry I extended it out so I got a just a sharpie and just extended my lines
you just placed concentric circles around around the the star itself to help keep myself on track for a mandala so the other thing
lines curved lines and angled line straight lines curved lines and angled lines so a mandala is basically a combination of all those in circles in concentric circles
you can make this as big or as little as you want if you only and you can put it away and come back another day
I'm just going to turn it off and take it away then tomorrow when I come back I just turn my light pad back on
York we can actually put everything that we've just done back in the box including all the paper in our drawings there so the box is hardcover
Stars so I didn't mention that before but we've got lots of things by this branding and it's also all in our Christmas catalogue
automatic brightness is set pretty low that gives you the longer battery life but I like to have the full bright screen
2 with a consistent intro more consistent art style and more consistent backgrounds first i put the storyboard and toon boom harmony
this is the only time i can get to be super creative so i draw a bunch of random stuff and add a lot of details
i currently use photoshop instead of procreate on ipad because of this brush and this tool which still does not exist in procreate
i use dark red or dark blue for my line art and i add a bit of texture and ta-da time for the next step
here's how the pen sounds like without the film and with the film i actually prefer using the film also included in
if you're into calligraphy or digital painting with a pen or the pen holder that houses the nib remover and more nibs
that looks good enough but my rule is to just use one color palette for everything i start with the main color of the background
you have the pen display which has an 11.6 inch screen with eight customizable buttons and for me the feature of a red ring
they also have the three in one cable which you can just connect to your computer in like two seconds and start sketching drawing and doodling like a breeze
and some paperwork then the freebies which includes all the same stuff in the previous tablet plus super lovable canvas bag pewdiepie and finally the cutest pen tablet
all three are great companions for any artist out there and you have a chance to win one of them now for the giveaway way way
Hey guys! Welcome back, we have a really cool video today because my friends at XP-Pen let me try out their new Artist 22R Pro Tablet.
So the screen display is 21.5" and the screen resolution is 1920x1080 which is standard in a lot of screens today.
I think you guys know how I feel about express keys -- I personally don't use them but if you love express keys there's a whole bunch of them!
We have our pen, also comes with a really cool glove, yeah and this was the main feature that I got really excited
They have all this competition and forces them to innovate and it forces them to kind of like, develop something new, maybe a wireless Cintiq! Ahh!
So maybe today we can come up with some really cool scenarios, some really cool background to help amplify her character.
I've mentioned on my channel before of having a folder -- a reference folder -- and this is what I call my second brain!
She kind of uh, appears with bats and so bats are her friends and so maybe we can kind of uh-
It would take something significantly different for me to kind of jump ship, but overall this is a really solid product.
Yeah, so you'll have three chances to win: one on my YouTube, one on my Instagram, and one on my Twitter.
Good luck and I look forward to giving three lucky winners a sweet tablet, so don't forget to subscribe and remember: every day is a color dodge day!
that's about a hundred dollars cheaper it's around $250 or maybe even as low as $1.99 it is a two gig version now
I'm going to tell you something as of this this time you should never ever ever buy a two gig laptop
you are just asking for it not to do what you want to do like if you need if you're sitting here you're going
which is basically flipping the laptop over and setting the keyboard facedown on the ground which you can see the possible problems with that
the screen is indeed flipped and finally there is tablet mode which is arguably the other actual mode in none of these quote modes
and you're just using the screen and manipulate it now this comes with Windows 8 but of course there's a free upgrade from windows 8 to Windows 10
hey type in the passer but okay so now it's in regular Windows 10 mode but watch when I flip it and turn it into there
is you think if they were going to give me a postage stamp size screen on here which it's not that small
but if they were going to give me this size screen you'd think that they would make it have a great viewing angle
it does not you have to really pretty much look directly into it otherwise the colorings off and I'm not even kidding
I mean it really has a very very shallow angle that you can view it at you basically got to look at it dead-on you know maybe
I'll do here two off but a really unusual for a laptop in 2015 to have to hold the angle this much color
wear on it so when you get it be prepared to clean it up if you are not a technical person and you are perhaps buying this at
I got rid of the edge browser right away while you didn't get rid of it you can't really but I switched over to Chrome browser
I even though you very seldom hear the hard drive at all so it is a very quiet little device and you know
it's very nice that it has a little light on there to indicate that it's on that doesn't always happen in low-end machines like this
sometimes you hit it accidentally effective hit it about four times so far on my desk just bump into something and boom yeah
this is one of those always-on ports if you need to charge things with it there is an HDMI port on the back
I'm used to seeing a barrel up and it just plugs in there and it's really quite nice and also you can plug it in either way
what do I think of this laptop what do I think of the Flex three and I'll tell you that in general I like it
the only thing you really have to get past is the screen if you can get by this big bezel and the rather shallow viewing angle
if you enjoyed this video do me a favor give me a thumbs up and subscribe for more bye you you you
everyone here is the unboxing of the anal novo7 paladin the android 4.0 ice cream sandwich tablet device is the first-ever device with the android 4.0
just come with a few specifications like it has got a 1080p output of the video and it has a wipe
it does not have a 3g option but the Wi-Fi connectivity would be good enough and the android iphone sandwich is the latest android operating system
so basically when you compare this with the kindle fire from amazon the thickness is not very much higher than that of town on
so this is the you know no seven starting up for the first time this is the Ice Cream Sandwich home screen
and root words the world as a circle so that it unlocks and these are typical home screen of the ice cream sandwich
so you don't need to put any extra pressure while you are trying to navigate to the various home screens other applications
so this is the under four point zero point one ice cream sandwich so because of now we can see the five multiple drinks which are totally customizable
not a whole lot of good really comes with it but Lenovo seems to believe they can offer up some really nice tablets for a very affordable price
that's going to make it stand out or anything but it's practical and it gets the job done and for many people that is all that really matters anyways
it's not anything that will blow you away and pixels are noticeable especially on the 10-inch model where the pixel density takes a much bigger hit
it didn't detract much from my overall viewing experience whether it was playing games or watching videos on the inside both the a8 and a10 are being powered by
on both up to 32 gigs the specs sound really generic but general performance through day-to-day usage has been far better than I've expected it to be
swiping through home screens opening up apps and browsing through the web was all fairly smooth and quick and multitasking was also not much of an issue either
I do notice some lag and the occasional drop frame especially when there's a lot of stuff happening on the screen at one time
the camera is certainly good enough for the at but really not much better for anything else with only five megapixels
that won't put such a big dent on your wallet but that is it for this review of the Lenovo Tab a eight and a ten
there's a lot of things that these tablets do really well and a lot of things that they do not so well but at the end the day
tablets with windows unfolding just around 5% of the market share but there are signs is a change is coming most
Windows tablets are now being used for business purposes and its price to go lower and power windows gross curiosity among home users
size is 7 point 85 inches it is IPS display and supports 10 finger gangsters viewing angles are good and there are many reflections on the screen
LED indicator for charge tablet back is made of aluminium and it contributes to the very nice-looking few devices living when holding hands built
there is microphone and on top there are speakers micro SD slot micro USB for charging and OTG support and combined train the calculators audio jack
Desktop games won't work well on this tablet so we didn't want to tell them but we did PC mark and 3d mark tests which completed with expected results
we've got an on/off switch on the side here and of course this is where we plug it in and the nice thing about USB see is
so if you want the cable up or down depending on how you prefer to work you can easily do that
I'm working out of a coffee shop if you were a student and you're carrying this around all day you can just pop it in
not only is it a pen tablet which gives me this pressure sensitivity as well as tilt sensitivity so that means
now let's go up to our Bluetooth settings well let's pop up in our preferences here and we're looking for something new
we're going to choose a tablet orientation so if I want to use a right-handed I'm gonna choose this if I want to use left-handed choose that option
and mapping so you don't have to use the whole tablet and I know a lot of people will do that
where's you're working on a big tablet and you're moving around like this all we're gonna do here is just drag that back click
Express keys so we can set these Express keys to do different kinds of things and we can see right now these
we've got some different applications in here we can scroll through the applications and I've got Photoshop CC 2019 so I can go in here notice
so why don't we set a keyboard here or do a keystroke and this is good for difficult piece terms like shift option command
Z or command shift C or control Z or ctrl shift Z on Windows or ctrl Z or command shift Z in Canada New Zealand Australia and the UK
so depending on how you want to talk you can customize the toggle switch on the pen as well back to our functions so those are our
I set to pen pressure and now this means that if I paint light I get a very very light misting of that brush as I push harder
I don't think I really need my touch ring on that what I'm going to do is change that to brush size
I like to lock that down so that means if I change a brush pressure is still only gonna apply to transfer
I don't like it working on size without my knowledge so I'm gonna lock that to off so no matter which brush I choose
this is always going to be set to pen pressure for opacity and the brush size is gonna be left alone you can also change them up here
so if we have a look at this and see what we've done that's before and that's after so you see what we're doing
I've just been playing wrap this a little bit and honestly this feels exactly the same is when I'm working on the medium or the large
I'm this cheaper tablets out there and it just doesn't have that nice feel I mean this just feels like pencil on paper
I love about the walk on brand versus others so I like to do very very light shading sometimes I started get a broken line
this is gonna go in my bag and this is gonna be if my laptop all the time takes up highly any space now
I'm really excited to show you the brand new Wacom Intuos Pro small now one last thing how do you say
Wacom I've heard people say Wacom Wacom the proper way of saying it is Wacom and the reason it's that is why is Japanese for harmony
so anyway guys if you like this sure if your friends tell your friends about it and smash that like button into dust and until next time
we look at its design and its quality build its hardware performance its operating system and features and in this video
I will go into more details in a moment but for now I will proceed with a quick unboxing so in the box
USB charging cable and a user's guide and now I look at the design of the tablet to the front of the tablet
you have a mic hole a power button and the volume controls to the top of the tablet you have a headphone jack
let's take a look at a response time of the touchscreen and a response of the UI the response time of the SAT is okay
but it's not as fast as we have seen in high-end mobile phones let's look at its system and hardware information to allow you to see better
I will mirror the screen to a TV box using an old app called mirror LP even though this app has no further development
av eyes the display and graphics is powered by the Mahdi T 820 GPU with a refresh rate of 56 Hertz and OpenGL ES version 3.2
so let's look at its drm information it says that s it has Google wide by never tree with no HDCP protection this allows Netflix and Amazon
but that's quite okay because 480p is suited to the screen size of this tablet anyway to give a better idea of the tablets performance
this is the result of the n2 to benchmark the s8 got a score of 42 thousand nine hundred and two
we have a usb a to usb type c cable and we also have a power adapter here and in case you're wondering it
in case you want to use this like a little little computer on the go we have our camera right here in the front
we also have one on the back and on the top here we have our headphone jack and then our little sd card slot right there
the only thing i have installed is pub g so we'll go ahead and take a look at how much storage we have left
we'll go ahead and turn up the brightness level it's at 80 81 percent right now so it's definitely good enough for viewing inside your home
got our sound seems pretty loud and that was just the you know the system's sounds it's got gps can change our navigation bar here which i like
you have to hit the power button to get the screen to come on and then you just swipe go ahead and test out the audio here
what's up everybody tony here with that tech check and today we're going to be taking a look at the brand new iphone 12.
let's go ahead and load up pub g and see what that can do okay so here we are in pubg
there is a little bit of stuttering but that could be my network so now that we're on the ground it looks pretty smooth
we're gonna go ahead and go into the settings and look to see what their uh graphics are set at okay so here
and then the frame rate it's either medium or low pretty much just like the pub g settings graphics definitely look good enough to be playable
so the interesting thing that i found out is with the sd card tray there is a slot for a sim card
enough it takes a good enough picture to let you see you know what you were trying to take a picture of but it's really
it rotates pretty quickly no real lag there so it works pretty well even though we have a ton of different apps on here now as you can see
i've got some disney and those stream just as well as youtube does so if you want to watch netflix you know like i said disney hulu
but you know if you get into the more graphic intense games like call of duty pub g stuff like that
you might have some lag some stuttering but you're still going to be able to play it at a lower resolution now
i know it says 15 hours and 55 minutes here but that's because it never reset uh its time from the first time
don't forget to subscribe and hit that little notification bell to let you guys know when i put out new videos
and honestly where else could you get a 10.1 inch full hd tablet that comes with the back kickstand and the keyboard for under 300
i do think that it has enough to operate efficiently for most of the tasks that you're going to put this through in terms of connectivity
it obviously has wi-fi it has a second generation usbc volume controller power button and then the pogo pins for the keyboard on the bottom
so just the one usbc on this guy kind of wish they would have put two so that you could charge and use an accessory at the same time
i love and is just super simple concept but for some reason apple doesn't do this with their ipad is that they put the camera
it's plastic but again it works for what it is and it's in the box and so it's tough to complain about but like i said it is serviceable
it's made out of this kind of a thin plastic that does kind of come out from the edge a little bit
so when you're holding it with the back cover on you do kind of have a little bit of sharp plastic that digs into your hands a little bit
it's kind of like a flimsy plastic so it's not really uniform when you pull it back however i mean these again small things just stuff
now if you're a student that wants something to learn remotely with or work remotely with but also you know web browse or go on social media
that's what this is perfect for so i would say students and also as a secondary computer for people that again just want something that can quickly you know
so that's how this is built and that's how it should be used and as long as you know that going into this purchase
better than when i used it before and it just seems like they did a lot of work to optimize the tablet experience on chrome os and battery
that's with a video loop playing and you know wi-fi off and all that stuff so you're typically never going to get what they claim
so if you're interested in it i'll put a link in the description below along with my full review on my blog
there is a once to same available right now so it's a dual seem so model a Miami number it's Android
hey i'm ryan from technically well and i'm checking out the king pad k77 from tablet express while the tablet may be geared more for kids
I need to install so all we need to do is just snap our fingers and here sure I know what you're right
so now we're at the part where we're gonna do a little bit of fast paint so yeah let's just okay
I I liked drawing like on this thing so what actually happened is that I use a circle tool right here
I think a lot of people are gonna hate like saying that I use the circle tool which yeah I can guess
it doesn't hunt the screen so don't worry about it now under the box you'll also have this little mount that you can put up
I'll link that in the description if you're interested first things first one of the most important things I think for any drawing tablet is the responsiveness
I started sculpting and sculpt with me so I didn't have to worry about a delay at all another thing I like is the pressure sensitivity
okay so final thoughts on the artis oldie 16 pro drawing tablet what do I think what's the pricing and would I buy it for myself
first pricing it is at a 300 $79 price tag which is actually pretty decent when it comes to drawing tablets and given the functionality
I'm excited to show you but um it has a low volume and a high volume and you got all these different modes
so i'm going to be really really extra careful with this but i'm probably not going to be extra careful with this because of my clumsiness
anyway i'm going to be changing my setup so that you guys can get a better view and i'll be right back okay
i kind of struggled a lot while opening the box because it was so big but i somehow managed to open it so yay for me anyway
i'm not sure what it's called and the pen inside the box then right after that you can see the stand of the tablet
there's the tablet along with the drawing of the character i will do and then there is my computer right there
she is an amazing gotcha tuber and artist so if you want to check her stuff out i'll leave her link in the description box below
i decided to draw her oc because i find her really cool and i never really draw these types of content
you just have to pull the lever behind it and then tilt your tablet or stand then boom you got it
yes i do if you are a beginner and you want to start off with a big screen tablet then here you go
grab it drag the the iPad of the tablet around and the nice the other kind of nice thing about this the handle
it's built into it but it is does actually act as a stand so it does rotate and then you can actually use the cut as a TV
hello everyone in this video of your review in this tablet it's an Android tablet by a brand called tech list
I don't think you would really find a case for this if each search online and the name is not really that known to find a case for this
okay you know so proper google start up okay this goes straight to dimension at the main page okay where you can stop rating straight away
the quality is amazing and it operates very smoothly as well if you can see that he does operate very smoothly
but it's not tempered one so if it folds you're more likely to break this and it's very difficult to actually buy a screen protector for this
extend that memory so you can extend the memory to 256 cake so that's pretty good it has a good battery life
attached no batteries inside and this interacts with the graphics tablet to produce those motions that you'd been used to seeing before produced by the mouse
now the only difference here is that this is much more accurate the resolution is better and it's easier more intuitive than using the mouse
let's look more closely at the tablet when you buy one of these you get the tablet itself and this one is the medium version
you also get a USB cable but mine is not connected at the now there is an optional wireless kit and that comes with three pieces
that area is a representation of the whole of the screen that you would have in front of you on your monitor on the left there are eight
LEDs one at each corner probably just about make out that that one is illuminated at the moment now the way the pen interacts with the tablet is amazing
and lo and behold you have an eraser and it's as simple as that meanwhile the interaction between the pen and Photoshop
I have running the utility program that one can use to set up the various programmable functions of the pen and the tablet now
there's a image of the pen there and it shows the two buttons and you can set these up to do a variety of things
but if i go to photoshop it says it's a keystroke and it's ctrl alt Z which means it goes back up
so that's a really really useful way of setting this up application dependent and you can get it to do precisely what you want it to do
so here's my my tool it's coming down if I press gently like so I get a little thin blog but if I press hard that gets bigger
that's that's getting close to the sort of standard that we need for a magazine picture now with the touch versions and panels
You'll find huge deals on my website where I do use affiliate links, so if you're kind enough to use one of my links, thank you.
Now a lot of the cheaper and inexpensive tablets on the market just provide you with a micro USB or a charge cable. They don't give you the adapter.
It feels good in the hands, but not on the same level as when I held my daughter for her first time after she was born.
You'll notice that you just have a single lens camera, one lens on the back, you don't have multi-camera, you don't have several different lenses.
Since the eight-inch Fire tablet has the same specs as the 10-inch Fire tablet, the big question is, what is the speed compared to the iPad?
Gonna visit my website now because I've never visited it from the Fire tablet, although it is probably cached on the iPad from a while ago. MattsDailyDeals.com.
With that being said, if you simply remove the iPad Pro and you look at this tablet on its own, the glossy display is more than sufficient.
If you were gonna shop Amazon or watch a Prime Video, obviously, the Fire tablet is formatted to run faster on all of Amazon's products, all of their apps.
The initial sign-up for the Fire tablet has more things that it wants me to do as a free trial but then it kind of leaves you alone.
It's present, but it's not in your face. And for the video screen, obviously, on an eight-inch tablet, it's always going to look inferior, but not by a lot.
And you can already see just looking through this right now, it looks like a cellphone camera from the early 2000s.
But for the sake of this demonstration, I'm gonna show you what happens when I drop the Fire tablet right onto concrete.
So I would say the durability on this is not a whole lot different from what you would see on the iPad Pro.
The screen keeps breaking and going, but the back and all of the other components, that is a hard, durable plastic.
Well if you watched my prior Fire tablet videos where I repeatedly smashed this against the hardwood floor of a building that I was in
I will tell you though, there's absolutely no tablet on the market that would do better or worse dropping it from this level onto hard concrete.
being so fun, this is not any more durable as the glass screen on the iPad, but hey, you drop it, you lose $90 to $100.
It's good for beginners, people that are looking to enter into the tablet world, that they're people that are looking to discover smarthome products.
If you want a tablet that could potentially replace a laptop or come close to that, this is the tablet to grab.
The iPad Pro, by the time you add the keyboard and the Apple Pencil, you're well north of that $1,000 mark, but it is a fully capable design system.
If you have a different tablet you want me to test, or if there's a different comparison you want me to do, please, leave a comment.

IPS display with a full HD resolution of 1920 by 1080 you've got the Intel HD 400 graphics four gigs of RAM and 64 gigs of internal storage
and you can expect to get around five to six hours of video playback which we won't be testing furthermore this supports
let's have a quick look at the ports so on this side we have a single speaker so on the top of the tablet
QWERTY keyboard and a very useful and responsive touch pad to go with it so let's do a YouTube performance on this
so let's break it down with some pros and cons so this 2 in 1 laptop represents great value powerful performance and a great build quality
Windows but you can always turn down the brightness and switch off Bluetooth to get more battery juice furthermore I absolutely love the Tenaya p screen
US dollars or 139 pounds in the UK bottom line for under $200 this is a very nice tablet with great build quality
nice 1080p screen powerful performance for gaming and streaming and it also comes with a very nice looking keyboard dock case and with that being said
i'm just gonna go with the first selection which is um once tory scans a temperature and the temperature passes then
it's going to turn the door access relay on so i'm just gonna confirm save changes so i'm gonna do a demo
the door relay has opened so you can hear the sound that that means that once a temperature scanning has passed a door will be open
gigs of internal storage and the device has an 8 inch screens at 1280 by 800 resolution compared to last year's Fire HD 8
thanks to the Z total cases for the Amazon fire 8 tablet there are over 23 models to choose from and aside from protecting your tablet
we also have two cameras one on the back and one on the front so the camera on the back is a 1.9 megapixel camera
however you're not gonna be able to install the SD card is internal storage even like that you can still save some pictures any music onto that
we don't need the highest scores on the ante to benchmark or the Geekbench for however for a tablet that costs only $79
Boxing Day or the black trade or anything like that so for that price is definitely worth it or I guess
it's 7 inch $149 tablet with 1 gig of ram 16 gigs of storage and a 1 gigahertz via wonder media wm8 950 arm cortex a9 processor
that's a mouthful but it's a relatively inexpensive processor which is part of how they're able to keep the price down here so in terms of
it doesn't come anywhere near as fast as what you would get from a quad-core device with a Tegra 3 processor like the Nexus 7
but once they open they tend to run just fine but the one problem that this tablet really has is that the screen is not an IPS display
if you're watching a video it's almost going to look like you're watching a photo negative image if you're looking at webpages same problem pictures
just don't look really as good as they should so we go from sort of full color on that image to not exactly a full color
if you get this and you plan to use it for playing some games watching some videos doing summer things you know
I think you really need to have a good display with wide viewing angles to offer a decent tablet experience and in 2013
it just it seems a little bit weird that people are still putting out tablets that don't have wide viewing angles from every conceivable direction
USB charging port and the power bond is here so I'm gonna switch you on okay also on the right side
basically has the screen is designed in a way where it protects kids eyes there is a screen resolution is 1024
it has features such as light limiting time so kids can use the play games a certain time and the automatic switch off
Antti blu-ray screeners also predicts kids eyes it has built-in 3000mah battery capacity with one gig ram and 16 gb internal memory
so i actually was doing exactly that when i was creating this drawing anytime i wanted to focus on a detail
the tablet is that you can add custom commands to the express keys you can create your own command combinations which i really liked
i first use it to highlight the surface that i want as one color as one solid color for example the skin
even though it's just one simple change so then after i do that i then create another layer which i mask onto the skin layer
this is how i start adding the shadows so i also use the lasso tool once again to add shade section per section
the layers on photoshop literally represent the layers that i would normally create with traditional watercolors so i use the lasso tool
which is how i like to paint with watercolors tip number three is to use the smudge tool to fully capture
so it adds to the effect that we're trying to achieve the brushes that i'm actually using are kyle's watercolor brushes which are part of his brush
so this is to add a watercolor paper texture as the top layer and set it to either multiply or color burn
i would choose between one or the other depending on the look that you're going for now there's a lot of free downloadable watercolor paper textures online
was that the top button of the stylus was only for the eraser from my experience with other graphic tablets albeit limited
i had to assign the brush as an express key on the side but with another graphic tablet that i've tried before i didn't have to do that
because that same exact button on the stylus allowed me to switch from eraser and then to a brush which is how you naturally work
i will leave all of their links in the description box below so that concludes this video my thoughts on the product and the artwork
i am desperate to try new art products but i have no idea what to purchase and also feel free to share this video as well
it's just there for screws one huge corner and there's some holes for the speaker there as well drilled into the case it's actually quite thick
this is probably just wood insiders and the lettuce and then or cardboard us have been hard but yeah wraps all around
it's got a nice leather but cool like that and you can do that and can actually fold it back like that and use its little stand
the edge of this is metal so that might be at antenna but it seems been broken at some point because the this is refurb unit
usually you can fit four icons up and down here and the Google bar with you can only fit three it runs android 2.1
google only will show you the apps it thinks a compatible for your device because the Chinese tablets aren't official google devices
so if we ever get a chinese tablet with the android market on it chances are it won't actually have anything useful
either and let's go on so f1 because everyone likes the old formula 1 there and it's one to the mobile site
some nice light sites you can scroll around quite easily and assumes no it's disabled multi-touch on mobile sites estonian calm
single core probably made by someone like rupture because they tend to make the process of these things 256 meg of ram
lego store miam is also a fairly light site but I said work absolutely fine multi-touch not the most responsive in the world
I'd suggest going to watch an annual review because this ain't one of them there resistive buttons part complain this at the time cost
so that's what we're talking here having said that it doesn't feel is heavy but it's solid heavy not lead weight heavy
it's just all very well put together so at the time 80 quid would have been a very fair price for it at the moment
US dollars can only be used for data transmission which i think is incorrect because you can use them to buy tablets like this as well and this tub
I'd suggest going to one of those all-knowing Chinese wholesale sites and wake nor the one and take your chances because the probably meant should be what you order
Oso tablet look at it a pen signer and for drawing and writing you can get like two different variations one with like three
I cannot wait to dig into this so quite badly but whatever there we go I am going to enjoy the spin
it wears off if you draw and of course it wears off very fast if you pay also and you don't hover so you can replace your
you're going to need this the size of a tablet this is just for signing and very basic drawing and awesome this really not much else to say
I personally would actually like to see it on the right side on the front sticking out that would be very awesome
I assume I just flip it and then go into left hand mode because there is - of all the tablets that I've use
as you can see you can screw this off and guess what you need a triple-a battery to to make it work
you have seen it in the gameplay bits but it's not annoying because it is so small so I can just move it away when I want to
I've been playing also for around five years and this is the first time I've used a tablet this small so at least I have an excuse
if this was like a forty dollar tablet or something then you might want to look somewhere else for a tablet
it took me around four years to find the template that actually did that and this is the second one so good on you
Eddy allows you to set child profiles in which you can set different age profiles and child profiles and allow them access to different kind of applications
so if you run out of memory you can install an SD card and expand the memory it comes with a 3200 milliampere
don't forget to give us a thumbs up by pressing the like button below for more such videos stay subscribe by pressing the subscribe button
the picture is going to be all bland and it's not going to really fit the colors as you were drawing on your normal monitor
so this video doesn't have any footage of me unboxing the tablet but I'm going to tell what's in the box okay
I was really worried about it because some people said chip tablet don't work properly no so for example when they're playing also with them
this could be good for dragging players like me but uninsured for hovering players because the long lead might touch the tablet
relatively that's certainly affordable so in an effort to find out if it's even worth spending that on a tablet at this range
you've got a micro usb port and just next to that a micro hdmi port going back to the back of the tablet
of course the top and bottom strips are still plastic as is the rest of the body including the front screen
it's obviously not mind-blowing in any way you don't have to be a pixel peeper to see that the pixel density is really low at just 213 ppi
i thought it would be 60 hertz but apparently it's 55 hertz at least according to what in-way is showing in terms of software
so you've got access to tons of applications and games as long as you don't have too many applications open in the background
well when you've only got two gigabytes of ram but it seems to be fine as long as you're not trying to use resource hungry applications
just don't expect every single game to work great when it comes to the cameras who really cares about cameras on the tablet even the more expensive android tablets
well it depends if you've got the money to spend then of course not you should be getting a higher end table
but if you're strapped for cash and it's either a budget tablet or nothing then the k10 will do the job
it's not as fast as a more expensive tablet and that's to be expected but like i said before it's fast enough
performance isn't out of this world but the more i use it the more i realize it does what it intends to do
if you're someone who needs a tablet don't have a lot of money to spend or if you want to get a first-time tablet for a child
it has all the typical features of a tablet however there is no 3G slot as they mentioned when I bought this unit
I don't see a and that completes my review although the device works great don't buy from I also have a big flat view for view
or whatever you want to argue is better than the other there is no right answer to this there is no wrong
i'm going to give you my thoughts on all um from an audio standpoint from a graphic design standpoint and a photography standpoint because down
everyone would be using graphics tablets or they'd be using ergonomic mouses and i'm like is it mercies or is it mice
and there's times that you know from a lot of playing and a lot of gigging and that i won't be able to actually make a fist
finish so it it has a little bit it has a bit of weight to it has a bit of a premium feel to it
so you can have a left and right click or whatever you want on the on the pen which comes in quite handy too as well
you can use the keyboard shortcuts like i have for years so if you're so used to them you can still use them and you're in with the tablet
a graphics tablet is important for photographers because your work is just as intensive as a graphic designer as an artist
get into the see if it see if it is something for you but there is a learning curve with these
there is a coordination that you need to get between on on the pa on the pad and looking at the screen
so when you do buy you do need to give yourself a little bit of time to get used to it
nick page is famous for saying that he got rid of all his mouse to make sure that he only used this
i still use the trackball mouse in my workflow and i use it in conjunction with the pen when i need to use the pen
i hope you got something from this if you are on the fence about whether or not you should invest in a graphics tablet
January I a the edges of your toast I did but also daddy was just saying that he had a chicken
that's good news the fat Chuck's red bubbie you like I'm gonna hear that side and quite a lot what do you think Bobby
well we think it was going mm is he gonna pick passengers up and weird to think it was finally going to dink
that's the memory card slot and then we got the plug for the AC adapter and there's the hardware button and on the other side
actually so if you want to put all your music apps one folder some other stuff like we can change the background okay
so all the new cobia 4.0 tablets run and a cortex any processor at the single core processor runs the one gigahertz
so that's one of the problems with the COBE tablets they don't have official access to the Google Play Store for Android apps
I'm sure that somebody will come up with a hack to add it sooner or later I went ahead and so it comes with the get jar app store
it didn't come with the flash pre-installed so I went ahead and got flash over here from the one mobile and it
HDMI port that I've noticed when you hook it up to your TV however it still remains to have this black bar at the bottom of the screen
but what if the deal is here when the background is white like this you can see a lot of glitter enos so
I noticed I know some people don't notice it and don't really care but as far as I'm concerned I really don't like it for reading
just because when you have the white background like this you can really see how glittery the background is the white coloration and it just kind of annoys me
I know it just sort of depends on your personal preference as far as that goes select with any Android 4.0 tablet
another tablet unboxing and review and hopefully a little bit of a speed paint at the end as well um as xp pen uk
um on the back some specifications so as you can see it's a battery free stylus brush sensitivity levels which to be honest
uh it's compatible with i mean like all the current software really that it's most commonly used so um yeah oh and it comes with eight customizable shortcuts
they've got their little uh fox sticker uh with their opening times and email if you need to contact them which yeah
i mean i haven't actually looked through any of this yet so i don't know what this is stickers but we're also like oh that's really cute
yeah it's for their 15th anniversary and some little postcards that's so cute and then in here is obviously all the fun stuff hindsight
i'm sure but yeah on the back you can see it's got the grips to hold it in place which is always handy
then it will take you to a download page where you can select the appropriate software for you either mac or windows
um once you've extracted the files and run it and it will just bring up a pop-up thing that you literally just click install
excuse the shaky camera in the drawing portion of this video um i was filming with my ipad literally balanced on my lap
because it's not so small that you feel constricted by it but it's not big like you can fit it anywhere really like that
i think this tablet is fine as well for people who are more i guess my level like intermediate level like i had no problems using this tablet
personally i think that's a fair price for this tablet and i think it's certainly affordable or achievable in terms of a saving up goal
so yes if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them down below and i will do my best to reply
Sai to got to work testing the tablet and was first caught by just how different the pen felt compared to my way on 86 10
the tablet itself the type-c USB wire to connect the tablet to your PC a pen and a neat little felt pocket for the pen
it is a smooth tablet of clean design and has a low profile coming to only around one third of an inch where exactly 9 millimeters off the desk
the surface of the tablet has four spots which have touched sensitive screens and a gesture screen between them for a custom gesture
the pen itself is bad realists and feels like the same low-cost molded plastic as the Hawaiian age 610 pro pen
the tablet has a 10 by 6 inch working area but the entire device takes up about 13 inches by 8 inches
it's sturdy and works quite good for being only 47 99 beating my way on H 6/10 Pro buy a whole twenty-two US dollars on Amazon
I had to intentionally push down to in order to get to operate the wire I do appreciate however instead of going straight out
actually has an l-shaped connector that goes into the tablet itself then your standard USB C input that goes into the back of your computer
I don't quite understand myself yet but I'll let you decide whether you want a battery list or a battery powered pen
just judging by the specs here and the pro moniker that should be much more powerful than the ones they released in 2019
LCD now nowhere in the manual or on the box does this say it's an IPS display but viewing angles really
for a hundred and thirty dollar tablet 32 gigabytes of internal storage plus a microSD card slot good up to 128 gigabytes
ROM but I do call this the Walmart launcher because at the very bottom we always have that Walmart icon that'll bring us right to Walmart
comm and there's three other apps built in that you can disable but you can't delete Sam's Club grocery and Vudu so one thing I never really talked about
so we're on the lower end here with Geekbench 5 and finally antutu total score 90 1617 like I mentioned the Amazon Fire HD
this is a cheap tablet with a 1080p screen but 720 and 1080 p video is totally possible and it works very well
it's time to test out some gaming we're gonna test out minecraft asphalt 9 King of Fighters all-star Call of Duty mobile and pub G
we have asphalt 9 and to my surprise it actually performs quite well a lot of these lower end tablets that I test
I wouldn't run out and buy one of these specifically to play pub G on but you could get by playing this game
casually on a tablet like this and finally for native Android gaming call of duty mobile again very well optimized game it runs on low-end tablets and low-end phones
I'm at the lowest settings lowest frame rate and it is playable now one of the things I was really excited about
I'm still set to as low as I can go here and we're getting an average of 45 FPS out of this one
I'm at 1x resolution with all the hacks on and if I go to 2x it just won't run at full speed so far
but if you're looking for a tablet to watch videos on check your email check the news and do some web browsing
this is gonna work out just fine but as for raw performance this really just isn't gonna get you there the Amazon fire 10 HD
I really hate yes you can install Google Play on it but it's still not stock Android and this is running Android 10 right out of the box
I thought about to try some graphics tablet that so today I am here with Hui on in speed oi h 4:30 p graphics tablet
the pain has two programmable buttons which is great and of course it comes with drivers you have to download the driver from their website according to Euro s
I thought that it is the diversity but it is not this stab has very good pressure sensitivity which is also customizable
and let me just and let me just start off by saying that you will need a computer for this tablet
it will require some kind of computer pc laptop or a mac to be hooked up to in order to work so without further ado
the box also contains the cables and we'll look into them a bit later as well as part of their anniversary edition
there's some cute artwork with xp pens mascot that is also part of the anniversary edition out here to the left
and if you want to power your tablet using this instead of your computer pick the outlet that fits in your country and connect it to the power supply
stylus feels a bit more firm which is a major plus in my book because i prefer firm styluses over bouncy ones
and it's super thin and light and you can fold it back together so you can easily bring this with you on the go as well
so they're easy to manage at home as well as on the fly to connect the innovator 16 display to your computer
there's also a usb extender if you need to extend for instance the cable to the power supply in the quick guide
you can see exactly how to set up the tablet with your computer after hooking up the hdmi a usb and the power on the back of my pc
i've installed enough xp pen tablets to know that installation actually means installation path and install is the actual installment button
now you can access the tablet's driver called pen tablet and here you can change the pressure sensitivity calibrate the tablet and set up all your shortcuts
you can look up these shortcuts in your drawing software mine are comma and period you can see at the bottom of the screen here
so let's do a few quick tests before moving on to the drawing demonstration first is the jitter test also known as the diagonal line test
you use a ruler with your stylus to see how much the cursor jitters when you draw slowly along the ruler
the time i've been using xp pens products i have never felt like parallaxing was their big issue and on this
there's so little jitter that i could just work with no smoothing at all but depending on the drawing software you use
but the feeling of the innovator 16 just happens to be so much better and in the end that means more to me than the size of the screen
the drawing monitor that i have tried that comes closest to the wacom cintiq pro excluding my ipad pro and apple pencil from this comparison
so that was it from me for this time and i'm excited to see you in the next video until then guys take care bye you
Android tablet and we're going to go for the hard work but the hardware really is not the key to this
obviously with the tablet made for kids is that it doesn't break when they drop it so this provides a good amount of protection around it what
I you know it's not going to blow you away with any of the tech specs on it is running Android 6.0
this quest feels like a game but they're actually learning in terms of what's going on in here so you've got scores
all that fun stuff gamification of everything what we're going to do is we're just kind of gonna take you through this
let me go back and find that for you as well so this treasure box here kind of a neat idea here
let me just allow this and allow this so you can see it and so what you can do is you know
complete pre-k you clear the table things like that so they've got a chore list and as they do it they're marking it off
you can unlock this more like if you do enough chores you can have more playtime on this or you can actually have a word if they want to
Walmart's they have a link up through the Walmart site where you can actually use some of those points and say alright
so everything's safe here so rather than going to the Google Play Store and who knows exactly what they'll find here you'll find a bunch laughs
I want to show here quickly so I've gone into parent mode to show you in the parent mode you of course can use this as a standard
Android tablet going to click over here so you can see so I can go to the Google Play Store do whatever I want so you know
so that's a quick look at the Nabi SC we think it's a really good deal at $79 and for the younger kids going to work out
i really wish they could include a sticker that we could like put on the back of the tablet on the inside
it has everything else you need like the cables and the pen and the usbs that i'm gonna talk about later
so let's just get to it installing this thing right okay so installing this on the pc was very easy it worked right away after i plugged it in
i guess and that is pretty much it after i did that i could just go into a drawing program and test it out which i did right here
it felt super weird to draw from a tablet onto the phone but then after a while i got kind of used to it
if anything happened or like the pen not working that it was just because i pressed the eraser option by mistake
and that was not the tablet's fault it was mine and besides that i did not have any problem with it
write the symbols of sounds and um that is not easy when you do online classes and i asked my teacher teacher
i asked the lady from xp pen and they advised me to not use it with osu but i did anyway
then i think you should look into other models from xp pen that they have on your site which you can find on aliexpress too and right now
because when it was announced i was thinking back to the old days when i used to buy really cheap electronics
if you want to load a bunch of movies up onto this before a road trip or anything like that now
we have a vga front facing camera and then a 2 megapixel rear facing camera which is capable of recording 720p hd video
the thing that i didn't think this was gonna run was games especially heavy games like goat simulator and hearthstone and i downloaded also cross hero
as far as goat simulator goes it also worked perfectly and actually never really experienced any lag with that game which was really nice to see
i think when you pay for something that's 50 and cheaper than other things you don't want to feel like you got a somewhat inferior product to the rest
just in case you want to later move them onto an ipad or nexus 9 or a larger or more expensive kindle
lastly is students and this is actually quite good because usually students are on a budget and 50 isn't too much that's gonna break the bank now
of course you can load textbooks onto this pdfs and all that good stuff so that you can get all your class things you can
so in the end this tablet actually does a lot more than you would expect it to and the only problems that i actually found with
this is that whenever you're loading things you just gotta let them load for a few seconds before you start scrolling or anything
you'll get some cool book covers there and sometimes you'll get some good deals for some prime products and stuff like that so with that said guys
Ram I really do wish they would have added at least 1.5 in this machine but unfortunately we're just stuck with one here
you can buy this tablet with either 16 or 32 gigabytes of internal storage but both of them offer the micro SD card slot
this game works great these Amazon tablets have been great for media consumption like video playback music and even ebooks here we have
that's also going to work fine but I wanted to show you the streaming working time for my favorite part emulation
FPS and by the way I'm using Moop n64 + FZ for these games the cpu GPU combination in this tablet actually works really well for ps1 games here
we have bloody roar - one of the harder games to emulate in my opinion and we're getting a constant 60 FPS
I also tested out some super graphics games so if you want to emulate NES game boy game boy color Game Boy Advance NeoGeo some name stuff
and if you can pick one of these up for around $39.99 and you don't already own the Amazon fire eight
I think it's worth $50 to get you one of these now if you're not going to be doing any intensive gaming on here it will work for you
I really appreciate you watching if you want to learn how to install Google Play on your new fire 7 tablet
but it'll also work on the new Fire 7 and if you're thinking about purchasing one of these I will leave links to Amazon in the description
they got those new colors and it is a nice little spec bump from the old fire 7 but if you already own the 8
your tablet in as as far as camera is only 0.3 megapixel front-facing rear of facing or main camera ok so 0 3 and 0 2.3 the same
the charger is the the one that Samsung Galaxy s5 has because other devices come to the newer version of the charger like charger
also play install applications or you can with Walmart while my rosary boudu Sam's Club and Walmart books and these are the languages that comes with this tablet
these are the features that comes with the camera not many to be honest and I really hope that these can help you out to take a decision
I have tutorial how to remove those values and also if by accident they change the language or Tulk bug has been activated
like there is a boy's on your skin every time you touch any application or even the screen with their phone so
there's also this status indicator light and it blinks blue and the pen is near detection range and it remains blue when the pen really is touching the surface
we've got a rear main camera here with the flash and here you've got the volume controls and the power button speaker
sounds not bad so three and half millimeter stereo jack there the Dell 30-pin connector here just Galaxy Tab also uses a 30 pin connector
if you see my tap here and move side-by-side you can tell which widgets are running on what music social networking home your web shortcuts
game Kindle app a golf game Slacker Radio HP moles and putting on pretty much every device lightly and t-mobile TV which is pretty cool
I played 450 without contract and we would still go out the galaxy tab for $50 more but again the choice is yours
while the operating speed of the device is backed by a 1.8 gigahertz quad-core processor along with 2 gigabytes of RAM
it comes with both a front and rear facing camera but the most astounding feature is the Alexa hands-free which offers some exclusive features at number 2
in case more than one user operates the device it is also operating voice commands along with the home assistant pack which is powered by Alexa
it also has a kid's pack which includes stickers blue light screen filter and a shock resistant bumper at number three
since most of the eight gigabytes of internal storage is occupied by the system software we have embedded links to the product in the description below
that's enough to download as many um apps kids apps however i can also expand it to 128 gig by the microsd memory card
it provides a lot of grip to it and easy to hold as well also it comes with a screen protector as well so you won't get scratches on
however they also provided a second one in case the first one gets damaged too much it also comes with um parent to control as well
and this one has that built in so you can control it the way you want it and how long the user for etc
a software built into it and hd lcd display as well also it comes with a quad core 1.5 gigahertz cpu wi-fi 2. gigahertz 2.4
when you're switching on this is how it looks it comes with a few apps already built in like draw um learning animals a little planet planet pianist
sorry spin guess and you call it youtube and stuff but you can pull parent to control all of them your karaoke now
that's because of those of those additional um kids apps it also comes with a privacy where you can control it
10 has a full on octa-core processor built into it with three gigs of ram 32 gigabytes of all in all storage and also has an ips hd display
so basically you can see everything in a nice bright display without too too much eye fatigue due to that ips display last
we are in an era of a zoom due to the virus so of course this is very important to consider
it has four gigabytes of internal memory which with a microSD cards you can go to 32 gigabytes it has built-in camera and speaker
so you can use it with a speaker that will produce music and not only that but you can use it to make
Skype calls it has Wi-Fi a total 11 B G and N if you have an N router then you can get speeds up to 100 megabits
you get sheering which causes the screen to turn white and you'll notice in the center here you have a black area and along the edges
and again this tablet is a polaroid tablet with a quad core processor built in also to some of the smaller cheaper tablets
it's it's pretty quick not much lag as the standard widgets it does have the digital clock and analog clock if you like that
I do I do like the analog clock pretty good but I do like the digital better this is a Google tablet by way of
Google you'll have your you know Google Settings Google Plus hangout maps maps work very well on this tablet but well okay
there's some more the yep Google Play and you also have the newsstand and you can also read books on this Gmail comes standard very responsive
so if you'd like to ask it a question or something that does work animals-- so it does come up without
you'd be better off if you have your own headphones or a Bluetooth speaker I use a Bluetooth speaker with this
it works very well in really dim light and and that's probably where you want to use it inside because outside or any place that has direct sunlight
it's just going to wash it right out and you're you're more or less just carrying around a heavy mirror and the unit is had
I don't really care for it on a scale from one to ten for this tablet I'd give it about a probably a six
they could have really spent a little bit better time and put a like at least a 720p screen on this
it's it's such a waste to have such a good tablet and one the waste so much and then have a crappy screen on it but anyway
USB type-c for charging and sync and we have our micro SD card slot moving around to the top of the unit
the CPU is an octa-core it's cortex a 55 it's a 28 nanometer and it's made by you know sock or yuna
SOC it's the SC 98 63 a personally never heard of this we have four cores at 1.6 gigahertz and four cores
now it doesn't hinder functionality at all but it could look a lot better if it was just a full laminated
ABG and an AC Wi-Fi so we can pick up that 5 gigahertz network bluetooth 5.0 and it does have 8
I don't think we can game on this for 15 hours but we could get a good solid 6 hours of gaming out of something like this
Hertz here and finally if I start up a game in ppsspp one that should very well run at 60 FPS on this machine
I'll just go ahead and open up YouTube really quick and we'll test out Big Buck Bunny as you can see loads up very quickly
we're playing at 1080p here but at 50 Hertz but overall this tablet is working great for a media streaming device and keep in mind
I ran a few benchmarks and I wanted to compare this to a very similarly priced tablet the 2019 Fire HD 10 over on the left-hand side
I have this set to as low as it can go even the resolution scale and we're still getting lag you'll notice
once you get going or get going mining you will notice a drop down significantly even with that little blip there
I'm sure it would be much better with a controller instead of using this large touchscreen for Call of Duty mobile but either way
but there's so many of these subpar tablets on the market that people have just kind of given up on them now
right now so we're going to be taking a closer look at this in just a second but I do want to let you know that
I always like to remind people that you're kind of buying at your own risk and you're never quite sure what you might end up with
a lot of tablets put on at least more expensive tablets put on a layer to prevent that kind of buildup
this one doesn't have that and we've seen better quality out of other $200 or less tablets including some from name brands like
it looks like it's working ok for a video watching and web browsing and that kind of thing and this is about what
you'll see a little bit of lag here as it's running and I think partly because it is running at that higher resolution
and there we got a score of 976 we puts it pretty much in line with some of the other tablets
plus we looked at last week is just slightly slower than this one but within the margin of error so by and large again
it really doesn't look all that great but again if you got to take a video or something you can do it in a pinch on
I think they sell this in various colors for kids and I believe they also sell this exact same tablet for adults
it's got a solid feel to it some of the features that it has has cameras on the front and the back it's got a microphone micro
it's not that bad helps fight the reflections like any screen would what I want to show off here is so this is looking at it
it doesn't take all that long to charge it but it also doesn't hold a charge very long just in the time
I don't have anything so I just said none so I'll pull it up so see if you can see this okay
I may be missing something but what it calls games every single one of them is just a YouTube video there
so there's not a whole lot to that it has books and it's kind of a cool idea but you have to
you now know my code so if you happen to you know break into my house and take this and your kids see this video
they're gonna be able to get into regular mode but you have to enter a code to get out of it and I did try
I haven't tried you know throwing it down on the ground so I don't know how well it protects it but it's easy to grip right
I think you'll be happy but yeah don't go in thinking you're gonna get a just a high-end tablet for a lot less money so that's all
these are pretty useful since these screens tend to quickly pick up fingerprints and stains some information on where to download the drivers
nice little container which can also be used as a pen holder and finally the power supply with its wall adapter which click together nicely
Express keys and one touch bar which is typically used to zoom in and out it weighs 1.35 kilograms and is only eleven point five millimeter stick
Young's website find the drivers linked to the model of your tablet and run the installer after that everything worked like a charm
+ S key by setting one of the keys on the tablet as the control key and another as the shift key
I've been using the Wacom Intuos draw which didn't have any integrated display and the fact that the canvas pro has an integrated screen is just a game-changer
you know you don't want to be wiping sweat off your screen every 10 minutes so these are very useful and for a long time
I actually thought these were to prevent you from accidentally drawing with the palm of your hand and like your typical touchscreen
Kindle Fire this is the Kindle Fire HDX and certainly obviously it's going to be Amazon's best Kindle yet a lot of improvements inside
Kindle Fire on the block this one's called the Kindle Fire HDX they went with the HDX name because well this is super high resolution
it is even compared to other tablets on the market 7 inch size this is 1920 by 1200 pixels so that's bigger than 1080p resolution
it's not the only kid on the block to have that resolution but it's nice to see it especially in something like a Kindle product because well probably
there will be an 8.9 inch model just like there was last year for the HD model that was going to be coming out sometime by November
they're sharp they're nice-looking and get a mix of content your applications that you've used any content you've looked at for example
cover there of an album playing you get suggestions underneath because Amazon always loves to sell you things know if you pick the web browser
you won't make that mistake because one little depression you'll feel here versus two for the volume controls and logically speaking
if the speakers are up top here your up volume is going to be towards the top on the side here
that's always one drawback when reading books some people might still prefer the Kindle paperwhite if you just mostly read books because well
separately if you want so you can see we have English UK English US French Spanish Italian Japanese simplified Chinese Portuguese and German
so for those of you who are hoping to read books and on the languages for example you can go ahead and do that as always
and this has the kid mode so if you want to give this to your kid and you don't want them mucking around on certain websites
who are trying to decide between the similarly priced Nexus 7 2013 edition here it is taller and narrower is always
that's about as fast as you're going to get if Snapdragon 800 sup they're competing with the Tegra 4 and Samsung's latest X knows Octus CPUs very fast 3
you can you can either tap here to watch the trailer or if you don't want to see that you just slide the unlock
that might be something you actually want or a book that's on sale or an accessory or something like that there will be
Wi-Fi plus 4G LTE models there's an AT&T model and a verizon model and that's going to add a hundred dollars to the price available the same storage capacities
this is a Kindle product that means you don't get access to the Google Play Store here you do get access to Amazon's Kindle app store
The Weather Channel all sorts of things like that but if you paid for a lot of applications keep that in mind now probably
I'm sure the clever folks out there going to find a way to route this and then maybe get the Google Play Store in here
actually you have to get ahold of those apks which is the installation files and then we go to applications and then you see apps from unknown sources
then get yourself a file manager and there's a couple of free ones available on the Kindle Store and you use ES File Explorer
you copied some of those apks that you want to install find your SD card which is just what it's called it really doesn't have an SD card
and you just tap on one of those to run it and install it and that's how you're going to get application side loaded on here
of course you have access to all of Amazon's as well and those are available up here under newsstand so anything you tap on you can download
you can do it in landscape mode if you want as well but you know the text is going to get kind of teeny there
it's much more intuitive on this and is using the web browser on your PC go figure if you have an iOS tablet
this is more for those folks who want a real nice fast device with a great screen but still a primary interest in consuming
I want to do a review of my Wacom Intuos 3 tablet graphics tablet apparently and I've had this baby for about 15 years
I think and I'm just going to kind of go through it not spec by spec which is my experience and my thoughts and like what
I don't know if you can tell but it's got a decent weight to it um but not too much and really fine construction
I've never had to replace the nib on this in 15 years I've never once replaced a little nib and you can see it looks pretty good
if this thing falls off on the back you've got the eraser and this thing has a little push see how it goes in which is really nice
I don't know what it is but no I mean there's like a plastic plastic covering and but it's just super sturdy
I've almost always transported it and as you can see there are some slight scratches so you can see some scratches there but this is completely normal
my companion - even after a month of using it had little micro scratches all over the screen and I was actually very careful with that one
I have this one programmed the option for color selection you know like I don't know what the other ones are
this can you use to zoom in and out so it's like a little a little pad you go up and down to zoom in and out
I'm thinking the companion has more levels but honestly like it doesn't matter this is got more than enough levels that you should then you should need
it just doesn't seem as like hyper responsive and nice as the pressure and stuff like that aside from that the last thing
fancy like that and it's long enough that you know you can plug it into the left side of the computer and have it on the right
compared to this it felt like a piece of cheap plastic this one feels like like a beastly chunk of plastic
it doesn't have this nice ergonomic design and doesn't it feels a lot a lot lighter in flimsier it's not as nice and experience to use it as it
you know like the color area in or if you want to get a long line just kind of go like that
so let's go ahead and see what you inside the box so first off it looks we have a little ejector tool for your expandable
we have our user guide and a little QuickStart guide there's a USB type-c cable and here we have our little wall adapter it's 5 volts 2 amps and
there might be some up in the top right-hand corner but for the most part it is evenly distributed and the screen is nicely lit
it's pretty responsive just as you would expect a tablet to be it's also pretty quick to do orientation changes so that's pretty good as well
it doesn't have to be super quiet and it's not gonna the sound isn't gonna blow you away but it definitely is adequate for the tablet
you don't need it to be you know blaring to where people can hear you across the room but it definitely has perfectly adequate sound for you listening
but if you're not going to use that you can increase the internal storage by utilizing that SD card which is a great feature
because if you run out of space for apps you can always have a backup to add more so as I said before
I do have my screen brightness all the way up so you guys can easily see what's on the screen and for the most part in my usage
everybody that's going to be using the tablet so that 5 gigahertz band is definitely working very well now for the most part
IO you can use Hungry Shark you can also play a candy crush and temple run and those run perfectly fine
we're not having any problems or issues with the game running perfectly fine so here we are playing a little bit of pub
it's not the best but it'll definitely give you a good image especially for what you're paying for this tablet and then the still images
it'll definitely do pretty much everything you're going needed to do whether you're reading streaming videos listening to music reading the screen
let you guys form your own opinion and we'll get to the negatives later first off it was really pretty easy to install
obviously you don't use the screen that stock with your vehicle but it does use the brain for a good chunk of it okay so
sorry so it's actually a tablet that you can actually do tablet like things on which you can go to the
how do you get the sound to work on the internet so you can watch youtube videos and all that stuff but so far
can you stock it routines like I said a lot of the same features that it had before now this one
I think I'm not sure but I think you can actually have you can actually have on-screen displays for both which is going to neat now
I really don't know what good this does maybe I don't understand it but it doesn't seem to go in anything else going to console
Bluetooth routines in the vehicle but it also can go through the tablet which is another weird thing they both work but still kind of strange right
I have I have tested it but I don't really carry around the USB drive full of music or anything I stream pretty much everything from my phone camera
the stuff that comes with this like the external speaker the external microphone some other stuff that if you have a bare-bones truck this includes it
I mean it's just like I said it's kind of confusing like I know the button for it but I can't remember where it is now
Google has a pretty good set up there and I don't mind it but the sound doesn't seem to work like I said anything
the reason being is that I went ahead and recorded all my footage of the unboxing the video getting first impressions like doing biplanes
I think that was good enough time for me to actually give you a detailed review of the tablet product itself for these four also
I don't know what the [ __ ] happened probably like a beer and I hit it or something like that and I'm wondering by God
it has the on/off button for the wireless so if you turn it on it's going to have the LED turned on
how important weight distribution is because for the 80/20 rechargeable pen which is like the same thing as the oh so tablet 2016 rechargeable pen
I'm holding to a stick that is just like floating around like this doesn't feel like a pen to me but this does so
it's probably a lot cheaper - this has like this plastic you feel which I liked in the beginning but it went
this is like it's very very grippy and has this like really slight triangular triangular shape to it which makes the pen very ergonomic at the same time
I'll see if I can try to spend more time with it in the future and give you an idea of that in the future but for now
I want to tell you a few things about this Kindle tablet and for kids that I think it are really good so the first one
it's like it looks like a bumper so whilst the screen itself isn't actually kind of protected by anything you can see there
that's built in now the stand it's quite stiff to open a bit more tricky for little hands but they do get used to it
when if for example your child's playing a certain game that needs to be in that land in that vertical view
especially if you've got slightly younger children and I'm not sure how well you'll be able to see on here but you can set up child profiles
I think it's up to four child profiles on the same device so I'm just redoing my son's one on here so I can talk you through it
we did not really have an issue with and but 16-gig is not that big and although it can be extended to
and this is a 7-inch Ice Cream Sandwich Android 4.0 tablet PC with it's powered by a one gigahertz CPU has one review by ddr3
RAM before we get my drum and of course it has Wi-Fi and this our Cove has a relatively new brand
this reviewers going to show you the user interface the pre-installed apps icons all that good stuff do some web browsing before we get started though make sure to
I just got did a review for the our Nova g3 which is a tablet PC for adults or kids and I kept on accidentally pressing pressing into languages
okay so no but no body button so it has to be done through the player which is easy enough so you can hear hear
I guess but uh pushing the gallery you can so you can so has a nice cartoon already preinstalled so again
and if once you get there to be typing just prime comm you can just do a search for child pad and that should come up
you'll have to watch part 1 to actually know how to get that gift though and you also saw the bill of the tablet
AM dragon touch and it is very unpredictable protective case as you can see and he also has a stand as well
you can find a bear branded ones a lot faster for that price especially in this you know around this time where the law of tablets are coming now
okay it has a built in quad-core processor with a one gig ram and a gig rom know enough to actually to store enough apps etc like that
M screen now the IPS screen is brilliant occurred because he has 178 degree wide angle angle v with IPS screen
there's a kid's mode here you go to the kids mode and then you can you know choose the way you want this em layout to be okay
you would make it any way where you know it's made for you know you can have the parallel four controls so
who has a camera the front and a camera at the back with the volume buttons on the right side volume up and down button with a micro
most tablet will have that kind of feature anyways but he has Wi-Fi so we can connect to internet and YouTube etc
do you want to find out more information about this or one of you know go on searching yes and check this in product tapping dragon touch y88
that's a nice looking entry-level drawing tablet it comes with a good amount of features and the specs don't seem to be too bad
Yong the report rate is at two hundred and thirty three RPS pressure sensitivity comes with 2048 levels and as for the hand and pad resolution 5080
long should be a bit longer but not a big deal and beside the USB connection is a micro SD card with the pre-installed eight gigabyte class 10 card
I've been drawing with this tablet for like an hour or so and I see no scratches caused by the pen tip on the working area and now
no but seriously now although my drawing skills are let's say below average from the drawing tablet point of view there was no problem
I don't even think it comes with anyways whatsoever it could be wrong about that but as far as I can remember
alright just gonna move this this by the way if anyone seen my bubble horde trailer the one where I show up it working on a phone
I think these are digital for holding their pen or something yeah okay I taught the little nubs yeah okay for the pins and holds up the nubs
if you order a tablet new it'll come with those tiny pins and people know that okay so that's the USB charger I guess
yeah does your USB extender just like if you wanna get some distance while you're charging it so if your test reach
I'm not gonna show it on there now till they start like drawing but I forgot to show off this cliff
as soon as you get in game you'll find your extra rewards here in your inbox for the next 30 days
the first thing i noticed about the tablet aside from how big the screen was there aren't any buttons on it instead
i just personally like having a little feedback whether it's a little vibration or click just to confirm that i actually press something
so for this review i summon the discord server again and asked what i should make to test it out and everybody mostly voted for rosalina
we made a short animation for this review and rendered out a few pictures to show off how she came out
i want you guys to let me know what you think of the model and the animation we made for this video in the comments below
you should also check out our other social media accounts if you want to support us or look at what else we make
you're gonna swim not me but um yeah i'm gonna be unboxing this thing right there and um see you later
we can't wait to see what you can do next and we'll be with you every step of the way you're sincere
it's not going to lag anymore on that screen and now it's going to be a little bit more zippier on this device
it's a little bit more organized on the device and that way you could just put it right here all the games that i see
and then you're going to see an option on the device where you will be able to um my bad if you want to go activate the app tray
another thing that i like to do is add a vpn to my device so you might want to add one as well on yours
ads blocks trackers and all types of things and this is actually pretty um useful because it will protect your device from threats and outside um malicious activity
you're gonna see it does have um apps that can be removed to the sd card so in order to move your apps to the sd card
what you want to do is go to settings and then what you want to do is go to apps after you go to apps
lets you change it right here to the sd card and you can just go ahead and move call of duty mobile to the sd cards
and i think that's going to be cool because your wallpapers will change like pretty much every day which is sweet
another thing that this device does have is the kids mode so you can always turn on the kids mode on this device and pretty much
what that's going to do is um prevent like um you know it's going to give you the option to control the device as a parent
it's always password protected so they're not going to be able to get out of it once it's in that option so i think that's pretty cool as well
uh go ahead wait for it to load on the screen and um let me just wait for that to load
where the screen will only be landscape mode but there is an app called screen orientation control right here so you can hit it on auto right here
when i'm using the device but the last tip i wanted to show you guys was focus mode and basically when you have focus mode turn on it
i'm not sure if that has anything to do with the name but yes android 10 and a 10 inch screen inside it
but the tablet can also take an sd card so there is potential of expanding the internal storage with an sd card
the fact that the tablet's body is made out of metal typically for this price we get tablets that are made out of plastic and that feels somewhat cheap
it gets fairly bright and you can see it from any angle so great viewing angles as well so i have to say for a budget tablet
the screen does look better than most tablets that i've tried in the past at least budget friendly tablets that i've tried in the past inside it
we have a six thousand milliamp hour battery and that will keep the tablet running for between six to ten hours depending what you do with it
if you use facebook scrolling through your feed is done really good as well the same goes for chrome and instagram
i mean i was able to play call of duty of it which is somewhat graphic intensive and that one still works decent
so if you do plan on making video calls the quality from the front camera may not be the best out there
this is nice not to mention that the build quality overall is better than most tablets out there performance wise well for the price
it's got a 1.2 6 gigahertz processor running Android 51 lollipop and 8 gigs of storage expandable to 32 with the slot and 1 gig of ram
a USB port micro USB and it does have a front camera like it says it's 300k so those are the basic specs
but and i'm not going to show you the boot sequence and all that stuff because it's a little bit length you bet you know it's an Android tablet
I'm going to give it a four and it's gonna be losing the points therefore again Bluetooth and the RAM anyway
but you know, big let down for nighttime readers, such as myself, it is not temperature controllable as it is on some monochrome models.
Annex makes those too and while we're talking disappointments, I have to say I wish the Nova 3 Color had the physical appeal of some of its cousins.
On the software, Annex has built its own launcher for the Nova 3 Color a high contrast affair that rides a top Android 10.
In fact, you can tell it how fast you need it to be by putting it into one of three separate modes.
you don't want to do anything more taxing than flip a page every minute or so, but, crank it all the way up to A2 and suddenly
You don't buy an eReader so you can watch videos on it, you buy it for long stints of reading and writing.
Because it's Android you don't have to settle for the onboard bookstore, you just install kobo or Kendall or whatever app you keep your books in and run it.
Resolution is 300 DPI for black and white content, 100 DPI for color, and the digitizer supports just over 4,000 levels of pressure sensitivity
There's good palm rejection and very little input lag when writing on the Nova 3 Color, the stock note taking app is actually pretty fully featured.
Me, I like the navigation ball which sticks all those controls and more into a floating button you can just put it wherever you want.
And it's cool to be able to control speaker volume and display brightness by sliding my thumbs across the bezels here.
There's no headphone jack, but in addition to USB OTG the type C port on the bottom does support audio out or you can just use Bluetooth.
the device puts everything to sleep when you lock the screen even if you tell it to keep apps in memory.
Also the software tries to optimize contrast within apps by default, but, really all that does is put big ugly outlines around text.
So fortunately you can disable that on a per-app basis and even run different apps at different DPI settings if you need to.
And just keep in mind to run those third-party apps, you need to manually certify the device when you first set it up.
If it had just one fewer failing, if the front light could be set to warmer tones. - [Robotic Voice] Or if the microphone wasn't so squeaky.
This review was produced following 17 days with the Nova 3 Color review sample provided by Onyx International, but I don't produce paid reviews.
The company didn't provide compensation for, or receive any editorial input into this video, they're seeing it for the first time right alongside you.
and if you can't stay home and remember to stay safe and mask up when you're around others, as you stay mobile, my friends.
it's a micro usb so don't expect usb type c maybe it was a way amazon could save some money by making it a micro usb
i'm not sure another area where you can see that they try to save money on was the display is the display bad
1024 by 600 display and the viewing angles are really bad even the brightness levels on this tablet aren't very good
i mean i find myself keeping the tablet on maximum brightness most of the time because even then on maximum brightness
it's just not a really good audio quality if you're looking for a tablet for great audio experience don't expect much from this tablet the cameras
i guess it's good to have them if you're going to be doing some video calling but that's the only reason you should be using these cameras
and you're not gonna be able to even recognize it as an android tablet because it doesn't look nothing like another android tablet
it's going to have all of amazon services that means you won't be able to get any of google's applications which means no youtube
but it's not the official application from google and you can technically also side load google applications or other android applications
so it's good if you're looking to stream those applications you're going to find most of them on the amazon app store
this ui you have a home tab books tab and that's pretty much it there's no android customization like you're used to
it will allow you to really watch all the content you want read all the books you want and even play some of the games you want
we'll notify you when our new videos come out and thanks for watching and i'll see you on the next video you
it's super affordable price tag which goes down to as low as $100 to $110 this makes the 8 teclast p10 it's the in Amazon
calm however if you're still not convinced about getting the tablet then here is our comprehensive teclast pittin HD 10.1 Android tablet review to help
I will talk about the display the beaten HD comes with a 10.1 inch IPS display with 1920 x 1200 for each day resolution
now you might think that the pixel density is too low especially when considering this as a major focus device but unless you are comparing it to a higher
and make sure that you have a solid grip on the tablet as their screen lacks any sort of damage resistance class like Corning's Gorilla Glass
Amla you will have to make do with old and archaic methods of using pins and patterns to unlock your tablet and now we will talk about the performance
the tip last beaten eats the offers as well though out cocktail of hardware to ensure the best possible performance at a budget price point
in terms of storage the tablet comes with 32 gigabytes of space however only 22 gigabytes is available out of the box
tablets are notorious for having subpar cameras and the pit and HD is no different it has a 5mp rear camera paired with a 2 MP front shutter
plug-in for around 3 hours to get it fully charged from sir percent to 100 percent but respects 6,000 amides intelligent power management or 10
now just click the link below on the description box or you can shop on my website if you are in yet in united states you can click
abby and daddy daddy and daddy is going out and are going to play with my tablet and i broke it in the ground
yeah we'll have to link it where you can from watching movies and reading books to asking alexa for the weather
you can see from across the room um um you got this mostly for education yes you have to set it up after you get
they break so easy and the other plastic ones they get scratches so easy but this armor suit it's they put it on helicopters in the military
I'm going to take you through the actual controller and tablet and I'll give you my thoughts and feelings on it so let's get started inside the box
Android tablet it's currently running on an older version of jellybean but that is to be completely upgradable in the near future we then have the actual controller here
plug socket on there for you so you can take it abroad or depending on whether you live in the EU or Europe
works just like a normal tablet so even though this is designed to be bundled with the controller for games for a standalone tablet
PlayStation mobile we've got Tegra zone and envision as well as the Google Play Store to download a wide variety of mobile games on there
they are all games that you'll be able to use with the controller to have a better play experience but of course as an example
if you want to load up something like frozen which is essentially another version of the massive bejeweled frenzy that are on the App
I love the buttons although I feel like they could have been made at a bit of a higher quality a little bit
more like our next-gen buttons these are a little bit more like Xbox 360 buttons I prefer now more kind of rubberized finish buttons rather than plastic
it doesn't add much weight onto the device at all so it's not going to give you a crazy amount of arm ache or anything like that overall
you can't compare this to something like the Razer edge because the Razer edge can play PC games on a tablet
it's also nice to have that kind of additional tablet for gaming rather than using your phone wearing out your battery you know
your phone battery is really really good for something that costs just over 200 pounds getting there seven-inch completely functional tablet on its own plus the controller
I've really enjoyed playing that and I would definitely recommend and I'd also recommend you getting the wikipad because it is extremely fun since I've been reviewing it
I've been laying in bed in the mornings and evenings constantly playing it and wondering oh maybe I like mobile games a little bit more than I let on
so if this is something that you're interested in make sure to check it out considering the tablet and the controller the price is really really good as
I said their game library is ever-expanding and this is the best design of this kind of product I have ever seen
I hope I've covered everything that you would want from the design to how well it performs to the games you can play on it
the onyx books poke two color came out in 2020 with a limited run of a russian release it was sold out in hours
it was then on the back burner for a little bit and then was re-released in the form of a north american launch
so for the remainder of this video the six inch is the poke two color right here and of course the 7.8
but as long as you don't try to run too many applications at the same time you shouldn't notice significant performance issues
yeah we need to install some apps on it and and get it going to be connected to the internet first
download 27 megabytes update optimized the effective light sensitive brightness adjustment to optimize the application lock function 3 optimize lockscreen wallpaper for improved system stability
las t10 is its fingerprint sensor on the back position there now a lot of people said it it looks a funny place to put it but believe me
SD card tray if we just pull that out and you just pop your micro SD card in and an inserted I can see
that comes with this tablet if there is a charger included in the package contents on the on the website page
I can't think of another tablet that comes anywhere close in certainly in this price range or well in fact a lot more expensive
you can actually just play a video and listen to it at normal volume which is which is very very good
I've played it constantly with video playing and the eight-hour that be that it says in the specifications I it will easily exceed eight hours
no problem at all and even mixed-use you're looking at eight over eight hours just browsing the web and just general use
but that said it's a large tablet so it's not really as if you're gonna be out and about using this tablet for navigation so not a great issue
if you've enjoyed watching this little video then please subscribe to my channel and we'll see you for the next one bye
Wacom Bamboo fun for almost a decade and it started to really show the wear and tear so I was eager for the opportunity
I never felt like my hand was sticking against the surface nor did the pen nib feel like it was slowly grinding away and scratching at it
linework with this tablet was practically a religious experience the q11 K has 8,192 levels of pressure sensitivity compared to the 1,024 I was working with before
I feel like my hand and arm is running a marathon but big enough that I feel like I have a good amount of control
it's kind of silly but my old tablet was a very light silver and it would just get grimy looking with this and it's nice dark black color all
top-heavy it just falls right out this next one also affects you if you're like me and are used to you know
if you're not me and you know it's there and don't spend 20 minutes trying to figure out why you can't draw anymore
I'm going to do a review on the brand new walk them into is Pro medium so we've got some cool stuff to look at but before I do
so why don't we start with the tablet so one of the things that's surprising is that it's USBC which is great now as you can see
I've got all my dongles and everything from my new MacBook Pro here to make sure this is all connected but guess what don't need it
obviously you want to have it plugged in while it's charging up but then once it's fully charged it'll just run on the Bluetooth now
switch there where we can turn this on and off and if you want to pair it with the Bluetooth what you do
one of the nice things you can do here is a little hole and you can just go and pull it like that
let's just pull that off and what we can do is we can put different colors on a pin so say for example
see that little red band undo the front pull that out and just pop that in and then you can just put that over the top there and now
we've also got these on-screen controls so you know if you wanted to do something like maybe you want to go into brush tools
there's our brush tools and we can change our brush size up or down you can change a layer blend mode like that see
you can kind of control it here like you would a mouse a little bit standard gestures and he is a lot of the different types of gestures
there's a radio menu and that will give you other options to do there or you know you can choose here and you can see
because you can actually use these for a number of different things all right so let's have a look we're in Photoshop
so you'll see there's four different options there and each time you tap on there it cycles you can see there it shows you scroll
so you could do these things or you can go and you can change that and get it to do different things
you can do key strokes you can do all kinds of different things here with that touch ring and then of course on-screen controls
we've kind of already looked at a little bit anyway without making this a full toriel because i do have lots of tutorials on the
Wacom tablets here at Photoshop cafe that are done by myself and by Wes Maggio but so they actually been doing this title for over a decade together
here is just more of a review and so what do I think about this so I got to tell you it feels really nice
this is great and I always do recommend the tablets because you know if there's one tool you want to get when you're working in Photoshop
if you liked this video become part of the cafe crew hit that subscribe button right now smash that like button and also add a comment
it is my entirely honest opinion however both money is going to come into this a lot more because it was my own money that I spent on this
these are the set up leads and here you can also see the Mac adapter and normally an older Mac will have to buy in your adapter
this is the plug adapter that comes with the set it contains one USB charger and any set of pins you can slot in depending on your country here
I thought this was quite funny as it's actually a really useful design for keeping your pen with you and moving it where
then you plug it in to your power adapter with whatever pins you need for your country and you put this into the wall
I've reviewed earlier boasts 8,192 levels of pen pressure unlike the DEET tablet because it is a screen display it also boasts a full HD display resolution
unlike the exp pen which only had a 1280 by 720 resolution if I remember correctly meanwhile this has 1920 by 1080
which is always a plus because having worked of a battery-powered stylus in the past they can be a pain unfortunately
the problem I had was every time I set up a display recording whenever I used the control Z button to undo it
I made last time to test out the Veeck tablet and overall despite this small driver hiccup I had I was incredibly happy
with this tablet's performance the enhanced level of hand pressure works brilliantly without this tablet but not only does it now have a full
because obviously we've all worked her pencils have erasers on the back and being able to rotate my pen to get this was brilliant
but if you're ever looking for a decent reliable screen tablet in my experience extra pens definitely the way to go my artist
who wants to get them to have their hands on a new piece of care or for anyone who's under budget this thing performs fantastically and my artist
I definitely believed it's a worthwhile investment and even though it doesn't come with a stand I actually have a one pound stand that I bought from
it's actually nine point six inches just so you don't get upset about that missing four tenths of an inch has 16 gig it supports
Direct TV so you can get all sorts of live television and obviously there's so many things like Netflix and Hulu and ABC on-demand and Amazon video
that is a lot of movies even at Full HD quality a lot of movies and music and TV series and whatever else content
but certainly quite capable enough for the majority of what you'd use it for it is a quad-core CPU from Qualcomm and has cameras
it's actually like a really huge cell phone so the camera in the back features a 5 megapixel camera lens and a 4 x digital zoom
it does give you a huge view screen so if you have some issues with vision this actually can be a huge boon
it's 199 dollars 199 bucks and that includes the Wi-Fi 3G 16 gig of built-in memory and obviously expandability through the microSD
ok quick look at the ports but it's not very clear but I'm going to still try my best power button volume rocker camera windows key on this side
uh it's been a long time though and dragontouch actually got a hold of me and asked me if i'd be willing to show this on my channel
now it's a 2018 model so it's technically not that anymore but um this i think runs 139 on on amazon right now so in all reality
tablets um the the a little bit nicer in that video but in those lower and more price conscious brands right
um so that's all the information that's on that um but this is the tablet itself so we have the screen
i understand that but it is nowhere near the power performance that a 5th gen ipad has um you know single cores
3. they all have similar benchmarks to this guy see at least in single core multi-cores up and down in those
it's not gonna kind of perform as good as some of the more expensive stuff out there um but for 140 bucks
thanks for sticking by to the end and we'll catch you back here for a future video review right here on techgooch
honeywell finally having a tablet for years and we do have one and uh it goes along with the rest of our product line
have you been able to work with it or i have a matter of fact i was uh very impressed that it's number one
it's a 10-inch tablet that's both windows and android like jeff mentioned so you have the choice of either the flex range imager is the
so if you want to check them out you can visit the links in the video description below so this time
there are six physical shortcut buttons it supports Levin right-handed use and this is suitable for use on Mac and Windows
if you want to prevent all from your fingers or hand to go onto the tablet you can use the glue and here
I'm not sure about the exact pricing because sometimes the vary depending on where you buy it but for price or budget tablet
this is the scroll wheel which you can assign to certain functions for example we can use this to screw webpages use these to increase
and this is the cover which you can select open very easily to review the battery and USB wireless receiver battery life is rated at 16 hours
so let's see what we can change here so you can find functions through the two side buttons here you change the pressure sensitivity
I'm going to map to 100% of the resolution of my monitor and you can also determine how much area on the tablet you want to use
to change the brush size this is how the light indicators will look like when the tablet is switched on when you hover on the drawing area
this is the wireless signal and when the battery is low this will light up so you know when to charge it
I mean zoom in to let you see how smooth the strokes are this is at 400% zoom and the strokes
you are not going to get in and fix looks like this this is MIDI Bank paint Pro pressure sensitivity works very well here by the way
I am NOT able to translate a graphic software out there but for those that I have used photos that I've shown you earlier
look it even tells you what it comes with with the tablet a pen a little bag comes with a cute little glove
oh it's this is a bag the holder we got a bunch the wires and attend some setup instructions and the most important part everyone the glove
I guess that's what you want if it's gonna hold you tablet so now that I've looked over everything let's go ahead and set it up alright
he's very adorable which you will see at the very end of this video so first off the setup was super comfortable
I would hold down that button when I want to erase and I erase wait and then when I let go
if you you have to like press the button and then erase and then press it again when you want to switch back to pen mode
I know a lot of people use it but I just like moving around the screen with the with the pan ability with my old pen
I would struggle really hard with figuring out calibrating where the line should be versus lovely crap how it houses the pen was not drawing on the display where
this screen is not as bright as I wanted it to be and also the contrast is not as high as I want it to be either
I'm working with an iMac with a 5k display so I'm kind of spoiled with what how many pixels I can work with so go into this display
the nice thing about it is you can actually see where your pen is going when you want to draw on the screen
I often would be looking up at the IMAX screen to reference colors so I think that is a pretty big drawback to this tablet
oh and for this character the way that he pitched it to me was he wanted a caribou that was light blue and light pink with white so
I was just struggling with some of my brushes earlier but I think the shading was like the most fun part yeah
so as far as this review goes they asked for me to be pretty critical about how I feel about their products
just give you an honest review of what I think about this tablet and whether or not you should get it and whether or not it's worth the money
OS switch the quad core processor sufficiently powers either operating system and makes the interface responsive and snappy windows apps load quickly and android games such as subway surfers
it may be a little small for using desktop mode in Windows but the tablet has built-in Bluetooth which allows you to easily connect the Bluetooth keyboard and mouse
the camera on the device isn't the best but it can come in handy in a pinch or if you need to make a quick
I'm happy that this one tablet can run both my windows programs and my Android apps the tablet performs well and it's great for basic gaming and web browsing
because i've been using this tablet for a while and one day i woke up and i couldn't find my pen and to my belief
thank you xd pen now like i said i have been using this tablet for a couple weeks now and i'm really loving it
is it something that you probably just give to your kids or can it take on more intensive tasks like photo editing or more intensive gaming
make sure you stay tuned to the end for the pros and cons as well as other options to consider at this price point
the s30 runs Android PI 9 which means a 0 bloatware unlike the Kindle Fires which are always rammed with tons of Amazon related software
it's lacking in brightness quite considerably when compared to my iPhone 10 which you can see in the corner of the screen both which are at 100% brightness
you can clearly see that the S 30 really is lacking that not only means that viewing angles are pretty limited
but unless you're sitting in a dimly lit room you're constantly going to see a reflection of yourself whilst using it which whilst
Skype or zoom call but certainly nothing worth using for any photos that you actually care about but it has to be said
things are pretty average with anywhere from 5 to 10 hours of battery life of course depending on how intensive your usage is
let's talk performance during more intensive tasks like gaming as well as photo editing and moderately intensive tasks like when watching Netflix or YouTube
but before we dive into it make sure you're subscribed for tons more of my budget tech reviews and don't forget to follow me on Instagram for Photoshop
if you're just looking to kill some time however photo editing and anything remotely creative on the s30 is where it really struggles
wise the only time it struggles is if say you're installing an app or updating a large app in the background which can make playback stutter other than that
ebooks listening to your podcasts through wired headphones wireless headphones watching YouTube and Netflix gaming as well as facilitating Skype video calls with decent quality
the pros are great performance during gaming surprisingly and everyday tasks of course a decent camera compared to other options at the same price
now that you've watched this video you might want to check out my review of the best-selling true wireless earbuds on Amazon
the pen included with this tablet has two buttons which can be set to many different functions near the eraser of the pen
this ring can be changed to a different color and a blue and a black ring are included in the package
I have Mac OS 10 and I did need to install a driver from the Wacom website starting in the tablet menu this menu
the mapping menu allows you to set the tablet in either pen or Mouse mode and set the screen and tablet areas in the touch options menu
the standard gestures menu allows you to set whether you want certain gestures on or off that come included with the tablet
YouTube channel as well as like this video if you enjoyed it and I'll see you guys in the next one
the protective case on it makes it really easy to hold and then also on the other side there is a ring here which makes it easy to carry
they're not going to drop it but also it is for a stand so they can prop it up but one thing that i really like about it
it has tons of games on it for them to choose from and it just takes a minute to load from my internet connection there
we go but there's a lot of different choices for them in the games area once they're done there there's a camera they can do
they can do videos or there's a painting app where they can color different pictures and choose whatever pages that they want so
i really like that safety feature where it's age appropriate for them and then also we have let me exit out here
please click the subscribe button and also the notification bell because I don't want you to miss out on any of my future videos
there's a card from the company directing you on how you can share your public experience and also for customer service support
included is a Quick Start Guide a USB micro charging cable and the user manual and in case you're wondering there is no charging adapter included with this unit
I believe you will notice when it's in your hands is how lightweight the tablet feels weighing in at 0.7 pounds
I say this device is lightweight it really is like again its weighs in at 0.7 pounds larger than my Amazon tablet yet lighter
I can easily slip it in and out of my tech bag and launch some of my favorite apps like Netflix and YouTube
not sure how well you can see this but this is the memory card right here and if you have any nails you're not getting in there
I think that's really my only complaint so far with this budget tablet of course if you swipe down these are your you swipe down
and of course your settings here standard studying display schedule power on/off navigation bar audio profiles storage security location accounts accessibility digital well being in parental controls
this is a budget tablet and at least it does have a speaker right alright so check it out so for better sound quality
I highly recommend taking advantage of the headphone jack or just connect a pair of bluetooth headphones as I mentioned earlier
well they're okay but if you listen carefully you'll hear a strange annoying sound in your video when it focuses on an object so my final thoughts well honestly
have those high-end tablets and I have them too but I am very impressed with the venko matrix pad si and yes
I do recommend this for anyone who is in the market for a tablet that's affordable great for streaming movies browsing the web email and some games
there's been a price cut so you can pick up one of these tablets on Amazon for $89.99 I will leave my Amazon affiliate link in the description
please be sure to connect with me on social media subscribe to the texting 360 youtube channel and drop me some comments
tell me about what makes your favorite tablets stay safe and I will see you in my very next video thank you you
at the first glance i would sure wish for the other tablets to have this kind of packaging in the future because for me it looks eco-friendly
if you are still starting on digital art you can buy the tablet on gammon's website or even on amazon links down in the description
you could set it all up and you're done all of these took half of the video but anyways let's get straight on to it anyways
just reminding you guys so you don't have to remind me yes but even after all of this i used to hide that fact from anyone
and then they would all be flustered about it and squealed the fact that anonymous people would squeal about this funny man
i haven't done anything that would add up to the fangirlness like drawing a character with sans yet so time skip
the school year is almost done our school year here in my country philippines usually ends at february or march and this takes place at december
some teachers actually said that they are actually really good at speaking in english and warned us if we want to talk to them
i remember when we all greet each other but and even spell like tummy in texts so anyway back from back to the topic sans that dumb yet
even though i could see in their face that they could be judging so basically i made comics that were inspired by fanfics
just you could find find fano x sans and wattpad and you'll you'll find what you're trying to find um yes
you know what i say when i show it to them shows picture of fano and sand smooching my my friend would go on
i would draw fanno and sans doing the thing so like insert ok hand and point left emoji and i would say my cousin dared me to do this
they're my cousin and i would talk to myself through that account and i would even do something like my cousin
jokingly hacked my account and spammed and posted sans pictures on my gallery and i did this for a few months though
I wanted to use my finger as the mouse I could use it within the active area which is approximately about 4 by 6 inches
I also have this ring for changing the brush size so if I press down the circle here you can see as I scroll through what I have
I've got different functions set up for the actual touch screen itself so one is just like double-clicking and it's like dragging and holding your mouse down for up
I have a setup as far as the gestures my gestures tap and hold brings up the radial menu like you just saw four fingers up
it's pretty simple just like pretty much using a mouse if I used a single finger it's just like using the mouse around
I think it's the creator capture whichever ones the highest line and the bamboo series but I think with the features that this one offers
it's worth the extra money to go with this one instead so again this is Mark Warren from Mark Warren photography
if you have any questions again feel free to just put them in comments and I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible
of course this unboxing is a little bit of a dramatization because I've already opened this and have been using it for the better part of a month
I'm gonna go ahead and point out that this tablet comes with a screen protector pre-installed which is awesome typically when you remove these little
all of your own so this little guy is already starting off with bonus points now underneath the tablet what you have is the user manual an additional
Quick Start Guide as well as a micro USB cable for both charging and transferring data and while those accessories are all well and good
right hand corner now while there isn't anything on the left-hand side or the bottom of the tablet on the right-hand side
I tried out a few others previously and I swear the runtime on one of the movies I was watching was increased by a good 30 minutes
Night of the Living Dead yes the original Night of the Living Dead is indeed in the public domain and has been so since the day it was released
an old black-and-white movie is not going to give you a good idea on what kind of video quality you can get out of this thing so
Sudoku and even hidden object games which I'm gonna go ahead and admit are a guilty pleasure of mine however for the sake of this video
that's been out of print since the 90s now while it is true that the maximum video resolution on the Matrix pad s7 is 720p
let's swap cameras and I bet you thought I was going to be focusing on my face for this part but not quite
I'm not gonna be doing a face reveal just yet the main thing I wanted to show you was the maximum resolution of the front-facing camera
the HP Elite x2 1030 g3 is a tablet with a difference that difference being power the power of a laptop
make it the perfect partner for anyone with a design background but just what else does this device have to offer
let's take a look and find out visually the HP elite follows the same stylish minimalist design as with all recent
HP's giving it an air of class and sophistication perfect for any business man or woman or just general enthusiasts in comparison to other two-in-one devices
we have reviewed the HP Lea is much smaller and more travel friendly weighing in at one point one seven kilograms or just 0.82 kilograms for the tablet alone
it's lightweight yet sturdy and has an air of reliability about it proving to be in my opinion better than that the Microsoft Surface go typing on
HP elite is the HP active pen though this does come at an additional cost and is not included in the bundle unlike the travel keyboard
HP's sure view for added security making a device first detachable PC with an integrated privacy screen with all grown concerns over security
HP devices in terms of battery life the HP lex-2 1030 g3 claimants to last around 10.5 hours but with general use
which for a tablet isn't perhaps as impressive as it could be but for a business device or laptop is as expected
I love its sturdy design and easy attachment attach options making this device the perfect companion for an aforementioned designer crowd
pounds 80 on the HP store but given the chance this stylish little two-in-one could become your new business traveling companion and you would not be disappointed
I've got with me the motion r12 which is a brand new tablet from the folks over in Austin Texas from ocean computing
it's a rugged tablet as you can see by the sort of tough looking design but it's a 12 inch screen
there's even a charging station where you can put five tablets flat directly into the charging station and lock them up
I'm not going to take this one out because it's on the pre-production unit but basically it's just a matter of flipping that little connector there
put that in and basically you don't have to even turn the Machine off you don't even have to put it in there to sleep
4G SIM card slot there so those features that are built into the tablet which is great and next to that we have something that I really rate
I can tether the pen to the tablet so that you don't lose it and that's a feature that's really lacking in a lot of tablets these days with
Windows 8 which is a really great operating system for this tablet nice and fast and fluid really takes advantage of the touch features of the tablet
Windows 7 on this tablet it will support Windows 7 which is good but having this Intel Core i5 or i7 processor power at your fingertips
that's the fourth generation of that that processor on a device like this makes it a really productive device but especially with Windows 8
now you can see here that the motion r12 has a high resolution 1920 by 1080 screen for this size screen 12 inches
Wacom digitizer system is that you can lean your hand on the screen like this because when the pens in range of the screen it turns touch off
I touch the screen and it automatically switches between pen and touch so it makes the the writing experience really part 9
we've got a lot of area to work with but you know if I'm writing something across the screen over here then
it's something that you could use for an extended period of time because it's nice and thick and easy to hold so
he's actually quite important because there's bleed so many times when I've had the tablet in my hand and I've actually dropped it
that's behind me has had a couple of hits on the road and those sorts of things and with a rugged device
I know that it's going to survive even those sorts of things on a daily basis which is really really important to me
PC comm that I use so give us a call and as I said we can arrange a demonstration for you of the r12 on-site anywhere in Australia
Paul here and today I'm gonna be doing a review of this tablet this is the Asus memo pad HD 7
I saw that it is basically like a first gen Nexus 7 with some upgrades to it so that was pretty compelling for me and 450 bucks
the route case pretty much comes with the plastic covering he's dead and their case itself and that's pretty much gonna wrap it up for my root case review
this is just a pretty decent quality a little cover protection cover and stand and it's way way cheaper than the
Nexus 7 you get 16 gigabytes of integrated storage and you get a micro USB slot and that was absent on the first gen Nexus 7 so
I mean not the favorite but again for simple tasks that I've been using it for even for streaming video it's been just fine also
they're a little bit difficult to reach at times but again it's passable so not too many problems with that you get stereo speakers
so if you are wanting to multitask on your tablet floating apps and widgets can kind of give you a simpler way to do that what
you can use it to schedule recordings and it's much easier to do than using just a simple mouse or even the directional interface with the remote and then
I can pull up my shared spreadsheet for example where I store all of my benchmarks and it makes a really easy way to do data entry
well like film videos from time to time or reading off notes while I film videos so also a pretty useful there
I would give it a seven but I'm gonna bump it up to an eight because the screen is so nice again
this is not quite the same display quality is like the new Nexus 7 but equal or better than the old Nexus 7 so very nice screen quality
it's nothing that I've not encountered with just about any Android devices that I've tried to use here and there but you will notice
this doesn't have the top-of-the-line processor so it's not going to be quite as buttery smooth but again for just basically browsing everything totally fine and nothing that
it's got a 15 watt hour battery and I've found that it will easily last two to three or even more days than that with light or medium use
but that's what's pretty random is only using in an evening or whatever if you are using it continuously you can expect about eight hours
I give it a nine for value which gives it an overall score of eight and and I might be refining my scoring methods here in the future
but that's what we'll finish on and overall score of eight so again totally acceptable and adequate and I'd say quite nice for everything I've bought it for
I'm very happy with my purchase so far and this has been a fantastic tablet for me and it's pretty much done everything
it's a little bit clunky unless you detach the keyboard and hold it in your hands which is something that you do
so let's take a quick look at some of the hardware here and then we'll talk a little bit about what you can do in software
I didn't close this up to show you and power USB 3.0 USB 3.1 type-c connector and a headset jack and that's pretty much it for the porch
there's also a microphone here at the top and then on the front we've got a 2 megapixel camera and stereo speakers which are reasonably loud power
but you're probably not going to get seven or eight hours very often and four hours depending on what is it
sort of like an all-in-one desktop style computer here if you wanted to run some apps like Netflix which works just fine so you can watch videos on it
I did notice at first that when you push down on the center it it sort of flexes a little bit
I got used to that pretty quickly and and I found that the full-size keys are pretty easy to type on one thing
there's just a lot of things that our end screen brightness a lot of things that are crammed into the space where you'd normally expect to find
I've got a high resolution display so it sort of scales it up to make it easy to see it doesn't and likewise these little toolbars over here
I'm gonna go play with that instead has Intel HD graphics not discreet Nvidia or AMD graphics but with the resolution set to 1600 by 900 and graphics
I'm going to show you because you only need to see me embarrass myself at a game that I barely not play or how to exit
so that's a look at some of the things that you can do with this tablet as I mentioned at 2 pounds
but if you're treating it as a laptop first the way that Acer recommends I think it's a pretty nice device now
if you're looking for something with really long battery life then maybe you want to look elsewhere but for $5.99 and up
you've got a two pound tablet you can also just sort of fold it behind the screen for out-of-the-way usage here or protect the screen by folding it
Acer switch alpha 12 for gaming for web browsing for pretty much anything that you would ever want to do with a
let's go ahead and see if we can find a 1440p video that will take full advantage of the screen and for copyright issues
now you get a lot of accessories a lot of uh features built into this tablet and it's only worth 120 pound uk currency now
now here you go at the stylus here and then you will also get a usb type-c charging cable for this tablet
so you've got all the basic things that android will have okay so connected devices got bluetooth to connect your bluetooth devices
now the rest of the things are basically just how a android smartphone would have so exactly the same thing out there
so with the rear camera the rear camera it has a built-in 8 megapixel and the front camera is a 5 megapixel it has a built-in 2.4
gigahertz wifi band with a built-in bluetooth 4.0 it has a built-in mic as well loudspeaker gps android 9.0 software built into this and it takes double sim cards
it's saying meh pixel so you can't really expect much the fact that he has a camera and you can do video calls and stuff
there's a little sheet on top of the serving into the first before actually playing on it and on the back
and we'll leave this in the link in the description down below so please go check it out alright so first
oh look at this video by the way we have a huge giveaway see so we have a huge 20k giveaway so make sure to join that

iPad so these hold the home button or go to the app turn on oh let's try out the Google feature hit Search Gavin Jesse
hello in this video i will be giving my pure unadulterated opinion on the huion canvas with a k at 22 plus in previous review videos
i usually go over the setup process of the tablets but i realized that that's absolutely useless because they come with instructions
okay so i have words to say in the video um so today chat we will be uh making a short animation with the queen canvas 22
drawing tablet has a mere 13.5 inch screen so for me to draw on something so large was a very welcome change
but this is one of the reasons i wouldn't personally use it as my go-to tablet because i prefer higher resolution screens for drawing
it felt very nice to draw on because the etched glass gives it some resistance so it mimics the feeling of drawing on paper pretty well
i say partially disabled because it would only stop me from typing characters for example if i were to change the canvas size or manually set the magnifier wait
i'll split it into pros cons and meh for the things that i'm indifferent about and it really depends on your personal preference for the pros
if you want to check it out i will put a link in the description as well as links to the tablet

the bezels are rather important on each of the four sides but this may be a blessing in disguise since it provides enough room to rest your hands
also it is not very bothersome particularly since the bezel dimensions are symmetrical on either side in terms of the ports
so it's no surprise that the company chose to bring a 10.1 inch full hd 1920x1200 ips lcd screen on the unit
and they're exactly how you could envision under average the back and front cameras appear to get a comparable quality with graphics lacking details and colors
you might take a few decent shots when it's s very important but understand that you just won't be amazed concerning connectivity
i'll be reviewing stuff and it's my very first review and it's a this little item here which is a Busby 7-inch android 4.0
now this was picked up for the parenthesis son 4799 delivered on ebuy calm and I ultimately so I'm going to do an unboxing
one is for almost five and one is six almost seven and we're going on holiday fairly soon and we need something to keep them amused on the plane
sir that's actually quite low for a 7-inch tablet however when you're sick she probably won't notice this is its android 4.0
megapixel front-facing camera hang on whoop-dee-doo why do I suppose it's good to have such a high resolution camera on a tablet into a child
then they don't really get these by the way so i bought a screen protector 16 gig card and these very hideous fake leather fake leather case
that's your lot and the front of the box which features some very busy bees which I imagine is a play on word with busy bee
charged it at least when the battery has been totally drained please charge the busby 7 for at least five minutes before
powering the tablet so it won't turn on if it hasn't gone e battery what we have here absolutely useless bunch of instructions but let's be honest
drive oh really tell me we recognize the USB Drive not supplied which can be attached to the tablet bad supplied USB cable adapter
I've it's the power supply because otherwise we're in pretty poor shape so we let him what we got a plug in the wall USB adapter okay
USB cable I think yes anybody who's had a blackberry and had to throw it in the bin because is absolutely crap
you can use things like keyboards with this but not tried and trying to take the portability aspect out if you ask me so where
first impressions got a bit of weight to it but not too much and oh here we go so it's uh hello
we've got the micro USB micro SD card slot not sure that is probably some sort of speaker and along this edge
maybe oh there's things here to let us know that they are actually power plus or minus for the volume and back or return button
I think what we do is a little power on see how quickly comes up and I think what we do is turn the light hours wattages
so i've moved one of those and I've got the only important one that left bar but I have to say it's not fantastic
when you consider that my dell streak here actually has don't know if you can see there a considerable amount more signal there's picking up don't
no it's clocking lot or find sometimes these android devices they can have a really fast connection to Wi-Fi however when you and no they periodically pause
you want to buy stuff from google will add it but will st. not now and because i can't be bothered
is that when you're at the optimum angle but seeing your own face you sort of not the best viewing angle to actually see the screen
anyway you've got a video camera option as well so you could video yourself here and we're videoing ourselves here now
let's try some hangar birds now as I mentioned earlier this free itself isn't that high resolution but but to say it holds up pretty well
it with headphones sounds great gallery here and sure you can go in and see some films however this is probably get shot by youtube for this
oh by the way the colors slightly off on the camera because the white balance is off for the luminescence method of the screen
if you do have any questions about this budget tablet then feel free to pop the questions down there okay and
think that x1 nano so that means it can go from 7 to 15 watts but like the x1 nano the performance
this is going to be one of the things that most people are interested in who don't like surface type covers
it's a white backlit keyboard by the way and it connects via the pogo pin and gets power that way so no bluetooth no power
yeah it's not exactly completely full-sized obviously though so that's the only concession here but it's not really tiny it's fine
usually these kinds of tablets are not the most upgradeable you can get it with 8 or 16 gigs of ddr4 low powered ram
it passed a bunch of mil-spec tests it's a magnesium alloy casing and the display is covered with gorilla glass five
that's 65 bucks which is a lot cheaper actually than some of the competition like microsoft surface pens which are usually around 100 this basic pen
it's absolutely pretty good in terms of performance and you can see from the benchmarks that it does pretty well for something this tiny so about battery life then
i mean if you push it a little harder with the power saving technology you might even get longer on it
it's there mostly probably for vertical marking folks like insurance adjusters who need to take pictures of auto damage or something like that
but i think it's perfectly adequate and you've got a pen in the box and you've got really a nice keyboard in the box

I'll bet one day they're going to take the guts out of one of those and use them to make a tablet PC
now get to work on next week's lottery numbers yes indeed it is a Windows 7 based tablet PC thing that we're looking at today
I noticed when pulling this out of the box apart from the reflection of my lovely faith is that yes it's far better built than the other
you've got a rocker switch which uses as a plus and minus volume type thing and also it will raise and lower the brightness of the screen
I haven't quite figured out when it changes from volumes of brightness seemingly when it feels like it but I'm sure I'm missing something as usual on this side
HDMI USB on the other side we have another USB headphones and a little switch to toggle wireless on and off and something
I've saved you the infinite joy of watching its startup and must be said though I was expecting a full operating system for a desktop like Windows
it's a bit basic is one way of putting it it's works but I don't know it's not exactly full-featured they're currently working on a fart
um you can drag little boxes to select multiple things and all that kind of thing as you would expect if you want to right
well you plug in a USB keyboard not really right let's try get something up on the Internet's I don't bum Firefox
that's bizarre automatically comes up with something but don't worry we can force it by sliding out that thing at the side
there's let's face it if you probably going to spend a lot of time watching videos or something up on the train
what we really wanted was a something like one of the ion or ion to chips which would massively enhance video encoding in that but there we go
I just made for my terrible old games internet series and this be the first time it's ever been shown yes
and if you try and play 1080p through it welcome to slideshows city so yeah not not exactly ideal for portable video
it's just kind of about three hours no matter what you're doing which is makes things easier for calculating battery life
it's just a basic webcam really in the does a sort of half decent job and so does the microphone on board
you know it's good enough to Skype people with I suppose if you are a Skype er which has been like a Sciver on the online right next thing
PC concept during the rounds called the Microsoft courier and it's like some folding book thing that never existed they never solve really developed it that far
is you can lasso parts of it and then select them however it does seem to be a ludicrously slow lasso
Victorine then you can sort of move it around and do whatever which is quite clever but I have no idea why it takes so long to select there
all the backgrounds gone all red because it's been focused on screen so long and comparing it to the ipad array is
yes indeed anything tablet shaped has to be compared to the iPad by law or policeman comes around and smashes your knees with a special hammer
I you can install and use almost anything whereas an iOS you can install and use almost nothing also of course getting data on and off
when this new version of tablet friendly windows 7 comes out that will depend of course on take-up from people who write software but of course again
rumors are looking at twice the resolution and it flies and you know cures athlete's foot and everything else like that
then you probably could do with one of those and if you've watched it and thought what a complete waste of time
because they're the one he's got has only got the 16 gig of on-board storage so he wouldn't be able to seed many roms
by six point two five inches it supports 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity and resolution is slightly over 5,000 lines per inch resolution
so you can actually hold where y'all stallers above the tablet without touching the tablet and the distance of that hovering is about 1 cm
so you have to activate them by using the stylus but here you use your fingers and for this new model
these are the cables so this is the charging cable for the pan the pan has battery built-in but does need to be charged
I can put a pen on top and this is the USB cable for the tablet and it plugs in like this so it goes like this now
you can set the functions to the first and second buttons on the pen itself there is a slider where I can set the pressure sensitivity of the pen
I have set my pen pressure to be a bit steeper so that I need to press down a bit harder to get a thicker stroke
that indicates left hand and I think that's about all you can also set the screen ratio if you want to I map the whole
this is the one that you should click on to uninstall that we on tablet so it doesn't go by that we on name
Wacom tablet so it's a more gradual taper but while we on strokes I find that they don't taper as smoothly so oops yes again
I think this software they use themself software correction to make yorkers even smoother even to taper even more gradually so this is a very nice sketching software
I'm going to do the same sort of test pen pressure books well - and the lines are very responsive this is version 10 of MIDI Bank pin
I whenever i pose reviews of tablets like these there will be people who want to see how it performs on software like critter or king - sigh
I mean it works with pen pressure so you get thin and thick lines even though the variation is quite limited so this is Wacom Bamboo paper
the only issue that I have with this is in Photoshop and sketchbook for thick papering strokes they they doin taper that gradually
I did not show you any demonstrations on the Mac because this tablet works perfectly on the Mac so I don't want to waste extra time on that
10 to show you the performance and features on this $140 Android tablet. It's equipped with an 8 core processor, 32 gigs of storage
The Max 10 also has an internal FM tuner and it requires wired headphones to be plugged in for it to work.

also if you really get interested in this product check the description and get a big discount that will until 14 february
just run the program as an administrator and then restart your computer and it's done if you don't know how to deal with some stuff just use a manual
if you are using the round button you will get a backline so do not use it while you are trying
i hope you like this video and it would be good to share this to someone by searching for graphic doubled
i also prepared for use a speed paint so i hope you will enjoy it and you like to find new art for now bye so you
if you're doing everything that i just said that i was doing like you're trying to create if you're trying to do a little bit of cat or whatever
because i threw you printed some of these little brackets and it holds it up nice it's got 256 gigabytes 16 gigabytes of ram
i suggest getting one i recommend but you want to probably have another fan on deck to try to keep it cool
they're pretty loud and it's not bad so yeah this is a video here and yeah that the videos aren't too bad to watch gaming on here it's okay
I haven't really been keeping track of the competitor brands aside from Wacom and also it really depends on the kind of art that you're doing
the company reached out to me recently and was kind enough to send me the tablets to try out aside from these two gham on
we'll also be releasing a monitor type tablet where you can draw directly on the tablet with the stylus but for now
osoo but can totally function as a drawing tablet it has your 2048 levels of pressure pretty standard 10 millimeters of reading height
they've lasted me about 4 to 6 months of use before needing replacement just go to unscrew the pen and make sure the battery is in correctly
all that's left is to attach the cable from the tablet to your computer's USB port and Here I am pretending like I'm drawing something and now here
I like to test is slowly drawing a line and see how how well it actually follows the path some pens
it would adjust the work area to match the ratio of your monitor so right now if I were to apply this it'll it'll take out the bottom
I'm following the grid and it's actually a square as opposed to last time where it was a rectangle so make sure to do that
I try to draw a circle and it would just keep I could just keep drawing an oval and that kind of fixes it okay so what
I'm comfortable drawing the most which is my character and based on how well or how quickly I can do it without you know
I'd say maybe upgrade to something else probably the the was it the m106 which i'll be covering in a bit but i'd say for a beginner tablet
but you know it's still got the job done if I worked on this tablet much more regularly I would definitely you know
it's flexible so I don't have to worry about it shattering and in my bag or wherever I decide to take it yeah it works
what's up everybody that ratio welcoming you back into another video and in today's video we are going to have a look into this
asking you are you happy with the product or not on multi language supporting user guide explaining each and everything about the product in here
one leaflet explaining all the buttons around your tablet on micro USB charging cable now in last but not least we have a matrix s8 Android tablet
now this is very much an obviously clear from the design side that yong-ki had put a lot of effort into its build quality
now let's go into the settings of the tablet where we're going to see the hardware specifications what they are now this matrix s8 tablet is running
I know it's a bit old but suitable and a backward compatible you can use it with all the devices with supporting Bluetooth
let's go ahead and check out the video performance of this tablet by playing some videos from YouTube to get an idea
you can use it using this application or if you have a Skype or or say what's up or anything like that
I usually don't play much of the games at all but just to prove the point that this tablet can handle the games very easily
the reason video was working very good on the tablet is because the tablet can hold this all very nicely and that's a good thing
seven inch tablet with a 2048 by 1536 pixel display it has an Intel Atom Bay Trail processor 2 gigabytes of RAM 32 gigabytes of storage and
Android now it's got access to all of your sort of regular Android applications and you've got access to the full Google Play Store just off the bat here
it is a sharp good-looking screen that works well for videos pictures etc and also for gaming so it works pretty well
I used it a lot for reading and playing and watching things in Android because I think that operating system works well for it
we can run it in full screen again the Wi-Fi is faster and other rooms in my house than it is here
I could do multiple windows side-by-side and so you have access to running sort of a more desktop style environment than you would in Android
also the way memory is managed is different so even if you do a lot of multitasking and Android after a while
I have to refresh browser tabs or other applications in the background when you when you put them back in focus because it doesn't keep them in focus
we can watch in full screen now in terms of performance as I mentioned when running Android it performs about it the way I would expect it
it comes closer to something like a core i3 has well based system so it's been pretty pleasant to use now it does have only two gigabytes of RAM
I read about it and put that in this window and this is to show that different windows apps treat DPI or dots per inch scaling differently
it's almost too small to use now if you really wanted extra space because as you might have noticed here we go
it almost looks like you're running to smart phone apps next to each other so if you really want to shrink things
the second two largest setting is a little bit better and so if you really wanted things to look a little bit more visible then you know
that's not a lot of room for applications and and media and other things so only about 10 gigs free here about 4 gigs free and Android
that's sort of one of the downsides of having this dual OS system where you're trying to cram both operating systems into a small device
neither one's really high quality but you can take pictures or do video chat and a speaker here which is nuts
it's not super loud but it's not it doesn't have a lot of base but it works ok for basic usage
it's got a great price and it sells sells for about two hundred dollars it's available in China but you can buy it from geek
what's possible with dual operating systems if you know which operating system you want and you only want that one but
I don't feel like editing that back into the reviews all this places at the end this is Brad Linder with Lola buting and a look at the cube
Windows and in order to switch operating systems and Android you just pulled from down from the top and clicked OS switch here
on a brand new powerful ten core Android tablet with a full HD screen supports 4G SIM cards Android version seven
so there is quite a substantial five thousand milliamp battery so you can expect to achieve around up to eight hours of battery life
Android tablets and seeing how they compare with each other all devices have been ranked by an teachers scores so as you can see the Valle I ate
you can view all my charts online at chick's tech comm and read them at your leisure so there you have it guys that was the new
max so let's break it down with some pros and cons so you have a slim and light 10 inch tablet which handled everything
on that full HD IPS display the kickstand is also very useful and I love the added benefit of 4G SIM card support
kind of leaving those strokes with blocky ends instead of tapering them off as it should when the pressure sensitivity is working
this is mostly me because I was getting used to using an on-screen tablet for the first time in a while so full disclaimer
keys are buttons that are built into your tablet which you can program with shortcuts to speed up your process and I use these a lot on my Cintiq
obviously it's more weighty when you put the battery in but it does undeniably feel like it belongs to a lower price bracket tab
I noted it has a comfortable rubber grip along with the buttons so it didn't feel uncomfortable to use at all
I could use it for a long period of time without any problems or any strain on my hand so that was really good
I didn't detect any lag and also when I turned the computer off or just to turn the pen off and then went back to using it again
there wasn't any delay in getting it started again for anyone who may be curious as he's gonna mention the character this is one of my
she has a bit of a weakness for money and she doesn't like boats which is unfortunate because the one show is taking place on a boat so
I had a much more positive experience than I did with the previous one which I can only assume was damaged in transit
this would definitely be a low upfront expense option so if you have limited space and you're looking for a low-cost option
I'm taking a look at the Archos one-on-one internet tablet yet another Android tablet from Arcos the French BMP manufacturer previously
disparage the screen and really here because on the whole I still have been really impressed with it and it really doesn't take away from the experience
just don't expect other people to your left and right really to be enjoying the device the way you will be
I've seen even better than the 70 even though again it's supposed to be identical hardware so I am impressed with that
so far with everything about the device and I do find the 10-inch to be a completely different experience than the 70 since clearly
I hope to be able to get my hands on one of those when the time comes beyond some general web browsing
I haven't had any time to play with this so you're looking at the stock overlay that Arcos employs as you can see your music panel your video panel
I could just throw in some video so you guys can see what that performance is like and so enough of that as you can see it
on-screen controls a little bit of lag there but that resolves itself pretty much lets you take us home and I mean so far
so if you see any lag that might be to blame but everything all in all looks really good here so far out of the box last thing
I'm not even going to demonstrate here but if I just were to open up a book just see you guys see loading time you know
I have this set to the night mode again if you notice the also the keyboard that's been coming up on-screen is not the Swift key again
key difference on this tablet is that it is slightly larger and as a result on the left side of the device as you can see
I'm really liking since it does articulate so that you can have it in both an angle for viewing movies as well as browsing the web hands-free
I really liked it so far and commend our coast on doing a very good job of putting out an affordable tablet
I can't really think can be said for anything then the Galaxy Tab right now so at this price point highly
it'll make you empower her in hansung and engaging and it has been enhanced and engaging for me as well as natural basically it lets you you know
so you'll be able to erase you know slick if you made a mess up or anything so it's very nice
so this is the settings for the doc which is basically your centralized place for all the tablet information and this is the settings portion of it
if you want to touch input you would check that box you can set up everything there as well as enabled
so you can really like play around and really get used to it now and just playing around and making her face all weird we
there's kind of games and incendiary stuff in there and I'm using this on a Mac and it's also available on Windows as well so Windows users
it comes with a very extensive tutorial so if anybody who is new and really wants to get to learn how to use it they can
this video will tell us that we've done a good job so go ahead and click that like and subscribe button and until next week

HD 10 kids Edition as known as king of all those kids tablets because of having top position in search trends and day by day increasing demand
that's why we thought to provide complete review of Fire HD 10 kit Edition tablet to make your buying decision right
the picture quality won't be compromised even from a side view multi-touch screen you can use a pinching motion to zoom in and out of pictures
so there's a thank you card very cute though the links you need to make the tablet work like the drivers and obviously the tablet
but that's obvious because the working one was a medium and this is a small one it comes with a globe
so you can normally leave on your hands and don't click anything but in this one you don't need that and the pen it fits perfectly in my hand
I don't know how to say in the cable it's pretty long and I like it this way because I like to be far away from my desk up
if you was planning to buy a target to draw or whatever you want you can even play also on it that works well too
I wanted to draw something easy but I didn't have an idea for it so this is to check who check is good but yeah
I really like doing line out with it but that's an irony because I didn't do a line out to you okay
I'm in heaven really I really loved and yeah it has better specifications that's how it's quite then the walking on a hat
I don't know I will show you that the specifications on this screen you can all also just search it on the official page
I'm trying yeah and I have one more question I wanted to ask you guys different some story times or something
I mean I know my English is pretty bad backward and I if I were to write it down they would feel easier and it would be better
meaning that can be viewed from an angle without looking washed out which is a common issue on other budget tablets
that provides good performance for general tasks like web browsing but I did notice occasional hesitation when switching between apps the tablet performs very well for gaming for example
the tablet also has a full sized USB port allowing you to connect a flash drive and play media directly from it
the tablet also has bluetooth connectivity for pairing with a Bluetooth keyboard or Bluetooth speakers which is good because the speakers built into the unit
the tablet also has some weight to it which is important to keep in mind if you plan to hold it for an extended period of time overall
the octa-core processor keeps things moving along moogly and bloatware is non-existent on this tablet with only a handful of apps installed out the box
if you liked the video please subscribe share and hit the bell button so you can get the notification for the new video
you get a pen which is called p-51 and and you get a tablet holder which has nibs on the bottom gonna show you know
now if you some people if you don't like the cable and you'd like a wireless tablet you can pick this up for an extra forty euros on
there's this section on the right here it has kind of a glossy plastic look to it here and the buttons as well
there's four rubber grips to stop it from slipping and also the OG logo in the middle right there and just some other information one thing
the p51 pen has a really nice rubbery feel to it so it doesn't slip out of your hand and it's not too heavy compared to other pens now
I got comes with a charger which you insert directly into the bottom if I can just get that right here so like so
whose range is gonna put it in with my hand just like that press on it and boom it's Luntz back in
it's possibly to draw on the tablet when it has no screens because the more expensive tablets have a screen which you can draw on
but the thing is when you're drawing you can actually see a cursor if you just hover lightly over so you're not pressing
if you're going to repress pressure sensitivity right here you can change the click sensitivity consider from light to heavy now if you don't have a screen protector
then if we go into the barrel button to there's different mouse commands right here so you can just change that
maybe you only wanted to work on half the half of the monitor but I'm obviously gonna or you can do all of them
I'm pretty much drawing and it's nearly happened in real time on my computer so I'm just gonna use the undo button just like that
I'm gonna draw really lightly right now it's the lightest and I'm gonna put a bit of pressure on a bit more
it's a really really nice drawing tablet and I would really recommend it if you're on a budget so guys thank you so much for watching
so anyway the microphone the tablet company huion who yawn we on sent me this and I'm very thankful and grateful
it is a little difficult to figure out what games to put on there and depending on the age group and the child
you also have time so you can obviously limit the days of the week and how much time and anything else
I'd say this is a really great tablet especially when I got it for so cheap and overall I like this tablet
so yeah this is uh much concludes that review and remember if you like this review as always with a big old thumbs up
so that's kind of cool but it doesn't do you much good without the screen protector off or the rubber off
I found this using the stylus is very responsive if you tap right here that's your bottom right bottom left top left and top right of your computer screen
the pen can be used in hovering mode use being used from 5 to 7 millimeters above the tablet itself like
meaning that the lighter you press the thinner your line is or the harder you press the more thicker your line is
For you digital artists who are on a budget, you'll be excited to know that the Cintiq 16 is an affordable option to the more expensive Cintiq Pros.
It delivers the top-notch drawing experience that you'd expect from a Cintiq, without all the bells and whistles that put the Cintiq Pro at a higher price point.
It comes with Wacom's most advanced pen, the Pro Pen 2, which has a whopping 8,192 Pressure Levels on the pen tip and the eraser.
The image you'll get on this device is not as sharp as what you'd get on the newer 4K models, but it's more than adequate for art and design.
As I began to zoom out, I did find it difficult to see the exact shape of some of the smaller marks
The Cintiq 16 can be connected to your computer using HDMI to drive the video signal, and USB to drive the tablet input.
No other display option is provided, but you could buy a third party adapter to convert HDMI to another display type.
The power cable connects to a larger power brick, and the total length of the combined cables was adequate for my large desk.
Nevertheless, you have the option of creating on-screen buttons you can tap on with the pen, to invoke shortcuts and commands.
There is however a pen holder that pulls out to reveal three replacement nibs for the pen and a nib remover.
So that's an overview of what the Cintiq 16 can do, but let's talk about how it compares to some of the other options out there.
To me, it's obvious that the Cintiq 16 is meant to compete with the wide range of imitation Cintiqs on the market.
Sure, there are other pens out there that support 8,192 pressure levels, but that's not all that's important in a quality pen.
Wacom pens are well-built, and the Pro Pen 2 isn't going to fall apart, even under heavy use for years on end.
because that's something you're going to be holding the entire time you are drawing, and you want it to be comfortable.
You want to be able to pick up your pen and start drawing, without having to wait because you forgot to charge it.
The stand works essentially the same as the generic ones used for many of the Cintiq alternatives, but it feels a lot more solid.
The Cintiq 16 tablet and driver were easy to install, and performance has been consistent across all of the art applications
The Cintiq 16 supports a range of pens and nibs which can extend the functions of the tablet and give a different feel while drawing.
And the Cintiq 16 does not feature any external USB ports for connecting peripherals. There are, of course, differences in price as well.
If you're torn between the Cintiq 16 and the Pro models, you'll have to compare the features and decide which ones you really need.
The screen surface on the Cintiq 16 can feel sticky on your skin until you break it in, but it's not as sticky as a glossy screen.
If that sounds like something that would bother you, you can wear a glove while you're drawing, but it wasn't bothersome enough to keep me from drawing.
And now for my conclusion, but first, if you're new on this channel, make sure to subscribe and click the bell icon to enable notifications.
but, for those of you who would rather choose quality over price, in my opinion it's worth the extra $100 to $200 to get something that's better quality overall.
You can find links to purchase the Cintiq 16 and other types of display tablets in the description of this video or at kit.com/AaronRutten.
T is very similar to what you see on the Lenovo Hilux you can actually dismount the tablet itself and mounted backwards onto the keyboard
like so so that you can use the device as perhaps a video screen or a presentation screen just looking up close here
we can charge directly through the keyboard so charging both the battery in the keyboard itself and the battery on the tablet but on the other side
I go around doing training and work in the board rooms all across Australia most boardrooms still have a VGA connection
I don't need to carry a dongle and I guess that's a bonus for a lot of people because it's built right into the hardware now
it's probably somewhere between 6 and 8 hours of runtime on the device itself from the average business user and at least that again with the keyboard attached
I would imagine that the kind of pen that's going to come in that device is probably something like the Samsung Galaxy S Pen
and the reason is that it has a lot more of the features that are going to tick the boxes for those corporate users for example having that
that 1080p screen is also going to solve a lot of the headaches that come with screen scaling in Windows for corporate users
because now i don't have to deal with the glare of my ceiling lights bouncing off my tablet and into my eyes
the pens are all the same line that they've used before lightweight comfortable and simple and the case they come with is the same cylinder
the accuracy is also excellent with minimal parallax around the corners and i have zero complaints about the pen pressure as a standard
drivers for the pressure curves but they've always felt natural to me and easy to adapt to after switching from other tablets
which is a bit annoying but i have just enough space to make it work if you're a laptop user this won't be an issue for you at all
which is good because unplugging it is not as easy as the cables are all in the back instead of the side you can still register pen inputs
it's big so you need to make sure you have the space for it or that you're in need of a second monitor second
patrons can get access to the full res version and a 1080p wallpaper version will be up on my new grounds also
let's move on this is a tad bit different than anything else i've ever done on this channel but i couldn't pass this up a few weeks ago
because you can't draw without a pen and now time to draw but just kidding not yet we actually have to set up the driver
it's got this really neat pressure sensitivity bar and an area to test it in so that's pretty neat now we draw
it's so nice you can customize them however you'd like i already liked what they had in place so i didn't mess with it at all
and honestly it's super nice to work with it worked very well for paint tool sai which is what i used in the speed paint
uh not really sure how it reacts in other programs as this is the only one that i used but overall my experience was overwhelmingly positive
if you have any questions or any problems with the tablet feel free to call the support team over at gammon
they're very nice and super responsive and they were very helpful in helping me set this up at the end of the day
thank you to the folks at gaomon that reached out to me and let me have this great opportunity as always the links are in the description
why is this tablet becoming popular among artists graphics designers and professionals alike even if you are a new user maybe tutoring or taking classes and giving presentations
again you can customize it fully as you prefer some buttons have lines emboss would like outwards which is really helpful
the pen feels quite natural to hold if your hands are medium to large or it takes getting used to little bit so it has two buttons
this has a 10 by 6-inch work area tablet it's pretty standard with 8000 192 levels pressure sensitivity the report rate is 250 R PSN 5080 LPI resolution
I recommend you first set everything as required at one time and then start actually using it so many applications like even as you can see on
I wish the pen came with the dock or a stand or at least there was a cap for this one
section of this video can find the link for the latest updated pricing and the big eke highly recommends this tablet
and this is the Nook Tablet think of it as the nut collar - in fact from the outside you almost wouldn't know that this was a different model
BNN content and they say also they're gonna be partnering with some third-party multimedia them by video delivery services and that space is reserved for that
Google has pretty straight rules about what you can do with honey come at this point and completely changing the UI which both Amazon and BNN have done
and that's not a bad thing because being on really got it right here and and I find that actually a little bit more friendly than the Kindle Fire
there's always a keep reading link here to whatever book you've been reading less and is also book icon down there
I would say that these are better done in portrait because it really is the layout is more suited to them
you can tap in zoom and there's also an article mode as well so you can just read the text because let's face it
this is good for eleven and a half hours of reading or nine hours of video playback and since Barnes & Noble has many bricks and mortar stories
you can turn page animations on and off and you can either swipe or a tap to change a page page
ePub reader works with Adobe DRM books both nuke format books which use a credit card based DRM scheme and the standard Adobe DRM
so it's all compatible with this and we also have access to brightness here right in the screen which is nice if you're reading in
it's a little too bright or too dark and we have discovery which of course is shopping oriented now even though
I have ISBN information and such on my book and it's showing me things in store that are similar to what I'm reading right now
go back to the book just by tapping the book icon and say well you need to Wikipedia after all nicely done
BNN also has their own apps but not as many apps as uh amazon has in their app store but some of the basics are here
there are none available here so if you wrote and do things like that or just sideload the Android Market because this does not have the full Android Market
then you can add those things but otherwise it's a no-go if you're notable bit of a hacker so we've got games here we've got
Angry Birds all that kind of thing and this is certainly capable of handling that given the fast dual core CPU
we've just covered the color red and some books are even more interactive in terms of what you cap on and what you do
if you're wondering one is there's a microphone other than for trying to sign sideload or download some VoIP based applications
we've got a 1080p high profile video here that we're going to try out kind of pointless a high-resolution cuz this does not have HDMI out or DLNA
it's playing just fine and boy that speakers pretty loud first 7-inch tablet to him so there's locally stored mpeg-4 content
so if you want to listen to music while you're reading you can do it unless we will take a look at the web browser this is your usual
Android WebKit based web browser operates in portrait and landscape mode and will get to see the on-screen keyboard here which is large and lovely
this is more robust easy to use and you can turn a little clicking sound effects on and off of the keyboard as well so
it's a portable size and weight fifteen point six inches screen fifteen millimeters thickness and weighs only 1.5 kilograms fade feature number two 8,192 levels of pen pressure sensitivity
zis is I gaming goopster and I'm doing a product review on two things but it's basically for one thing and so two products
we have a tablet every tablet case and this is a windows tablet and so that me and everyone going windows
Monday I'm probably going to do a possible quiz or would you rather and have these boot for bean boozled which we all know
I just put it back in a casing cuz I like to keep pieces and we have our actual tablet right tablet a n
um it doesn't come stock with this but it can expand up to its 64 gigs and we have our auxiliary or headphones port 3.5
which is the actual code for the fur you on your office and it comes with a charger of a ready boat with it
okay okay so when you depart it up it's going to take a little while but basically you turn on and turn on it
just swipe up usually you'd put a password in or you'd set it up but I've set it up already to my account even noobster
actually but they're not that great anyways but the main camera that's just for the selfie camera main camera is ok
um as many things like settings this has the windows 10 version settings see that and it connects from the internet
probably for about six hours a good six hours and that's that like 100 knots out of like 100 on display for a percent display setting brightness
cost me about a 150 dollars with applicable tax and you can find any retailer like Best Buy or microcenter or staples office people even so yeah
they're fairly inexpensive if I was to give a two-year-old an iPad that be a little ridiculous that's that's 600 bucks
most of them are learning that sing-along apps things that she actually enjoys things that don't upset her when she can't can't get it to go
it does have two speakers which give you awesome sound for them watching sing-along videos or anything like that so down below
I'll leave a link of the screen protector that I used fairly inexpensive and then the Fire HD eight kids Edition
you want to make sure that you get the new version and not the old one you also want to make sure you get the larger memory so
I was really excited about this tablets because it's much larger than any of my previous ones at nineteen point five inches it's an IPS
that's gonna be amazing and so helpful when you're working on line work and that kind of thing if you're interested in having a look at this tablets
I've left some links in the description box below and at the time of recording this it's currently retailing at about 499 dollars in terms of the unboxing
this is another great touch and it's nice to have a backup and then last but not least the huion canvas
with how sturdy and strong the stand is it's very heavy duty and it feels like it's really really built to last
the tablet is a great size as I mentioned before I've never used a larger tablets like this and I'm really excited about the possibilities
the pen moved smoothly on the screen even with the screen protector and the lines registered cleanly - which is amazing
one downside is that it doesn't have an eraser on the end but it does have two buttons so you can change the preset on them
I chose to have one button for the undo process and the other one for the eraser as I spoke about before I really do
also with the stand the whole setup becomes quite heavy so I can imagine you can tree travel around with this one and I don't think that's intended
this is very much a tablets that you set on the desk as part of your workspace in terms of the cons
I had a little issue with the calibration at first but after following some advice online and uninstalling the drivers then reinstalling the drivers from huion website
especially if you've been working with traditional media before and you've been interested in trying a display like this where you can actually paint on the screen
if you'd like to see more drawing and painting videos then make sure you subscribed and any likes or shares on this video
I really hope you've enjoyed watching this video and I hope having an awesome day and I'll see you all soon
okay this is going to be my review of this monoprice graphics tablet it's ten inches by six and a quarter inches working area
so it's an extremely good deal for this size of a tablet but let's see later on if it actually is worth the money
this little lift up sheet so you can slide a paper underneath it and trace if you draw by hand with a pencil there we go like
and here's the pin it so button there the button is that no eraser button but I never really used one to begin with on the other tablet
especially this grip here because this doesn't seem to fit very well but it works so can't really complain and actually it is a three button
well it lets you basically right on the screen and then you can go back to mouse mode and all your little doodles go away
it could be a little awkward to sometimes because the program can actually be running and down there in the corner but it won't be selected
I don't that's just Windows 7 for you so if you click off if you have it down here and then you click off of it
I haven't checked to see if there's an update but considering on the back of the box that says please note some programs will not work on Windows 7
I'm drawn really really lightly and then I can really press down on and draw some fat bold lines oops moved it around there we go and like
I'm really cramming it into the tablet and right now I'm really just barely touching the tablet and let's go ahead and exit out of that
Media Player or whatever it basically just replaces the mouse so in if you know if you want to use it the pin instead of a mouse
it doesn't matter but so you can even use those like closed copy paste and whatnot to make working on your computer even easier or even quicker personally
I still like the mouse I bought this mainly to just doodle with but so but is it worth the value
I mean yes it is I have used I had in the past a Wacom pen partner and I would still be using it
it was a serial connector it would use and you had to have both the ps2 port and a serial port on your computer which is way outdated
Wacom pen I think is about 60 or 70 dollars and it is considerably smaller the Wacom pen if I'm not mistaken is about the size of this book
it's very sensitive that the pressure levels seem to work just great and it also has some nice customization features if you go into the thing here
you could set a data area so your pencil or your pin wouldn't try to go off of it so yeah pretty cool features and an amazing price
it's an amazing price for a very good quality product like I said except for the pin which seems a little cheap
there's also cameras on this five megapixel front-facing camera and if we take a quick look around the back you will see
feels very very nice in the hand across this top edge here we have got the volume up and down also the power switch across the top edge
now if we take a closer look at the screen you'll see that the resolution is plenty good enough for this size screen and thanks to the ips
if you're looking for a nice budget friendly but really high quality android tablet then the king pad sa-10 is well worth checking out
you're drawing on an external display in other words and needs a host computer and a display for you to be able to use it properly now
now join me and remember who you were supposed to be by hitting that subscribe button clicking that bell so you won't miss anything
we begin with the quick unboxing just to show you the contents and what it comes with to start off which is uncommon
so they're pretty generous with the amount of spare nibs they give you a smudge guard glove and finally the pen itself
I've tested it's got two programmable buttons and the pen tip does have some give to it but it's not a mushy kind of give
altogether one is manual adjustment like we just mentioned and the other it just kind of cycles through the different colors now
keys is where you're going to program all your shortcut keys right here is a scroll dial we're starting on there
and make sure we have this windows inked in a gold.when tab is sort of getting deprecated now in these programs monitor
basically how it works is you're gonna configure your settings save as whatever the application name is and then you're gonna have to open up
you know on the tablet itself as I move the pen back and forth the quicker speeds fortunately even with cross-hatching
I'm not noticing any kind of cursor drift either when I'm moving the pen back before the next tests are for consistent pressure curves meaning
obviously how the tablet performs you know in a live drawing and the good news is the m0 6-10 tablet performs admirably
I experimented with a bunch of different brushes and textures and such and clip studio paint and overall had a great experience using the tablet
I experienced when trying to cycle through two different lighting options now two artists all his credit when I spoke to them about the issues I was experiencing
they did send me a beta driver to test which did away with any of the crashing and the startup issues
all if you've watched my videos before that type of customer services support is really important to me and helps when
I like to see a little bit more stability in that driver now like I said a lot of stuff going on right now they did
if you wouldn't be so kind to drop a like down below you folks be safe out there and I will check you out in the next one
let's go ahead and take a look taking a look around the Sony Xperia z2 the first couple things you're going to notice here is how thin it is
you have the verizon logo the XV real logo on the bottom and the camera up there in the top right-hand corner and on the front of the tablet
inch tablet here very fast and overall it's very thin and light weight as well coming in actually about two ounces lighter than the tablet
the front facing camera is 2.2 megapixels and this has been said by everybody in the world that knows their technology and their tablets
now shoot some okay pictures and 1080p video so overall it does an okay job but just don't take pictures with your tablets people overall
if you like this video give it a thumbs up and hit that subscribe button and we'll catch you guys in the next video
today we're gonna be taking a look at another android tablet and this one's known as the take class or T class m16
I mean it's really not that bad but for 2020 and the price you're paying they should be a bit thinner
I really like about this tablet is HDMI out given its a micro HDMI port but it does look great on a big-screen TV
it's got a built in 7500 milliamp hour battery but unfortunately it does not support quick charge charging this thing up takes absolutely forever
you'll see that in a bit so as for video playback web browsing and even email checking this tablet works out just fine
there is one thing bugging me about this screen though it's not just the glare but when I go into I 264 and I check out display
I completely understand that all three tablets I just mentioned blow this thing out of the water but even on lower end tablets like the fire 10
Tekken dark resurrection not super hard game to run 1x resolutions using an Xbox one Bluetooth controller but we're not at full speed
I can do to make this run better Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is an easier game to run with the redream emulator
today is edge from double-edged gaming and today we're reviewing the ultra tab my jazz 7-inch one not the 10-inch it comes with stop
you can get a microfiber cloth that you get with your glasses you could wipe that sucker down and get rid of all the scratches that's on it
a little ramp comes with 512 but only let's use 250 don't know why slowed up the Barbie world's my sister load up this Minecraft world real quick
of course you're not singing as good as this and it comes with a little stylus pen you get with it
because maybe you don't want to reach all the way up there just to put the volume up this little button here
I don't know haven't ran the Flash Player setup but and the internet browsing it's good I'll show you here browsing from the internet
really good well worth the hundred fifty dollars go pick yourself up one and enjoy till next time guys has been edge from SS gaming see
I got it on Amazon with Amazon Prime so I got it right away and that was $59.99 plus $10 so $69.99
I set it up like the Dell or like the Asus or what and I said well set it up like the Dell and boom
and there is only one gig of ram so don't I wouldn't expect a lot of multitasking as often the case with very low cost Windows tablets
so memory is not an issue it comes with Pogoplug a 10 gigabytes free of Pogoplug so you get off you know you get the desktop storage
I was gonna place a Skype call but instead you know what I'll do is I'll run a little youtube video so you can hear what the sound is
just fine now there are a few negatives it does have a camera not the greatest camera you ever saw and and and front and back
I don't think you'd really ever want to use the camera for anything that's what I was gonna do a Skype call
oh yeah you can even use snap so you can you know you can you can multitask and I'll be honest
it's not gonna let you do the same kind of product if work that you can do this so this may be a clearance
frankly the wind book 7-inch TWU 700 tablet Windows 8.1 with Bing has a one-year limited warranty a year of office
so if you've got a use for it a BA I mean I don't know what I'm gonna do with it so it's the win
it's a win even for just for having the chat room running in the background or watching videos in the backseat for a kid
I plugged in my gaming headsets and turned up the volume all the way there were a little better but still distributing only about 15 decibels of pure treble
I might get over an hour tops out of this battery on the bright side there is an SD card slot which allows this
Bridge to be used as a standalone device with no need for Wi-Fi as long as your media is saved on that SD card
it does also have a front and rear cam but each only have a 2 megapixel quality software wise the operating system architecture runs the Android 4.1 jellybean
Android users are used to see device to this hall are usually only equipped with one gigabyte of RAM which this one is so that cost and google apps
running in the background will bring this device to the crawl if you try to get fancy with all the multiple apps so a turn
I do not leave in the car because it just tends to run too hot is this $45 tablet worth it
my overall suggestion would be to cut back on those monster drinks for a week and spend the extra $30 on the Amazon fire
so i'm going to plug it in today and test drive stick but for now i'm just gonna put it back here
wow it's well thought out here like because some of you guys might be like traveling you know laptop and stuff just carrying this tablet in the back
you don't know um going to my studio like usually around six o'clock just to start my day all right so oh nice sim slap and oh wow
wow because usually when i have new tablet and things um they came with like pin that you have to put the battery on them
uh we might be able to get some guys in my studio to do some 3d works also on this tablet and see how
i thought it was some kind of like a walk on topic and i think the the feel of the pen and the weight the responsiveness
that may be part of the pressure setting in the um software you can use it as an alternative to walk on tablet
this one is the only one i've seen so far other than what's on tablet that you don't have to put the battery in the pen
what the price point of this tablet is so and i have a couple of artists in my studio um test it out and they said they're pretty good
it's going to be sped up so but you will get the feel of of what it's capable of in the beginning
they're not as good as apple pencil or something like that but this one is actually promising and i uh i urge you to try
because i have to deal with a lot of clients and a lot of projects so anyways my new studio is called namsan digital studios
you can look at it on my youtube link or my social media thing and thanks again for um having me
now this is primarily a cell phone smartphone os that they grab from the high sense line of phones the a5 the a5c the a6 etc
so you will get all the high smart stuff here on the side and you'll get your panels and pretty much
it will tell you after a certain amount of time so these things are in place for people that do have issues with their eyes
and if i turn it this side yes i'm pointing it at one of the sides of the studio lights but you can see that it does change
it's really hard to explain on camera because this thing is something you're going to want to see with your naked eyes again
that comes with the territory of having e-ink which is basically a very obvious thing you will see that this is very fluid
pdfs have always been very important to screens that are very large and this is a fairly large screen in fact
the camera and the reflection is there a little bit but it is matte screen so it's a very comfortable experience
you side load on to here but this is just giving you an idea of how much screen real estate you have
it's as easy on the eyes as e-ink is but you don't have any of that lag because of the refresh rate
coverage on this device camera test outdoor test and a bunch more comparisons so for a full review of the high sense
i find it good to try and thumbnail each chapter but it can be pretty draining to do so typically per session
even for some of my comic i've had a bit of inconsistent style due to taking a couple of months to get to where i am
i'd also suggest doing some test pages to see how you want to shade and color each page to keep it consistent
i've been using both of these methods to make speech bubbles versus the older pages and they look a lot better to the point
and what works best for your own pages as well as test on the site and make sure they look fine
luckily webtoons lets you preview the pages for both mobile and desktop so be sure to check both before uploading the pages
a lot of comic making just comes up to preference and what you enjoy so keep that in mind while going down this beautiful and sometimes painful path
is that when you plug it in and it has cute little lights like this look at that it looks cute i like it
it is fantastic for any new artists or just artists that want a new tablet for on the go or maybe even an upgrade because again it's good it
it is a wonderful tablet and i highly recommend it all links will be in the description for if you want to look into this tablet or get it
i really am so grateful for this company for sending me this and to try it out and i am grateful for you guys for listening to me
so you got to kind of cross your fingers and hope it's what you paid for absolutely nothing else on that box
there's a power button and there's also a refresh button just pretty much confuses you with which one is the power button and of course the expandable
along the top that shows the available memory out of the two gigabytes of memory and come quickly clear that out
and you get all the access to all the google apps and games and all that great stuff some tablets actually
the biggest downside of the tablet isn't the performance but the actual screen itself compared to the other tablets mentioned which have excellent screens
you've pretty much got to have it mounted with a stand and use it straight on the second you pick it up or move it around
there's 8,000 24 by a 600 resolution screen the Mallee 400 GPU which you just saw in action on the game
so it's really great to see two gigs in a very low budget tablet like this now for some not so good news
mAh which is great for a tablet the same as my HP TouchPad problem is when I actually open it up and checked with his application
the first thing we're gonna need to do is swipe from the top of the tablet and go to these settings menu in these settings menu
now we need to put a little checkmark here to allow us to install the routing application and any other application from an apk file
open it up and we're gonna go to kingroot dotnet and here is a routing app called king route and you can do it directly from the device
there's a few other applications that come along with it but mostly the routing feature is what we want so go to the page
now we're going to install the app just takes a moment and we need to open it up and authorize the routing
when we do this the orientation is gonna switch a little so prepare yourself forces it to be in portrait mode
so now we're gonna click try to root and just wait for the counter to get to a hundred percent now
we're just going to click a verify of root and it's gonna check our device now anytime app needs to be permissions
so you can take these stickers and you can sticker up the back of your tablet or on the side or as
so so here's just a look at some of the apps and YouTube Karaca read some of the videos and YouTube kids
so you know it's just taking pictures for fun and that kind of thing if they'd like to use that so
so if you need to adjust for height but the headphones themselves the pads they fit very snug with the Disney air book
I always know what he's doing with the tablet because I can just look on the family link and it will tell me with the apps
I like how he can't get access to full YouTube on this tablet and I also like the case because I have broken many a tablet or correction
my son has so just by dropping the force of dropping it it will catch an edge and all of a sudden
this tablet is the how it turns on so I'm pressing if the screen is off and I'm pressing where the home button should be
it means that even if they drop it even if you're on cement it's still going to just bounce and keep on going
it's also really nice to have a dedicated tablet just for your kids when you want your tablet and your child's using it
the cursor just wouldn't show up and the only way to fix it is to restart my computer which is very very annoying
I wouldn't buy this tablet even though it's around $20 it's not worth $20 this tablet has brought me a lot more annoyance than anything else and hey
and if you're looking for something really really temporary or something that you'll rarely use and you need it to be on the go then
sorry if this is different from my normal content but I was really bugged by it and wanted to make sure no one else got it
Fujitsu understated design style as you can see it's running a full version of Windows 8 Professional including the the desktop
so this is a tablet that we can run on all of our native desktop applications on as well as the Windows Store apps
so it's pretty amazing to have a nice small form-factor tablet like this weighing as much as the typical consumer tablets
it'll be easy just to get a new upgrade battery and replace it which is a fantastic feature of this tablet now
the screens are actually glued in place so that a technician can practically do any repairs to a tablet like this in the field whereas with the fridge
Wacom tablet out called the Intuos the newer Intuos model has a few more features to it but some people still stand by the bamboos as the best
that can be programmed which I'll cover in the software section the tactility on the Express keys is very nice and gives you an audible
the tablet will recognize the pen at a one-centimeter hover and can drag right-click scroll and just left-click there are 1,024 pressure channels
they don't come with everything so you won't have the drivers on the CD so you have to visit the Wacom website and download the bamboo drivers once
you can turn on the touch system and that will allow you to change your touch functions on to the build the polygon buttons are called
the rubber pads in the wireless cover for my tablet are missing however yours might have them the pin holder on the side is stretchy so you can fit
if you use this thing on a regular basis to order more pentas you can go to the outcomes website and you can order them from there and also
so let's talk about some of the specs of this tablet first off it's very light weighing in at just about one and a half pounds
it's just around 8 inches by 5 inches and this is a touch pad and it features a patented electromagnetic resonance method technology
I'm told is supposed to have like a paper like feel that I guess you can say that's sort of true
Pentagon has two programmable buttons on the bottom half of it and there's also an eraser on top to you know a ratio art now one thing
I said I'm not that good at drawing so it's hard for me to show you um you know it's really good draws with this
it's kind of recommended like right in the middle between experts and beginners retails for around one hundred and fifty dollars
and it's a great way to get started if you just get into design or you want to like touch up your pictures for photography yeah
Start button there so from your file explorer settings power and all that fun stuff that of course is your Windows button to cycle through different application
all those applications are pinned you can also show notifications and you can have it looking similar to what was in your desktop
Windows Media Player I can multitask by basically dragging from the top and that was split it into two screens even if I open up more
we can be a little jarring when you switch into tablet mode because it doesn't you know it doesn't necessarily flow the same way but it works
that's why that's there and but you can't do multiple desktops here in this mode so again just showing you what
now how does it look and feel when you're using something that's a seven inches unlike the HP stream 7 this is what your it looks like
it does feel well quite well built and it's full metal aluminium body at the back here with a plastic top
nothing doesn't feel like it's very cheap like I used to have a sheep-shearing arrogant tablet and it was very plastic II in the build quality
and you can make it stand as well to pin wall plug for a USB charger or they even included some headphones
you notice these bubbles but then again this is a cheap tablet so you know it's not unusual to have something like this
this is a cheap plastic screen protector and you can always remove this and install a glass protector a better one if you wish okay so now
yeah one of the strengths of this tablet is set screen which is not fantastic and another thing is the the speakers on this
so if you're it's not a problem if you're listening to music but it is a problem if you're listening to someone talking
so now we were done with the benchmark testing and it scored fourteen thousand five hundred to the tree on the antutu benchmark tests
I guess that's pretty normal for an entry level tablet like this and being a two gigabyte tablet with the processor that it has it is a bit lagging
it does tend to lack a bit especially when I play full screen YouTube videos and I'm downloading something in the background and installing
I'm going to show you some sample video clips taken with the legally patent and some sample images as you can see here
I tried before but not bad for a wandering it doesn't now the LeapPad turn has an ef-1 jack at the site
oops so once you've opened the cover you can see that there are two slots here these are for the SIM cards
I do want to let you know in the interest of full disclosure that I paid for these with my own funds
and then you've got the HD 8 plus here selling for about $20 more so let's dive into the hardware now
to see you'll be able to use about twenty four point eight gigs of that 32 but they both have the option to add an SD card
now the other big differentiator of the HD 8 plus is that it supports wireless charging so if you have a Qi charger it's spelled
it's got a 9 watt charger versus a 5 watt that comes with the HD 8 but they both support faster charging
but neither come with a 15 watt charger and speaking of the battery amazon says you'll get 12 hours of battery life on this device in my testing
but if you're playing games or running apps that are more demanding on the processor that of course will impact the battery life and the battery is the same
in the + as it is in the regular HD 8 weight on both of them is about 12 and a half ounces or 350 five grams
gripe with this is the placement of the webcam which they decided to put here in the middle which kind of encourages a landscape orientation
and that sort of thing just note though that you cannot get any display output from this and the port runs at USB 2 speeds
but if you have to take a picture of something you've got the cameras at least on here but you're not going to be winning any photo
it has a slightly larger screen a little bit nicer build quality but that more expensive tablet performs exactly the same as these do and in fact
Sonic CD and we'll let that load and I'll do the same here on the HD 8 plus will load up Sonic CD on both
and of course it'll take about the same amount of time to load the game and will maybe jump into the first level
we'll go into start game and we'll select where we last left off and I'll do the same here on the other one
RAM for the other game that we loaded but if we repeat this step here on the other device and switch from Sonic CD over to Minecraft
but it's going to bring us back pretty much right where we left off on minecraft when we switched out so as you can see here
and if you're often having to switch out of your game to go and do something you might want to opt for the three gigs in the
it's a decent enough web browsing device and it should do well with email and some other basic things you might do with it
but if you do have a lot of tabs open you might see a little faster performance as you're switching between pages a little bit earlier
but it was able to do a pretty demanding web conference call with that that was fine prime video and Netflix
Store you get the Amazon App Store and a lot of the same apps and games are in the Amazon App
but if you're not that technically savvy it may not be the easiest thing to do so if those Google Play apps are really super important to you
and you're not so sure about your technical prowess this may not be the tablet for you but for many other folks
I think they're willing to deal with a little bit of inconvenience to get a useable tablet at a decent price now both tablets support Amazon voice commands
but you can see how it works at least here using the unofficial wireless charger that allows you to get that functionality
I think for most folks who don't need the extra RAM and the wireless charging the entry-level here should do fine
I think this tablet is going to be pretty good for people who are starting to get the hang of force ow work
and things like that but they are very very pricey but they are very good as well a lot of professionals use weapons and the Wacom Cintiq 13 HD
because one of the prices of is around 600 to 750 pounds or about 650 to 750 pound depending on where you shop for the same size tablet
because you obviously don't need discs just as well because my market doesn't have a disc at capability it doesn't have a disc thingy on it warranty card here
this is what it looks like inside and it has these different clips that you can kind of prop it up like that
we got a pen and the doorknob pen holder which is really cute and I really like the look at this pen
it said the human one actually looks more modern which it probably is because it's walk home is really old to be fair to them
I'm gonna go on Amazon now and order myself lightning HDMI lead so I can plug it into my monitor and I'll have to see you again
Oh so I just accidentally click this button and it was the eraser pen so to increase this and see oh very nice
I've just realized I've been looking at the screen and not on the display because I'm so used to looking up my monitor right okay
I'm gonna try and look on the display one thing I will say is obviously the display is not as bright
I like the colors on my screen this way unless I haven't got the same right all this type of app I think of yes
Mac format so I'm gonna click that and I'm gonna click apply and then when I click this button over here
I use the moss so that and then this should bring up my eraser and it does amazing right okay so now
I like to work on a big screen my tablet that I use for the iPad is a 12 inch screen
Mac and unfair comparison really but the display is still nice and crisp and it could do with being a little bit brighter
I would say but there might be settings to adjust that I don't think the resort so I've got some stats up here
the screen itself is actually 13.3 inches and it says it's 50 80 LPI and 266 PPS which I have no idea what that means
it has a zoom function and it has the hotkeys there so you can set the hot keys to how you want to set them up on your Photoshop
Pro is that it is a three in one cable so you haven't got cables flying everywhere the next Pro is the pressure
the back of the tablet has some anti slip pads which are very handy for desks or it's not kind of sliding around
I've only used it this one time as an initial unboxing another thing that is a silly thing that I like
there's just obviously a few things that I would change probably in the future but for the price point can't really complain it's a pretty good deal
hey what's up guys tim here just a couple of features that i forgot to mention on the hp elite x2 g4
but i tend to have all the cables over here on the on the right side of the tablet and it tends to clutter
why my name is ben barnett and welcome to my channel where i introduce and show products that will probably help you out in the creative world
let's talk money now to find one of these second hand on the market is rare and also to find them in such good condition
brand new one of these will set you back at a cool 299 pounds or you can purchase a refurbished one at a cheaper price now
my only criticism with the marker is it does feel a bit cheap and plasticky for the price that i've paid for
i actually used this for five days straight without a single charge and it still had enough juice inside for it to work
the remarkable screen does not reflect against the light therefore it makes it so easy and comfortable on the eyes to read
and i'll tell you something i've used this for two months now the majority of it being for planning and meeting
it may not seem that much and i've only used 0.38 gigabytes so capacity for this is no issue true to their word
it does advise charging the battery of the device for four hours before first use so that it is fully charged to start with the Picasso
it is not so small that it becomes cramped like you feel contained by it but not so large that it becomes cumbersome if it was slightly bigger
big beautiful screen very powerful device but it does get kind of cumbersome sometimes it does not fit all of my backpacks and travel bags that I normally carry
there's only one particular bag that it fits comfortably in whereas this guy would fit in practically any drawing or art bag that you would generally have with you
alright let's go into this with the proper expectations this is under 200 or right at $200 there are certain shortcuts that they have to take
there's certain corners that have to be cut as it are as it is and one of those is with the screen resolution
use your iPhone all right so it does come with Autodesk SketchBook pre-loaded on it but I am more familiar with ArtRage so that's what I'm gonna go into
probably not you're going to out scale the processing power of this device by having a lot of layers at a high resolution and using complex tools
rise up the resolution and that sort of thing so that is a lot of the issues going on here the case
but it fits in well it does have cutouts for the major buttons like the power button and your plugins here
this video is brought to you by definitely multimedia you know certified distributor distributor whatever as camera mobile vague s60 40 640 s640 bake s640 new bahabal bomber
Shanta thank you so much for filling in for me while everybody said you were marvelous and I should not come back
it starts at 120 19 the version that we have here is one hundred and forty nine dollars and this is the lenovo ideatab
does not have a back facing camera on the plasticky back and it's very plasticky very cheap looking on the front
the last thing on my list i wanted to mention is this display and hopefully this processor will let me get back to home home please
you what is up guys review of the XP pengie 640 and yeah so this Microsoft for tablet and I'm never doing it I'm I hope
this is a little tight but it's not it's not gonna break anything so don't worry don't worry it's just snuck okay second
this is just a disclaimer for anything tablet out there if you're using it to like if you're trying to carry out someone and you don't have a case
make sure you have a case for protective something because we're keeping this box because it is pretty thin so just be aware okay
it's like 25 so why not just stitch up after five bucks to get a good one you know or just a gal
okay yeah if you want to then buy this if you don't then don't but I would definitely recommend it at the end of the day is your choice
so full disclosure this was sent to me is not paid for however and this is my honest opinion on it
along with thinner bezels on the side the sides and back are made out of metal has a really premium feeling design to it on the right side
if you get into more graphically intense games it might get a little bit choppy or you might have to lower the settings just a little bit
i wasn't expecting this much quality from a company that i had not heard of until they reached out to me
something that you can easily slip in and out of a purse a briefcase or a backpack and take with you on the go and you want good performance
it's really heavy so entirely northern big mars book is like three of those two of those in one in one
it's really heavy so i can see our other camera here camera right here and you don't know what this guy is
yeah so it should say go to wi-fi manager if you want to get to put in your wi-fi there but yeah the settings may not work so
yeah so yeah all right so we pressed refresh connect and we had to wait searching so as you can see
there's a wi-fi bar up here so when the thing is connected yes when is it connected it will be filled so yes
the the learn book is well the youtube on it is not really up to date so i'll press update and start things been updating
we won't try because we don't know what really we don't want to hit the spot button because that would be having to pay some off
the teacher reads you say you can follow her by reading too or whatever the case may be so basically a book
yes so as you can see google as we said before drive is a part of google so we don't have to to re-enter our email okay
only so i might try amazon because i'm alright not a time but let's just see so as you guys can see
so it's returning other apple shoes up to see so a lot of those features are blocked as it is built mainly for school strictly school purposes
so it's only so let's try to search up a word um all right so let's set up this so i'm guessing oh as i said
so i'm guessing google in general is blocked so what we know going on at this point in time because most of the school things is done on google
we type in a book called coca boi so effender chapter one content so the whole google application google app is you could say basically blocked
quick settings ac manager wi-fi manager so the app store is not like any other apps to where you can go and download apps
i'll give it a uh well there's different there's different like features of it like different positions to rate it through the
the ebook is there so they keep that for the weight of the screen because they realize the screen is bringing down the lifting of the keyboard
they keep here to bridge the screen from raising the keyboard and i'm probably damaging the the the compartments in the middle
that's a wrap for the thing so i don't know down so all right fully nice and nice and handsome like a a book
It also has a touch ring which you can control with your finger so you can easily change brush or canvas size and scrolling a page
A pen also has two programmable buttons and comes with eight extra nibs and when the nib of the pen is damaged
it's monday the 15th of march today and i've got a busy old day today so i thought i will take you with me throughout the whole day
now it's very bright in here so i've had to move my desk all the way up um to this wall to be out of sunlight
um i could get some blinds but i like how bright this room is so i don't want to kind of block it out anyway
so yeah it's been quiet in that aspect as well so um but i think i've had one or two this weekend so we can look at those
i want to tidy up um and then what else so at the end of this week so hopefully by the time
um uh we have our next patreon online market um the first one we did back in november and it was kind of
it really helped some people and i feel wonderful that i could put my name to it so i decided to do it again
yeah so it's gonna be a lovely day but i do want to start off because i have been sent a gift now
i think this might be one of the first ones i've been given by a company um to to sort of try out and talk to you guys about
i am definitely not the first person first illustrator to be sent these so basically the company is let me cover my dress studio
these were actually gifted um from a job so like when i left employment in 2017 this was my leaving gift from that studio
i can't remember which ones they told me i'm getting so let's just have a look inside studio shaping sound so these are neo studio neo
let me let me let me look at like instructions of things because you know me this could go disastrously wrong
but there's three different types so if you've got like a smaller ear um you you've got different sizes you can play with
which i know is an issue with other earphones because my brother has just bought some of the expensive kind that matches his phone
it goes back a song and if you tap it three times it's sound so let me go back a song
um and again i'll let you know later on in the day what i think of them after using them for a few hours
okay right let me drink my coffee um and look at my to-do list and then we'll come up with a plan for the day
it's not me coming on there as i know it all because i'm definitely not i don't have a clue it's more to just open up a discussion
i have just sent an email to my manufacturer and my phone has just autocorrected it to say thanks babe so that's just happened
zoom call for an hour and then once we're done with that i'm going to do some tidying up and i'm going to package some orders
you just wanna hold you just wanna be with you till we grow old myself please single day so it's a little bit later
um i don't think people realize these are the kind of jobs that get done when you do this kind of task and putting on a market
i hid it but it's still there so i've kind of got that to use but this might take me two hours
where's this day gone but it's all good it'll be so worth it this weekend when the website looks great and all of the things so it's fine
i've actually had a few things come last week that i opened not on camera but i have laid them out on the table
so thank you laura for that and then i got some lovely goodies from molly moo so i got some bookmarks a print a little card
you've sent me these danny thank you so so much and then this didn't really come with a note really it
but it says here that she's had to close her shop as it wasn't worth the effort getting all the info for the changes on exedu to brexit
um and if you obviously can't do them yourself she sends them to you with like a sticky back so you can add them to your own
hang on let me try so this one is like a white and gold like a white and gold seal so those are beautiful
well um and i kind of understand like what direction to chat in and the second one just i just sit back and enjoy it
i think i'm gonna end the vlog here because i wanted to just film one day and hopefully you can see what i've got done in this day
i figure out the charging the one thing that i'm struggling to get used to is the tapping um but i'll get used to it
well now i can show this video to those knowledge thirsty people because today imma summarize how i make animations without using any animation program
video is sponsored by gamlon and i used their tablet to make the animation storyboard and reference stay till the end of the video for exclusive codes
in for months at a time next up i make some scribbles inside a ton of rectangles also known as a storyboard
you know now for the animation i usually use 1280 by 720 pixels for my canvas as it is the standard youtube video size
i'm saving these different frames into separate images notice that i keep them all the same name but i ordered them with different numbers saving them as poop
this is not only to help me organize my frames but to also put them into a free program called animation size assistant 2.
this program is a great way to easily put your animation into a looped gif format and find any mistakes or inconsistencies
okay so i've had this tablet since july 2020 so i have plenty of experience with it as a first impression
like as big as my laptop screen but this makes it perfect since it makes it easier to navigate around the screen
has this really interesting hoop on the end which i assume could have key chains on it or maybe i could put it on a hook
that's on the side of the tablet since it's quicker to whip out it's this little fabric thingy where i slide my stylus in
i got years ago which was a little over 100 bucks and this tablet does the job as clearly seen with all these drawings
nibs a free drawing glove or 50 off an extra pen tap on add both to cart proceed to checkout deliver to your address
heck if you just subscribe for one dollar a month you'll get your name on the end card of the videos
i make the next animation is gonna be hecka cool so i highly suggest you sub to my patreon right now to get your name immortalized on that video
that is what we're going to find out today fun fact so this is more like a trilogy at the moment
it's a new year and all of these new tablets are popping up and they are cheap and most of the time
i must say it got quite some weight to it and the reason why because it has this metal plate i like it
the camera at the front is pretty damn horrible and the same goes for the one at the back so just want to give you also a quick example
it also give you a quick demonstration about the microphone and i can tell you this one is also very horrible
this is one of the two programs and you can see that cpu set will show a lot of different options like the android system number nine
it's okay but i already know that it's not okay because sometimes even cpu that will not notice the fake software
oh man the naughty boys so you can see that they basically installed or pre-installed and fake android 9 version alright
so let's take a close look at some information whether it took out of the android device or the settings of the android and 8s64
so if you're seeing a device like this for not a lot of money with high specs most of the time it's highly possible
it's not that we're going to play some pub g because a lot of games you can't play them due of the old firmware
this is a great game to test it and even for a very old tablet i must say out of the box
the response of the screen is not bad at all especially playing a game like this that you need to have a very nice no input lag
let me know in the comments what you think of this consider subscribing hit that little bell and i will see you in the next video you
and it's got a resolution of 1 280 by 800 that's an ips display and it's got the quad core mediatek processor running at 1.3 gigahertz
yeah we'll have a look at the tablet so i have already set this up and put some maps on there just in the interest of saving time
nice sound from the speakers you can see everything runs pretty smoothly on it perfect for watching films streaming if you ever movies you're watching muppets
look at the camera and also switch around my front facing there we go hello so the camera works absolutely fine
well i think that's about everything i can show you for that now so that was the mayberry m6 quad core
there'll be a link in the description and in the comment section where you can go straight to the amazon page to buy this product and thanks for watching
it's not loves there but something brand new and will go too far into the details but it's from obnoxious hero cone a webtoon created by
I'm currently animating the first chapter and this image is from that chapter so hopefully this gets fewer excited and just
it's so convenient not having to worry about charging your pen and it also has 8,192 levels of pen pressure which
no battery and good pressure which really made it special for me and the support from the company has been really quick and helpful cons
we all have them if there's a little lag here and there but I've seen that on all tablets so we can't all be perfect
guys this is what you've all been waiting for and I know this is what you've been waiting for because I read the comments that's right
I'm tossing your ass in the pit but if that's not enough let me just try to explain myself for just a minute here
Wacom tablet got the job done quite well for a cheap price but after about four to five years of using it
I found myself wanting to upgrade to something a little more high-tech and with an IDO little color display to top
I'm gonna go off the shits so let's start from the beginning like not even having plugged this sucker in yet
well you get the tablet some wires to hook it up the pen the pen holder with extra nubs a two finger artist
most professional artists and animators have their tablets on a slight incline to reduce a lot of that long-term muscle stress
you're probably gonna end up looking like that boomer caricature of Pikachu riding a guy's neck as he looks at his phone
after a while of working with this thing it starts to kind of make my neck feel like it's about to hit the nené and just snap but honestly
run that [ __ ] and bam you're good I'm running this on Windows and thankfully the drivers that I installed don't conflict with my Wacom tablets drivers
but then now hows about the tablet functionality wise the display is fairly responsive to the pen and it has pretty great pressure sensitivity for digital painting
I've tried out and charging the pen separately is so annoying but like I said the pen is just that a pen
I'd suggest thoroughly stretching out the glove of it before use as it's size is rather small on my big ape hands altogether
180 dollars is rather inexpensive compared to most of the top-notch equipment for this sort of thing on the market and if you can get over a shortcomings
I'd say it's a worthwhile purchase that being said though if you are a beginner artist in general not just the beginner tablet user a beginner artist
I'd rather recommend that you start with a much cheaper alternative without a display first and then get around to this
although if you're an experienced tablet user or a professional artist this cheaper alternative might not be the best choice for you
for me this just helps me find information rapidly and it's all organized folder by business other folders within that folder notebooks
I'm not going to go through every feature of the 2.0 upgrade but we are getting requests as to how I use this little beauty on a day-to-day basis
the stylus has a tip and there is actually friction as you're writing on the remarkable surface and the tip degrades a tip
I don't know it might be four but this tip is due to be changed but I didn't change it so I can show you
there's a little metal device to grab a hold of the stylus tip but I've never needed it and it pops out and here's what's interesting
I don't know exactly how they do that but I think that's pretty remarkable sorry I could know myself so the tip comes out like this and very smartly
I I got about a dozen of these with my original and now I've had it at least eight or nine months and I haven't used them all yet
I'm not going to go into comparing the two but it's very clear here how this works so it's pretty cool
I have personal activities that I need to keep track of and then I have a non-profit called the private dentist
I'll talk about quick sheets in a minute so I have all of these notebooks now that I have within the Matterhorn folder
I can swipe down and scroll up to previous staff meetings but I hope you can see it here on the overhead camera
I make those ahead as the week is going on and I can go up here to the stylist setting it's set for ballpoint pen right
Joe I want to give Joe a call and I have to do that so now when I go to the page overview back here
I go through all the same exercise that I just showed you and I'm able to shoot this off so for me
I can fill all of this in and these are their numbers now and again I just click on the share button and I can send it
I tap in their email address and I can send them a customized form so I copy myself so I have it for them and then I go back
I can circle a whole bunch of numbers and they disappear so I make my edits I email that to the client
grab this real quickly all right so and I have the the name I put up here the date all the pertinent data all right
I hit the page overview and this just gives me all my quick sheets I hold my finger like this and it highlights now up here
I can make a duplicate and send the duplicate to the other folder and leave that one here which is another cool feature
this was so awful to not have this available on previous versions because I would have to stop and take the time to find the folder
I can make a duplicate and I can move the duplicate over to this other one and you can even move sheets within the same folder
it gives me the bold name of the person or the date and and such so that has been priceless so overall this is how
Fire tablet and the 10 inch version of this model so the Fire HD 8 and the Fire HD 10 are virtually identical
and it's also very light so it's definitely a nicer tablet than I was expecting Amazon usually has a budget tablets
so that's just sort of a look at the hardware like I said it's definitely a lot different than the older of Fire tablets
they got good feeling angles and good color but the resolutions kind of lower like on the Galaxy Tab four line this one
oh you couldn't really do anything with that and like random apps that appear and disappear on the home screen so they did get rid of that you do
you can jump around through the different section and there's also recent section here so this is kind of like the old carousel
just something to keep in mind because audiobooks can be quite large obviously so the screen looks really good when it comes like video games and movies
so there's definitely some good things to be said about the screen it doesn't have the highest resolution but other than that
it's kind of pixelated a little bit too small just the way scales on the screen so I mean in the landscape mode
I was reading some reports online of people having some issues but I touch screen is like 100 percent good like everywhere it always responds well
I'm kind of used to all of the the functionality that it's got but for use of home it's a little bit pricey
Yuans were all battery pen so you had to charge them before before we could use them now they do last a while
the beveled sides are nice because they make it feel nice for holding it as well so if you are kind of picking up and moving around
where you've got the bump in your hands just you can just rest on that part of the pen quite nicely
I do wonder if it's got the eraser built-in again I don't use that but it's a it's it's I guess it's a nice feature for some people
it's kind of a weird shape an uncomfortable shape if you were trying to erase with that but I guess we'll see actually
yeah it stands quite nicely and you can you can put it horizontally so it's got a little little bevel indepent holder
I've one of the main problems I've seen with fury on is the drivers that Lee used to send a bundle which they obviously don't do anymore
I'll basically when I go to get it or get the latest drivers and see how it works and then we've got a cable standard USB cable
after a couple of hours of use it was really easy to install the drivers of put it on both Mac and Windows and it was
I've never used a large into us so I don't know but I imagine that's the same the and the pressure sensitivity was excellent
I had a specific version of the driver that to use but with this one the latest driver is perfectly fine
I guess I'll find out I'll try and keep them updated and see what happens but the ones they're there at the moment seemed perfectly fine so yeah
I'm not fussed about using a screen tablet but in that department as well they seem again huion seem to be really taking
Huy on one and you know give that go especially like someone like me if they had a couple of huion tablets already and they feel like
you'd feel more comfortable going into that route so that will probably do off them over time but yeah like say yeah
it still comes with a dual-core 1.2 gigahertz processor and a BG or and Wireless if you're just looking to update your Facebook watch movies
which is going to allow you to play games and watch movies and do all that kind of good stuff without any interruption
if you want a gaming tablet you absolutely have to check this one out on our website number 5 the infamous
just be prepared to shell out some cash because this one is not cheap remember all the pricing is available in the link beneath this video
number four is by far the best travel tablet that you can currently buy it's the Lenovo yoga 10 inch HD plus tablet
that means that you're going to be able to see every little detail in every movie that you watch this lightning fast
it's the Samsung Galaxy Tab for this amazing tablet comes with over $300 of free content and services and costs less than $200 to buy and get this
so it's not a magnet or anything it just kind of slides in there but it stays put so the dough quality overall for a inexpensive department store
now this one is equipped like all the others are with an Adam Bay Trail processor 2 gigabytes of RAM 32 gigabytes of storage about 21 gigabytes
so you can augment some of that storage if you wish to do that but you know not a lot of processor power not a lot of
I'd be able to plug in an additional USB device on top of what you might plug into there so you've got a lot of USB connectivity options
if you want to store media now the one thing that really got me though speaking of buttons is this one this is the reset button now
when you push it now it is recessed quite a bit but you can push it fairly easily so I was
but you might find yourself hitting that by accident from time to time so just be careful about pushing that button
and you've got a mono speaker over here so don't expect great image quality don't expect sound quality but again for $200 it is certainly usable
we can do all the things we've done on other pcs and it will perform pretty much as well as those do ceilings
I've got a video length above that will give you a few examples of that so there are some things that these things can do
it doesn't feel you know like an expensive computer but it does feel better than many of the other department store brands
pounds overall so a little on the heavy side but when you do pull the screen off you get about half
hi guys how's it going today we're going to be doing a tablet unboxing review this will be of the XP pen artist 12 pro and full disclosure
oh that's so nice a nice note and then more contact information in case you have trouble and then one of these guys
so it's a glove that you put on and it keeps your hand from sticking to the tablet so on hot summer days when your hand is all sweaty
so it's nice that it comes with that so you just put it on like so put it on your drawing hand
that's that's pretty cool very useful so this must be the pen and it looks like it comes with eight pen nibs
and then if you unscrew the bigger cap like it's just stuck in there pull it out and there's your pen so I'm first holding it
I'd have to say like I've tried a bunch of off-brand tablets I feel like XP pen is kind of the best their packaging and their tablets
I've checked the instructions and what it says to do is to plug it into the computer using the HDMI port before installing any of the drivers
um it's a little scary you know if you spent $250 on the thing that's a lot of money you wouldn't want anything happening to it
I'm gonna go to this website here and download our drivers so we'll be right back with getting that so while we're waiting for the drivers to install
and the resolution for it is 1920 by 1080 so it's high-definition resolution which is nice it works on Windows and Macintosh computers pressure sensitivity
when we're trying it out we'll see how that is so pressure sensitivity levels is kind of a moot selling point
finish the first button by default does right click and it looks like the second button switches from eraser to pen ohso
I assume this won't have as accurate of colors as say like a Wacom tablet or you know a nicer computer monitor but first glance it it looks fine
it doesn't look like it's dull or desaturated or anything so once clip studio paint loads will play around with these um shortcut buttons
I have to say like as someone who's messed around with off-brand tablets before this installed no problem my told you Nova tablet
the first thing we can edit is the buttons on the side of the pen so the top button we can have it do nothing right
R function I can press the button on my mouse and I don't know if you can see it in the video
it's on scroll which in a drawing program scroll up scroll down is going to be zoom in and out and this wheel
now it's on plus and minus so again that would be zoom in and out in this program and then we're back to scroll so that's cool
let's choose extend it'll think about it for a bit so now um it's just showing just my desktop background here but what
I'm using this as a second monitor so I can open up references on my laptop and work on this at the same time and have two different displays
there's a Windows ink button down here so if you're not getting pressure sensitivity in a program often times what it is is if you're on PC
so clicking in the wheel doesn't seem to do anything which is fine customize the dial so oh can you click left and right
I wouldn't get used to after a while but it feels a bit like rubber on plastic a little bit when you're drawing so yeah
you have to connect it to a computer somehow and you have this giant cable that connects it but it gives you plenty of space
it's a little small if if you're used to drawing with your whole arm this is kind of a small tablet
you can always do things like this usually in programs where you just expand your canvas and then you have a bigger area to work with
it's just not very heavy and it feels a bit cheap in hand but you know for an inexpensive screen tablet
you're sort of out of luck or you'd have to get a converter or something so just something to keep in mind otherwise
I thought this was a really good tablet and would definitely recommend it for any beginners looking to get into art or animation
The active drawing area on the screen is 21.5 inches and it's in 1920 by 1080 HD resolution. The Parblo Mast 22 connects via HDMI and USB.
This can happen on the top, bottom, left, or right, and it doesn't happen with every single brush stroke, but it happens often enough to be a concern.
For this reason, I recommend that you size your canvas a bit smaller than full screen, that way your brush strokes
The glass on the screen is laminated and bonded, which improves parallax reduction, and the anti-glare surface works really well to diffuse reflections.
I found it difficult to calibrate the display because of the button location and the fact that the colorimeter covers the display options menu.
I have to say, as far as pressure is concerned, this is far better than some of the other alternatives I've tried. Should your pen nib
The parallax on the Mast 22 is decent, but as with many of the Cintiq alternatives, the cursor strays from the pen tip when you tilt the pen.
If you draw quickly, you might not notice this as much, but if you draw slowly, you're definitely going to notice a little bit of wobble in your lines.
However, the upside to that is, if a cable is destroyed, you could always get a generic HDMI or USB cable to replace it.
Now, the Mast 22 can be used to mirror your display or you can extend your display so that you're using multiple monitors at once.
You may also need to go into the Parblo control panel and toggle the screen setting so that the pen is active on the correct monitor.
If you've tried that and the pen still doesn't work on the correct monitor, then you'll need to reinstall or repair the driver.
how you like it, you'll have plenty of room to draw on your canvas with your palettes off to the side.
If you're fairly tech-savvy, you can troubleshoot it and eventually get it to work, but hopefully this is something that can be fixed with a future driver update.
You can angle the tablet from 15 to 85 degrees. Unlike the metal surrounding the screen, the stand is made out of plastic.
If you don't like the stand, I'm not sure that you have many alternatives because this tablet does not have mounting holes for a standard VESA bracket.
After trying the Parblo Mast 22, I was pleasantly surprised at the paper-like feel of the matte screen, the bezel-free design, and the durable metal construction of the tablet.
Albeit basic, the pen has an excellent pressure response, but the jittery and wobbly lines hold the pen back in terms of line quality.
I'm also not a fan of charging pens since even some of the Cintiq alternatives have battery-free pens at this point.
The 21-inch screen is a good size for making art and the color gamut is decent, but the color accuracy suffers a bit and requires calibration.
um brent does a really good job focusing on a lot of the same content that that i do on this channel
this is a really good way for you to consume the video and take the notes but as far as interacting back with your zoom meeting
how do you do that in a way where you're not recording the top portion of your face only which i i won't do
if i click on this this will open up a little tiny window and we are not going to start it
you can adjust these different settings and then when you're inside of a zoom call when you're selecting which camera so you can choose front camera or back camera
i can make this more transparent and i can take my notes and when i want to talk back with him instead of looking down here
Wacom already has the Cintiq Pro Line there's the Cintiq Pro 13 the pro 16 the pro 24 the pro 32 this is the Cintiq 16
they're taking out some of those features that drive up the price of the Cintiq Pro line and and releasing a more stripped-down basic version
for what a stylus should feel like when you're drawing with it but it is kind of hard to put those feelings into words so like all pen displays
I mentioned a little bit earlier from time to time when I would pick up this pen and I would finish an ink line where I left off
it's really handy if you're trying to vary the look of your paintbrush shapes while you're drawing and having tilt support in your pen is actually something
I say it a lot but I think it's a perfect balance between having a good sized screen where the interface is big enough
and you don't have any problems like selecting layers or if you have a brush slider or something it's easy to move around the interface
The Stand works pretty much the way you'd expect it to it's got a little release latch and you can set it at any angle
however along the side of the tablet there is a loop a little place where you can stick your pen which is really handy
are the drivers in the software that you have to install with this when the Cintiq Pro started rolling out almost two years ago I read online
I'm really curious to see if they do this with some of their other sizes as well or if this is gonna be the only one
the vk 1200 drawing monitor provides the battery free pen with 8192 levels of pen pressure and it supports up to 60 degrees of tilt function
the pen has a nice rubber grip and feels really comfortable to hold and last but not least we have the tablet
the tablet has an all metal body so it feels kind of fancy and the back has grips so it doesn't slide around
the tablet can use the computer as its power source in most cases but in some cases it does need to be plugged into a wall outlet
draw your oc mini and the purpose of this drawing is just to test out the tablet and see how it performs
i want to say that he style is very cute and since he gets flustered i wanted to draw him blushing
since it's not an expression i get to draw very often for finished illustrations to pick which character i was going to draw for this video
so that the mouse cursor would be in the correct spot in relation to the pen when i first tried to do this
i'll talk a little about the illustration i'm working on so in a recent video i tried out digital painting and it was a lot of fun
but it wasn't really i was able to adjust to it pretty quickly and it wasn't too different than drawing on something like my ipad
it's really easy for my hand to slide around and it has a slight texture to it so it feels really nice to work on the vik
so thank you all so much for watching this bonus video and i'll see you all on saturday for my usual weekly video bye
lock on release their new entry level into a tablets and they were nice enough to send me one to review
little tablet comes with a pen you can draw on it and what you draw appears on your screen also works on
the medium is larger than the small while we're talking about the actual area of the tablet that you're drawing on
it fits on my desk pretty well so if I move it a little bit off to the side I can draw and use my keyboard shortcuts
I'm only using 10 to 20% of the battery life okay there is one thing that I get really geeky about
the intro's doesn't promise that and it doesn't even really talk about that but that is my favorite part of the
I like that because I always mess up those numbers when I'm doing these videos if I draw really lightly with my ink brush shows up
I'm guilty of keeping my tablet off to the side of my laptop but if I need more accuracy and a lot of people will tell you this
I had to reboot the program in order to actually find those pressure settings but I did get it to eventually work but since the update
Wacom is updating the drivers frequently and trying to iron some of these things out the other drawback is gonna be the price
I mentioned it before it's $80 the small Bluetooth version is $20 more it's a hundred bucks and the medium is $200 there's more good news
I haven't used the Corel programs too much but I have used clips to do ton and I absolutely love Clips to do
it's a little disappointing that you can't get that if you get like the most inexpensive version that software alone runs you about fifty dollars
I think it's totally worth fifty dollars so if you can get the one with Bluetooth to also get that software
I would totally recommend it but rest assured this tablet is gonna work with pretty much any software out there mostly
I'm hoping to get a storytime animation out later this week probably on Wednesday fingers crossed might not make it until next week
wow and the connectivity is wi-fi this is external slot sd card and auto audio jack and gravity 360 degree gravity induction and language supports multiple languages
wow it is super cool is written here and let me open this side and we also have put the protector
so let's try this g tag so and start let me read it two seconds and one second read it now
and let's open this dab guys now i will show you the apps of this cheetah so look this is the i mean
google go and also here settings settings fx again fm radio gmail camera fm radio music contacts play play store calculator calendar gallery whatsapp and sound recorder
it also comes with a one-year subscription to the fire for kids unlimited making it a better choice for parents it also has a longer warranty than the original
that will protect the tablet from your children's daily abuse the Amazon Fire HD 10 kids Edition is basically the same 10 inch tablet as the original model
it comes with a bulky rubber case that will give the tablet some good protection from accidental drops and it also gives the tablet a better grip
inch screen 1920 by 1200 resolution panel that provides sharp images and texts the Amazon fire HP 10 kids Edition comes with an IPS panel
good enough performance for its price point and more than enough to handle your children's needs it has a storage of 32 gigabytes which is a decent space
hi this is chris garcia with my tablet life comm and here is our review of the Sylvania seven-inch mini tablet
I've seen not not comparative to say the Samsung Galaxy Tab but possibly better than the viewsonic G tablet probably but on par with halawi s7
that's a little better on the sylvania is it has a rubberized back so that makes it a little nicer feel
Mira mainly all of your ports and everything are pretty much on the one side here and what you have is your mini SD card your mini HDMI out
you have your speaker which is of average quality here is your stylus comes out right there and you have a reset button that you may need to use
the met the power button also works as a back button to however these buttons are pretty recessed and very difficult to use
UI does give you some on-screen buttons home back menu volume up and down so you do have those right there
so that's that's kind of an issue battery life about three to four hours at most not that 8 to 10 hours
you could take pictures with this device however there is no camera on this device and actually what that button does is it
is you actually have to use the button to change your orientation so there is no you know accelerometer on the device itself
so you're not going to get orientation change automatically you have to change it on your own that comes with some widgets in this
that's on their alarm clock calculator sound recorder slide which is a slide me which is an apps market not very many applications on their contacts
so that's pretty much all you have on the device when you get out of the box and your music your media center your browser and your email
let's go to the browser for a second it is Android 2.1 device so it's your regular browsing as far as android 2.1
goes since this is resistive touch you do not have pinch-to-zoom you just have to double tap to zoom in and out
I don't see how some issues not having an accelerometer is gonna be a problem for a lot of games though
I think it's pretty much just a little bit of a step up from the Augen Jen touch 78 possibly in the right direction
yeah and none of these you got the trash control all that cut off and like you can paint all that cut off
record songs are saved on their videos and bet the Bluetooth so a lot of people ask me a lot I do
I needed to do anymore so I'm gonna go ahead and go deeper into the video so right here this is the Bluetooth steady
go to press that they press say input code right here to connect you just go to search and press the green button
if y'all can read y'all see what it's a car speed warning sound everything you also got her arm but it was the thing called a radar
this is the steering wheel control so the steering wheel does work with this man so I'm gonna give you our example man
HD I'll just like quick assets and then this is a AC for itself so you got if you just cut it on right here
got here blonde code and you got the heat right now and say hi turnout over down up down - what night - isn't a premium so
TV is like kind of like falling like following link is like you can hook it up you can plug it up through
Wi-Fi Android Wi-Fi iPhone Wi-Fi or enjoy USB and there's green whatever whatever you wanted to show on the tablet here show that so that's where iPhone link
I'm saying so you got the Wi-Fi right now connected the Xfinity Wi-Fi data usage all that other good stuff you know regular tablet stuff
he's gonna load up all your apps you got open just swipe delete boom boom boom boom boom a boom boom right here imma go battle me
file manager just gonna show you everything on earth a SD card on the tablet SD card like I said a camera
that's lit man so that's about everything on it man if I got any questions hit me up the other day I do
oh yeah also backup camera when you put it in reverse it's gonna automatically pop up - neon pop up here pop up when they want to for super
Faye is not popular now because they don't have a camera to register but you put in it when you put it in the reverse the Kent
Erica the goober if you're new to my channel I am a freelance digital illustrator and character designer in this video
I did do an unboxing video of this tablet on my Instagram story which I have saved to my Instagram TV
I'm gonna let you in on a pro tip the wireless USB thingy is underneath the tablet under a little hinged door
PIN is in range of the tablet if it's connected if it's charging or if it's low on battery it's really nice to have these status indicators
so you don't get surprised when your tablet is dead or if you are wondering if it's connected or not last but not least
Wacom tablet in this size drawing area and the closest one I found was not even as big of a drawing area
I found was $500 with the same pin pressure levels currently this tablet is on sale on Aliexpress for 115 dollars and 50 cents which is even more insane
just put the shortcut for eraser on your customizable buttons and last thing about the pin it has to be charged which is really annoying
I didn't have batteries but I know it would be pretty annoying if you went to go draw and it died
I have a certain like hand position that I use and it comes very naturally to me so not having it
it was just really strange and hard to get used to but eventually I kind of like got into the groove of using it a different way
if you're looking to upgrade from a smaller tablet or if you're looking for a nice tablet to start digital art with
if you'd like to see your name in the credits of my youtube videos you can check out the patreon in the link in the description
what we have is a home button and dual front-facing speakers which are actually unate rusev and they sound pretty decent for a tablet
you'll get the usual as the card slot which runs at USB 2.0 speeds which I have tested with this Samsung 64 gigabyte
a micro USB OTG port where you can get an additional USB port a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and the power button right on top of the left side
enable/disable key right here which can get pretty handy when you have an external mouse or you want to type something without your hands
hopefully we'll see one this year and a quick look at the device manager we can see that the storage device is actually a SanDisk
but what's more important if we go ahead and move on down here it's actually running a real Tech Wi-Fi chip instead of an Intel
Wi-Fi or AC Wi-Fi which is actually a bummer especially for a temple like this and especially for 2017 slash 2018
I have to do is to actually go ahead and take a look at the performance playing games doing some light photo editing and testing out this speaker
I mean don't do it but if you just wanted some casual gaming here and there then you can run a Counter Strike anything more like rocket League
gigahertz so if you do plan to have some 4k footage then you can easily play it with this laptop as long as you get the connection
I have tried to match the camera settings with what I've seen in real life so it looks more realistic and yeah it looks actually that severe
even though it's not advertised to it seems like they are using some kind of panel that are shared with the other tablets
no this is not a pressure-sensitive pen it's just the type the charges and simply draws on the screen with no pressure sensitivity
look pretty good but it has light lead and the brightness is not that bright and no it does not have any ghosting
inch, this is a 10 inch version, and they made some nice upgrades to it that makes it overall a better purchase for point of sale.
You can also go portrait so if you want to use your point of sale software in portrait mode, it has that capability in it as well.
There is also some additional accessories like customer displays, 1D, 2D barcode scanners that can be built into it as well as different mounting options.
When you take it out of the base, there's an optional hand strap on the back, it fits nicely so you can do one-handed operation.
If you're taking orders or something like that then you don't have to worry about dropping the tablet, there's a little strap on this
There's one micro USB port on the back if you do need to plug in a USB peripheral, then that port is there.
Most point of sale equipment uses full size USB connections, not mini, but it is there if you want to get an adapter and plug something in.
Overall, a pretty cool new computer from Pioneer, worth taking a look if you want a more compact, small, semi-portable point of sale system.
not only are we going to take a look at some of the advancements that xp pen has made for this tablet
but this one you need a computer and right now i have both of these drawing tablets connected to my mac pro
there's not a lot of buttons so if you look on my cintiq there's some buttons on either side of the screen
those do come in handy but for the most part when i'm drawing or doing anything on the computer i'm using all the keyboard shortcuts
those are programmable that's fine but still i'm still using the keyboard so this doesn't bother me at all that there's no buttons
my cintiq is connected to this ergo arm so i'm able to move this around and it's still connected to the desk
grab that pull it and it comes down when you release it it clicks into place so now we don't have to worry about this slipping at all
just pull that handle and it clicks into place while we're back here let's take a look at all the connections this first one is the power
when you get the xp pen you get a usbc to usbc cable you also get a usbc to usb a cable and you also get the hdmi cable
i guess for when you're drawing and now the newer ones the newer xp pen ones have a little bit of a flare
you can show display number if you have multiple displays set to full screen and then you can also take a look at the tablet and display
and here's some more like if you wanted to rotate this 90 degrees so you can draw more portrait mode now
i have adobe photoshop open i have sketchbook but we're not going to play with that right now let's go down
one of the biggest differences is that this is not an eraser currently the way this stylus is set up is the top button of this rocker switch
if i tap it it switches from brush to eraser and if i tap it again it goes back to brush
so if you're working on an xp pen and you have this stylus and you're trying to paint something but the paint isn't happening
so let's get that there and make sure that we have our pencil and i don't know maybe we're drawing huh
every time i come out with something new you'll be alerted and we can do all of this cool creative stuff together all right
i hope this video finds you safe and i hope this video finds you healthy and i will see you in the next one later you
you'll notice once you get this tablet in your hands is how thin it is after all six point four millimeters is the measurements on the thickness
the signature silver power button and volume rockers are on the left complete with the stiff but meaty press to them a headphone
does well to provide that much more comfort in usage finally on the back the material is of a plastic that is somewhere between hard and soft touch
you need to perform basically anything that the Android ecosystem has to offer and while the high resolution of the screen might be somewhat to blame for this
the bits and pieces that are found underneath the surface of the z2 tablet include that wide array of connectivity tools
the sound could use a little bit more richness but ultimately for a media consumption device like this tablet they are a very very welcome addition
the experience software experience is largely what you may already be used to from other experiences this time just blown up for a tablet size
but honestly the both of them don't really offer anything more than a stylized way of looking at content that may already be available on the
Sony shows us that even though the things I it puts into its devices might not ultimately be useful for a number of people out there
at least they don't come off as bloat and bog down the system which eventually mean that the Xperia UI is one of the better streamlined Android
Sony style is really sometimes hard to deny and the Xperia z2 tablet does feel premium enough in a number of respects to ultimately justify its higher cost
we got stuff coming for you all the time and in the next few weeks you're gonna see a lot of great content that
Second, I used the 27QHD beast all those years with only the attached feet because I didn’t want to spend $500 on a stand.
The tension is adjustable, so if it’s too hard or easy to push down, or tilt, it’s an easy fix with the tool it comes with.
I was always scared to get a monitor arm because I thought the 20 - 30 pound tablet would crush it.
Every day I had to turn it on and off again a couple times for it to sync to the right resolution.
Five years of drawing. No dead pixels. No scratches. What I enjoy about the old beast: it’s quiet. Mean while the Cintiq 24 Pro has a fan.
Ugh. So if it’s driving you as crazy as it did me, tweak the settings. Also, the magnet on the left side of my Cintiq 24
Every screen tablet has these problems, because the developers have to constantly change the tablet software to match ever-changing operating system and drawing program updates.
Some companies keep on top of updates much faster for more programs than others. In fact some non-Wacom tablets are completely incompatible with 3D art
But the 24 Pro, the 24 Pro is a sleek, sexy velociraptor whirring loudly through the jungle, cutting through canvases with its buttery smooth claws.
so this tablet currently retails around 30 to 40 dollars for the basic set so they do have others on there
I've seen it comes in a basic cardboard box which was a little bit better by the time it got to me but the tablet inside was fine
then you also receive the pen instruction manual and driver information spare nibs and the metal tool that you use to change them over and two adapters
the tablet was easy to set up and install and I didn't have any issues with the driver it's always important as a note to uninstall any other tablets
I tried this out on the usual computer that I use when I'm reviewing tablets which is my Dell Latitude a6 four-one-oh running Windows 7
I found is that the USB cable is attached to the tablet and is not removable and it's also fairly short about 1 meter long
also it means if your cable is damaged you can't replace it without replacing the whole tablet and at 30 pounds
it feels kind of like the pen that came with a Samsung tablet I used to have previously which was more intended for note-taking rather than long art sessions
Wacom pens so you can see how much thinner it is and it doesn't have a grip they're about the same length but it is much thinner
it also doesn't have an eraser which may be a point of note for people who may use an eraser a lot
but it's definitely an interesting idea if you prefer to work with a tablet in portrait format the shortcut buttons pressed down with a solid click
if you draw on stream you might not want to put your mic too close to the tablet just as a heads up
to scroll up and scroll down the tablet has 8,192 levels of pressure sensitivity which is pretty impressive for the price
you have marks for active area and there's also a little light which indicates when the pen is touching the tablet
so you'd be able to tell whether there's any problems with the input by pressing the pen down and see if it lights up
Sai I chose this because I wanted to digitally paint a portrait and I can't get along with clip studio as water brushes yet
you can disable it in the tablet software but sometimes it's also switched on in clips to do itself and for some reason
I've known people who love XP pen tablets and I know people who haven't so I had no idea what to expect as with previous tablets
it's just been business as usual but this will be my last video of 2019 and I just passed 25,000 subscribers which is absolutely phenomenal and crazy
I mean I got one when I was like really young it was super cheap and I got bored of it within like a week
well you don't even have to put your pen all the way down but you know that's not recommended so as you can see it's pretty smooth occasionally
let's let's do her if I can remember her okay so I know she has like I know she has like a bird head ish
and then on the back it says that it has 8,192 levels of pen pressure sensitivity which is wild in my opinion and for reference
I got my first ever tablet and I was really young at the time and i 100% did not deserve it
I'm assuming it's going to feel supernatural as if I'm actually using a pencil to draw on paper so I'm really excited about that
like we have come a long way to have pen pressure sensitivity like this for literally 29.99 amazing in this box
let's see your pen which has like this interesting sharkbite kind of like indent here kind of like a shark white shark bite
because on the way comms it has the little nib where when you turn it over it acts as an eraser automatically so when
I delete my first sketch layer because I no longer need that and then I start my liner and so far
I'm just surprised by the fact that when I first about digital art and that I needed a tablet in order to to create it
I've just about finished my liner and one thing I do want to mention as I was doing my line art
here as you can see mm-hmm all right delete gets rid of it completely there we are at the same time
it's basically just selecting all this area and it does make the coloring process or at least the coloring like blocking in process go faster so now
I'm not really liking these lips and this is why I love digital arts so much because I can just make a new layer over top
they're like markings that she puts on her face and they change every time depending on kind of what they signify
I don't know if I don't know if it's me or if it's the program basically is what I'm getting at
so let's get right into this so first up we have got three different models here so this is the base the cheapest model this is the
the one does not have any buttons at all and you can see the size differences on these so the one is a little bit wider this direction
Bluetooth I'm not really sure but keep that in mind you might end up having to use it wired if you're on
it's not great compared to like the trackpad on the Mac it works decent but I I found no use for it myself
it's got one that's a little bit longer on the top and short one on the bottom and I'll show you how it program these to use in Photoshop
I didn't slip in your hand so much but it's it's a decent pen it's not it doesn't feel amazing like the pro does but it feels decent
I set this to be option space so if I come into Photoshop and hold down this top button then what that does is it
what you can do is turn on this pressure sensitivity and this one's gonna change the opacity based upon how hard you press so here
I'm pressing really light so it starts out with just applying a little bit and then as I press harder it starts playing the full effect
I want to darken or the sky so I could flip this to black and you can see in this case
I want to darken the top of the sky and if I want to lighten the top of this peak here so that's too big of a brush
Photoshop drawing menu so you can then easily pick different tools from this so I can quickly go to the clone stamp tool or you can hit that again
I've shown you are the small size tablet and these also come in medium and large so they get a lot bigger than this
on so this whole tablet is being mapped to just monitor two but then if I go to all other applications then
so that's just a tip if you want to keep with a small tablet size and you have dual monitors if you have a single monitor then
I think the small works just fine if you have dual monitors and don't want to do that whole mapping thing then
you might try both or at least try the small out first and see if it works for your needs most likely it will
I'm gonna have a lot more stuff coming on my channel so please subscribe and be seeing you guys in the future you
and you can get the drivers right here which will download right after the unboxing and I'm gonna be testing it out on the Mac
it comes in a very small compact and a sturdy box it actually kind of resembles somewhat of an iPhone box
I got the graphics drivers as you can see it once installed it gives you a few basic options so we can select
that are you know you'll find pretty common tablets now you can adjust the buttons and the shortcuts on here as well now what
I'm finding under you know the technical side of a lot of this so it is the it's not just my pen button or anything and it is working
which of course brings up my brush list here that I can use to draw so what I often like to do
you're not gonna find some of the options that it'll just like allow you to do see like pen tilt and stuff not a
I have here this image that I work in progress as I find the the form of action and really you know plan out this composition
I like the architecture at this point is literally just a few geometric shapes like squares rectangles couple triangles work in AI
I can change that language at any point doing a little bit of racing and stuff but yeah then we'll get in and playing the lighting
so maybe this will be like in a future video as I kind of finish planning this out and going forward with it but thank you for watching
as a typing and web browsing device not to forget to mention it comes pre-loaded with windows 10 and free trial subscription of office 365
joy has been well known for selling affordable two-in-one windows devices since its entry to the malaysian market while the company sns network isn't the hardware manufacturer
it has certainly done a good job by partnering with intel and microsoft in offering affordable hardware running on windows 10.
the new joy 11 reminds me dearly of the first generation apple ipad and to be honest i have mixed feelings about the hardware design this round
however the device's storage has been slashed by hop to 32 gigabytes and is being split into two partitions for windows and android the 10.8
panel has a full hd resolution that looks decent when viewing content and it even has its proprietary digitizer that accepts drawing input from an optional joy
there are two loud speakers located at both sides of the tablet and it has a 5 megapixel main and 2 megapixel front camera
occasionally it mises my input as i type fast and most of the time i'll have to hammer my fingers on the keys
it is a less comfortable experience compared to the old joy 11. however if you want a better typing experience on the new droid 11
ram the tablet still sadly gets challenged when more browser tabs are open while streaming music from spotify at the same time
though i have never find the need to use it during my review period i can imagine using it if i am thinking to
when you run on windows i recommend charging the device when running on android or powered off because it takes a while to get charged
I just want to say gal maan provided me a free tablet for review and there are links in the description as per gal
it's got a button on it like some love and care went into this opening it up you got a whole buttload of nubs and such for the pen
I assume because it doesn't have a battery and the one I'm used to has one so the heft is different
it also comes with your standard drivers and warranty and paper stuff so I gotta say it's a pretty decent tablet
it's super easy to set up the hotkeys and I love the fact that everything's just right there to edit pen pressure and work area
I don't like about this tablet are few like you'll find a bit of a delay when using any of your hotkeys on the side
I don't know what caused it but it is rather suspicious that it only ever happened while working on it with this tablet to wrap up this review
so thanks the gal mod for letting me review this tablet you can check them out in the description below and thank you all for going through this video
if you're trying to use this for a reading or anything off those sorts now my favorite thing about this tablet is actually its design
I have put this thing through the wringer to see if I can recommend it to you guys after looking for a budget
this thing retails for about 250 dollars but I've seen it on sale for 230 and even as low as 175 on Black Friday and yes
this thing looks like a pretty good deal for $250 in a real bargain if you can get it for 175 so without further ado
the template blew me away with was a low distance between the actual pen and the cursor on the screen this is called parallax
I'm gonna bring attention to this red dial setting this to rotate the canvas while painting in Krita really proved to be helpful for making strokes with good leverage
within the driver software there are also some pre-loaded functions such as setting one key to switch routine brush and eraser the only con
Pleasant it feels so natural to draw on it's fun to use the red dial in creative ways and I just enjoy using this thing
the stand only lifts the tablet 20 degrees off of your surface which is way too low an angle for me and my neck
I wouldn't call it not portable but it is definitely not very concise you have the USB see that plugs into the tablet HDMI and USB
you can hide these wires behind a desk but you on-the-go users aren't really so fortunate however the USBC connection and that's on the tablet side is nice
allow you to focus on your drawing workflow without having to keep a keyboard nearby and as a bonus it's technically portable
I'm already mostly full of the memory so it's not a lot but obviously if you are using it for your kids
or that's just like how the tablet is but just follow that rule and now the tablet has been great at keeping out with a great battery life
so when you see like productivity apps that's me but for the rest of them if my phone will do that it hand with geometry dash and math games
but it's not exactly designed to be a high quality camera taking but it does have a camera which is see if
just keep your kids like only on one app instead of scrolling through the internet or join any where they're not supposed to it can help them
i was surprised to find out that a company called gaomon that makes drawing tablets reached out to me and asked
to send me something called the galman m10k 2018 and that is quite the tongue twister for me so while unboxing it came with pretty basic things
i thought it'd be too small but no it's quite snug in there so with everything taken out i might as well start using it
because here's the thing if you're interested in getting into digital art and you want a nice tablet then i would definitely recommend this one
um this yeah the this the the way it's connected to the tablet and the fact that it faces the cord faces away from me and not towards me
hi guys this is Leslie from Leslie loves veggies and I'm here today and I wanted to show you the in
once you've taken pictures you can go to your photos once you've taken video you can go to your video and it's even got an mp3 player
I also purchased a car adapter which has an extra long cord so of both the backseat which is really nice
all these things also work with mobi go to which we also have thank you mom central so he loves the camera
I'm kind of keeping him working the stylus right now because he tends out a little bit of a heavy hand with that
yeah so but he loves it and um it's just so much fun for him so um I'm gonna be downloading a few more
it's just there's so many different apps is so much we can do with it and it grows with him and that's what
please show some support for the channel and help us grow by subscribing chatting to us in the comments below and hitting that thumbs up button okay
so the pebble gear tablet has been designed with kids in mind and the tablet offers access to an array of games and ebooks as well
this version i have here is the frozen edition but they do do a mickey mouse one toy story and cars editions
the sound is average just a single speaker facing the rear which isn't ideal cameras are grainy and don't take a very good picture
and you can always upgrade that with a separate sd card if you wanted from my six-year-old's point of view she loved it and thought it worked perfectly
there isn't too many menus or options it has a very child-friendly interface now on to one of the key features of the tablet and that's its parental controls
the emphasis on the usage of the tablet is prominent and it allows you to set which days time frames and the duration
only being able to read stories between say 7 and 8 p.m at night and not games which i'm okay with you can also monitor play time reading time
lastly if you wanted to treat your child to some extra time in the tablet because they've been good or something
pebble has this paid subscription service because all the apps are ad free and they don't include any of those in-app purchases either you've seen the headlines
my daughter played a number of games which i helped her with but when it was my turn i tried a few games
that's because it can flip around and turn into a tablet mode now this is a Windows feature where you can actually enable tablet mode and once you do
but yeah it's it's pretty much in tablet mode and you could like rotate this however you want and use it whichever way you need
16-ounce cup of coffee that's about the weight it has a built-in webcam almost feels like they put it in after the fact it's a 0.3
as far as battery life it's got a 4,500 milliamp hour battery which lasts about four and a half hours and I could tell you after using it
I'd rather use this over my laptop when I'm in bedroom setting where I'm watching TV with my wife or a living room
meanwhile sometimes I just want to use this mode instead now as far as the CPU is and I keep going back to the CPUs yes I understand
CPU but for my use cases I rather like it on the CPU and yes can I do with a better CPU
RAM I am going to convert this to Linux and I've been actually honestly waiting to finish this video so I could format this
install Linux and see how that runs because that actually does a little bit better as far as memory management remember the send your notifications for that video
so yeah if you guys enjoyed this video please hit that like button if you guys got any questions about this unit hit in the comments below you guys
this was provided to me by the folks over at XP pen however this is not a sponsored video so all of the opinions contained herein are my own
you know that feeling when someone makes you watch a movie or a show and you resist and you keep telling yourself
a laminated display is where they reduce the amount of space between the glass and the screen underneath it to give you more accuracy when you're drawing
now the glass of the screen itself is a glossy finish it's not as glossy as say drawing on an Android or an iPad
there is a little bit of drawing resistance here so your pen isn't just gonna go flying all over the place without any control to it at all
the Blacker's are blacker so it's a trade-off what are you personally looking for better colors or a little bit more control you are gonna see some parallax
that's where you can see some space between where your pen tip is and where the cursor appears on the screen again
first of all you're gonna find the display itself you're also gonna find connector cables it's got an HDMI / USB / power cable
there's a couple different plugs for that adapter so if you have an international outlet you can plug it in there
oh the pen we got to talk about this little guy okay short version on the pen it is really good
Wacom pens the pen itself feels good to hold it is fairly light and it's fairly narrow but I found it to be pretty comfortable
I've seen I've said this in other reviews I'm gonna say it again until I die this for me personally is the number one thing
I'm not finding that pressure curve blowing out anywhere along the line and I'm not getting any kind of fish hooks in my line as I draw quickly
I think my favorite display size to draw on is the 15 to 16 inch size and I was really surprised when I got used to
I did have to move the cord around a little bit but it was long enough where I could do that
okay ladies and gentlemen we back in the command center man as i promised to bring you another unboxing here we go again yeah
also i told you it's all about the community you know and letting you guys know what's going on if we can
you know we could all look at some of this stuff up on the phone but that takes all the fun out of it
we'll have a further future video where we do do some demonstrations on art and by the way speaking of art ladies and gentlemen this
if you know the anime tune in and check these tips out and how i demonstrate and create your favorite anime characters
i've experienced that on the street fighter main arcade game i tried to wipe it off with some tissue and scratch my screen but i got another one ordered
you got me you you got up volume up volume down auto and then i think we got some connections on the side
vga out we got the power uh power display and we got the plug where you hook it up to your computer
i forget what that connection is called but we have it and if you guys know what that connection is put it in the comments for me
okay and it's rubbery right here got rubber and grip right here so and the tip itself feels as well like rubber
that's nice so we're gonna we're gonna come back in the next video with this hurry on and we're gonna put everything together
okay okay um knowingly the power cord got to be in the box and it looks like what is this an intro tech how much i think
what a eight volt 14 volt power supply or something like that but it doesn't it takes about as much as a power as the laptop does so
okay if it's not for that i don't know what it's for but anyway and we look like we got our standard vga vga
yeah yeah you'll see when i get on it but anyway these are all the things you get in the box with the screws you did
yeah and the most important thing you get is the dongle so you're not running running around running around right around
um we got uh something set up uh locally with uh out at the mall not running on times square mall you know
you know what i mean street fighter something you know some pac-man miss pac-man y'all know what i'm talking about them games they're unbelievable actually and cruising
we'll be displaying this and doing art on it so that's gonna be it for this video until next time from the command center we'll highlight
this is the hannspree titan - it's a 13.3 inch Google Android tablet with a 1920 by 1080 resolution so Full HD screen now
I'm going to tell you a little bit more about the specs but then I really just want to concentrate on whether this is a worthwhile purchase
we talked about the actual display quality in a short while and it has got cameras a 2 megapixel front facing camera a 5 megapixel rear facing camera
other than to say they are mediocre in performance as with most tablets apart from maybe the iPad pro and the iPad air cameras on tablets
now has got a lot of ports on this tablet as well and this is the tablet itself it is a large large tablet
let's hope they at least get it up to version 6 in a future update as well but the actual performance
USB and also a micro USB host ball we've also got HDMI and that's a micro HDMI then we've got a headphone output
because when you're holding it it gives you something to hold on to without accidentally interacting with the screen so I don't mind those larger bezels
With the S20 priced at $134.99 and the S21 at S109.99, both models fall within the mid-range tablet category at a price to suit your pocket.
The S20’s front facing camera is slightly to the top right, and the camera on the S21 is directly at the top center.
To the back of both models has an 8MP rear facing camera, but the S10 comes with a flash, whilst the S21 does not.
Another difference is that the S21 has its internal speakers facing to the back, while the S20 has its speakers at the bottom edge.
you have a slim slot to insert a microSD card, whilst the S21 is has a long snap off cover that you have to remove the access the port.
Their display is powered by the same the GPU which is the PowerVR Rogue GE 8322, with a refresh rate of 60Hz and open GL ES version 3.2 support.
I installed the same game on both models to test their graphics handling, and I’ll be using a Bluetooth gamepad to play this game on both models.
In summary the S20 and S21 are very similar, but the S20 has more RAM and slightly better performance than the S21.
i'm going to be reviewing the gaomin pd1161 graphics tablet before i start um i just want to apologize quickly for having two tablet reviews back-to-back
the packaging was pretty minimalistic and it does a good job of protecting the tablet and the tablet specifications are on the back of the box
i was pretty excited about trying out this tablet because my first ever graphics tablet was actually a galman so i've already had a positive experience with their brand
um with the protector on you can leave it on depending on your preference but i did notice that it seemed to affect the colors quite a bit once
as compared to my wacom pen the nib also appears to be a lot bigger than my wacom pen's nib which is a plus
the fix turned out to be just clicking a box to allow administrator privileges and i was very happy with how receptive their customer service was other than that
basically you just press the menu button and then use the plus minus buttons to navigate the menu button is also the select button
i adjusted my back lighting all the way up and the brightness to my liking i also adjusted the colors a little bit to be cooler
uh this is pretty normal for a tablet that's around 200 which is an entry level price for a screen tablet
this was the only other significant issue i had with the tablet and honestly it didn't bother me as much as i thought it would overall
tablet and a screen tablet and it's pretty portable because of its size so it's been very convenient for me to use while i'm moving houses
i do prefer bigger tablets but the size has been advantageous for working on bigger pieces as well because the screen is smaller
but i don't know i'm pretty self-conscious about my voice and i totally understand if you prefer uh silent videos that have like music in the background either way
i hope this video helped you out a little and please consider checking out either my shop or my kofi as a way to support me
i mean speaking of price gown man also wanted me to let you know about um uh uh that i'm a little bit
XP pen was kind enough to send me this tablet for free to review for you guys today and that's exactly what I'm gonna do opening the box up
you will get this bag which will includes different things which we'll be looking at later and it also comes with a battery free stylus
Express keys you can customize them to however you want them to be and they're already built in USB cable in this little bag that also came in
it also comes with a pen clipper and 10 replacement nibs and also USB adapters because this tablet actually works with your Android device
being part of the actual food was something that I really wanted to do and I really liked how she turned out
they liked how the drawing was looking and they just didn't know what to do with the background as well so
it's working and when you are using it with your pen if you keep your pen pressed onto the tablet the light is gonna keep lighting
I really like how it looks and and everything and all the functions it has I totally recommend it for beginners but also for I guess experienced artists
I have don't have to put any batteries in which is great so that means I can draw without having the thought of
I can't continue drawing because I have to charge it or maybe I need batteries and I don't have any batteries
run to the store to buy batteries and there are no stores in the town but I have to go outside of town yeah
I kind of struggle with that but I'm getting used to it and I'm gonna keep using this tablet because my old one it's kind of broken
because that's when everything went downhill with my tablet and if you follow me on Instagram you know what happens so yeah do
this is a really cool writing tablet as well as an e-reader and there's some really special features that i think you're going to enjoy before we get started
i just want to let you know that if you see bubbles on the screen that's from the included screen protector
it's a very sleek and minimal looking device and it feels great in the hand it has a nice weight to it
i've been using the transfer pdf feature quite a bit as you can see and transferring textbooks and novels that i'm reading with my class over to the device
and that's what i use by default as you can see it's fast and responsive when you're flipping through the pages
books nova 3 covers a lot of different categories and tries to do a lot of things and it does them quite well
Toughbook is certified to withstand shock vibration rain sand deaths high altitude high and freezing temperatures and a six-foot rock some tough features of this test
20 also comes with a shock mounted solid-state hard drive that protects against data loss from drops and bumps the panasonic
USB 3 ports a USB 2 port a regular SD card reader another HDMI port and a VGA connection to CF
I'm gonna be taking a look at an all-new 10-inch tablet available at Walmart from a company called on now this is Walmart's Electronics brand
SD card and I have tested a 128 gigabyte card in here micro USB for charging our volume rocker and our power button
surprisingly the 10 inch version has dual speakers the 8 inch version only has a single speaker setup they both run the same operating system
that one's a 10 inch one's an 8 inch but looking at it here reveals that you're getting a lot more screen with this unit
10 will blow this thing out of the water but one thing that the on tablet has that the fire 10 doesn't is Android 9.0
Android gameplay some emulation and I'll do some video playback for the CPU we get a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core MediaTek 81 93
so as of making this video it's got an up-to-date android security patch built in but with all of these Cheaper Android tablets
networks rated at 400 megabits down and 25 up this thing got ninety point five down and around 23 up not that bad and it's perfect for streaming
I figured we'd have a lot of stuttering going on and I'm sure when there's explosions on screen and a few extra characters
I'm using retro arts right now to emulate SNES using snes9x and here's the Super graphics game running at full speed
all of that's gonna work fine on this tablet and even native video playback is gonna work fine using Cody or VLC whatever
this tablet costs about two hundred and fifty bucks two hundred dollars on sale on Amazon and it comes with this pen and this donut holder
I'm just gonna draw like a little like face or something like it's really good and now I'm gonna do speed art
again you have more of the specs on the back of the box and now the unboxing here is the tablet
oh sorry the two is the brush and now we can see that it's switched to the brush and I want to switch to the erase tool then
I usually press while working so I'll probably keep working using this tablet and then try to use it without actually using the keyboard
this one definitely feels much more comfortable than the s 56k because it has a similar gloss texture as my Cintiq so definitely feel more accustomed to this texture
I started off when I was still using the genius tablet and then I upgraded to the Genova and then I switched to the Cintiq a couple years ago
Chin's you know they say the more tired you are the more Chin's appear let's make my lips a little crusty - I pretty much just making myself
yes yes and just gonna add some shading which is pretty much just coloring this whole inner crater of my face
it's just my eyebrows just do not exist and I'm too lazy did I'll just draw a big block here maybe I'll raise one
I think just it was pretty much plug and play at that point so I really appreciated that so yeah thanks for watching see ya you
Brad Linder with Lola pooting and this is a Dell XPS 11 which looks like an ultrabook and it basically is
Windows 8 apps like Netflix or Kindle and use it either as a tablet or as a notebook or some combination thereof it has pretty nice effects
so you can sort of feel where one key and the next one begins but when you're typing you're actually just tapping on the screen
Dell says the one of the choices here was that the reason that they went with this sort of unusual keyboard is that this is a tablet first design
Dell also offers an XPS 12 laptop that has a physical keyboard and also has a different sort of mechanism for switching over into into tablet mode
so if you really want a device with a keyboard they recommend getting the XPS 12 the XPS 11 on the other hand
but you wouldn't really want to write the the Great American Novel or even the horrible American novel using this keyboard
I think it's been the most frustrating part of using this laptop especially considering in all other ways it's pretty nice in terms of speed performance portability
all the icons became really really tiny down there in the bottom and if I rebooted it would also make some of the other items look tiny as well
I've ever trained used for transcoding audio and video files and so forth but reasonably fast works pretty well for loading resource intensive applications like image editing application
so if you do need extra battery life you're going to need to use some sort of external battery pack or just
because they're really sort of pitching this as a tablet that also happens to work as an ultrabook and that would be a great deal
maybe seven eight hundred dollars but this device starts at about a thousand dollars this particular configuration with the core i5 processor and 128 gigs of storage four
it's a little bit weird to interact with this on an 11.6 inch 2.5 pound device it's the sort of thing where you can see
it's a lot more comfortable than lifting it so anything that you sort of get into this size and this weight
the screen has a useful factory installed screen protector finger gestures on the display were responsive and smooth viewing angles and colors are excellent throughout
unless you increase the volume to 40 percent it does get quite loud at maximum levels but the audio begins to distort from the weakly powered speakers overall
you can happily catch up with family on zoom or chromecast a movie from disney plus the max 10 runs a clean almost stock android 9.0
of course there's the recent world of cloud gaming that you can use the max 10 with no need for top
buying this tablet it has a large 10.1 inch full hd display that is sharp and comfortable for content consumption working from home or studying
and of course you can always play cloud gaming on it plug in some decent headphones to compensate for the poor audio speakers

Caltech my friends over a dragon-type sent me an m7 Android tablet and asked me to do an highness review and lucky for them that's what I do
you can see what they do on the bottom a little better volume up volume down power and reset and for reset
I hate blow air like I hate to put Samsung on blast but man to Samsung have a lot of blow air and it has android 9.0
sdram it says it has a three hour battery life so we'll see how that goes 2 megapixel rear webcam and battery is included
so that's my biggest downfall on this device is the camera there's a front facing and rear and I tried to put a flashlight app on here
its older older hardware older tech but it is pretty amazing how they got the older tech to work so nice was the new
well you know a couple more watts to make the speaker a little louder but the speaker design is pretty sweet
you can hear the sound from anywhere on the bezel so you can stick your ear anywhere around the Machine and hear it like the speaker is located there
she loaded up pretty nice not bad at all and I click play just to show you how long it takes to load up a movie see
it does allow for $60 $60 tablet it does a lot and it does alone and another great thing about this tablet
it doesn't have any bloat where it has just enough apps on it when you first get it so you can run
it's just got very basic that wait you could set up yourself and get the apps you want but one more thing
there's no lag buffering skipping nothing it runs great but you have to let it load completely up and you might get a little
there's a little bit of lag it's collecting all the information needs and now it's all loaded up pick a board and real quick show you guys
ready go just to give you an idea of the kind of performance you can expect out in this tablet for gaming so there you have it in conclusion
if you were looking into getting this this might as well you know suede you one direction or the other but hopefully
so if you're a fan of that style you're probably going to like this device dual-core 1.5 gigahertz X and O's 4 processor inside with 1.5 gigs of ram
this device is running for point-to-point to jelly bean and it should be noted that there is no NFC on this device
I mean as I said it looks a lot like the galaxy s4 just like a bigger version of it obviously it has the plastic design but thankfully and
you have a little bit of the kind of faux chrome out linings on the sides as well as the salary is around the camera
Samsung has clung hard to the menu button even though Google has pretty much said with Android I think it was jelly bean
oh maybe twenty or thirty bucks more than the galaxy tab 3 8.0 the Nexus 7 is better SPECT in some ways
having said all that it's not that this tablet is necessarily bad in any real way but it's also not really great in any real way either
there are much better options out there in this 8 7 to 8-inch form factor for tablets at possibly a lesser price than the samsung galaxy
i'm jason howell and you can check out all of my reviews on all about android a twit TV / AAA
you've also got this protective case you can put the keyboard on and then and then you pop your tablet in here and then you've gone
it's got child safe browsing so when they are actually online this tablet actually filters out over 32 billion web pages and that is a lot
yes you've got instant tennis like really funky it's great and easy-to-use it's got a nice big screen all the games really fun
you know to do homework schoolwork things like that or you know just having fun the tablet you know on its own
I think it's a win-win I think everybody's happy there hope you enjoyed this video for more help and information go to Kiera worldcom and internet matters dot org
this is an offering from hp that not many people know about but it's it's a direct competitor to the microsoft surface and surface pro line
it's probably right up there with um with an apple with an apple apple trackpad quality i would say and the keyboard itself
um as you can see there it's metal and it's um it's cool to the touch as well so it's an illuminated keyboard
um which probably doesn't show in the video but it's actually um actually quite uh quite good and it's quite a um quite a bright display as well
it's a um it's still um still as bright certainly as bright as a standard laptop but i would say not as bright as some of the newer laptops
that are out at the moment as well but certainly certainly more than enough and you can actually choose a brighter version of this tablet
um it's it's quite a thin quite a thin tablet and when you see it looking up on the standing up on the desk like this
um it's got a nice looking hinge at the back as well so one of the reasons why i decided to make this video
more like an unpopular tablet that normally people know about because it's from hp's elite lineup which is mainly um mainly exclusive to business users
because it gives more like a solid laptop feeling um however you can also pop it up like this and attach it like that
it doesn't so i expect it's doing a fair bit of thermal thermal threatening throttling there as well um but overall it's um it's been quite a good device
wasn't offering lte or 4g um so i've got a 4g sim card like a spare sim card that i wanted to put in here
time when i'm uh using it for work purposes so if i may film my word or excel or um browsing the internet
probably nothing nothing to um nothing to ride home about um but i i do like the um i must say i
and this latest version right here comes with three gigabyte of ram which means faster speed for videos and games as well initially when i first got this tablet
you have a usbc charging cable along with a usbc charging block and here it is guys the dragon touch max 10 tablet now
hd display screen that supports up to 1200 by 1920 full hd display and it supports both 2.4 and 5g wi-fi and it uses usb-c port
i will leave a link to it in the description box down below so you can check it out for yourself
this is where your volume up and down and your power button is located right next to the power button you also have a 3.5 millimeter jack
you can actually just put your finger in there and remove this and this is where you insert your sd card in there on the top
so if you can see right here if you select eye comfort this is kind of like a true tone color displayed on you know ios devices
doesn't you know irritate or ignore your eyes when you are especially reading and you know using this long term and another thing i really like about this model
so let's go ahead and wait till this ad runs over skip ad what's going on and volume is on full as you can see works there
it has two waterslides one on right and another on the left water guns for the kids to enjoy and all right so as you can see there
i think it's a definitely going to be a very good gift if you were to give this to somebody so again
this tablet got two cameras one on the back and one on the front so let me go ahead and show you what they look like
of course front camera does not look as good as the back camera but you can use it for some selfie
all right as you can see there guys and let me see show you let me show you my own camera so as you can see there
something in there if you happen to ever experience an issue whatsoever that way you can reset the entire tablet other than that guys
it has up to 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity resolution of 5k lines per inch and about 220 response rate with 10
i'm not too sure whether you can repurchase just the receiver if you lost it next the battery free pen stylus
alright two programmable buttons and a nice rubber on the grip area and logo printed at the back and lastly the ring nip remover
let's try to remove and see if it is easy to remove just clip it with the hole there and pull it
of course you need to plug the wireless receiver to your pc and try to turn on the button by clicking here
you need to search xp pen website from google and go into the main page and chooses support and driver and choose our graphic tablet model
it seems good and now i will just do some quick test sketch of a simple environment so far so good
i'm using the autodesk sketchbook to test and i'm using a portrait vertical layout canvas and also rotating my graphic table at vertical 2 and the xp pen logo
it's at the bottom when you plug in the cables it asks you to allow permission and need to turn on the otg function before
oh my god what did i just saw it has the pressure sensitivity detection even though we are drawing on android that is unbelievable there are thickness variation
and you can't even draw a simple circle and i can even write words like how i usually connect it to a pc
such an affordable budget tablet has a tail function and it is the only tablet that i think it works best on android devices
I've got to really make sure that I'm looking at this tablet taking in mind the price I think the prize on this tablet is crucial in terms of
and you know it's just you know if you're gonna buy this one for the cameras please don't because you're gonna be really disappointed
it's I think it's kind of like a BGA kind of camera really grainy and if you in the bright light you probably can do a video call
I guess it's fine and also this one I bought for my youngest child so it's always on the floor and she's always banging it about so
yeah it's great that comes with the cases or the cases are great to see inside the box especially for the price you pay
put it in so that you your doors or your son's can watch it on the device through the micro SD card
I end up doing on this one and I think it is great to see that you get a micro SD card on it
Irina put a lot but nevertheless it's good to see you get the option on this one for less than 50 pounds so I really can't complain
are you want top with the resolution of for AP with this tablet so then again it's not a great resolution
maybe a gorilla glass in the front but obviously these things are going to increase the the price on the tablet quite significantly
I hope you enjoy my review if you did believe please leave me a like subscribe my channel and I'll see you by the next one
we said that we have a micro hd slot up to 32 gb here goes the camera here and the speaker very fine
we have we have 1gb of ram and a couple of apps are running right now so it will it's taking 7 or 715 mb and 293 mbr free
the company providing it says it has 12 motion sensors as per the box specification says and we are testing here
just don't work in this app so might be a company saying something kind of virtualized sensors or what only the accelerometer is working
we have camcorder at 640 by 480 at 15 frames per second although the device looks fair and the build quality is good but the display quality is some
this specifically is a verizon exclusive tablet made by asus it has some decent specs as far as the actual hardware inside but the main benefit here
you'll be able to see them very reflected as you can see on the left side we have the SIM tray / SD card holder
this limit does come pre-installed for Verizon so you don't have to worry about that but if you want to add an additional SD card use
DTS tune as well as USB type-c capable of charging a quick charge 3.0 as well as transferring data to your PC
it's a 2k display capable of running many many things the processor that we have running here is the snapdragon 650 now
we have three gigs of internal as far as gigs of ram first four system processes as well as 32 gigs of internal storage that is expandable by that
this is fifty four point twenty eight in fact fifteen up so super fast very very nice and even in my office here where
I'm going to use YouTube on the right so we'll go ahead and use YouTube on the side and then you can actually interface with it
I want to be able to basically just use one I can use it here all the functionalities and things that you expect out of Android 7.0
they're not super loud but they can definitely give you enough to be able to enjoy your content last but not least
as a back sensor you're able to taking pictures both on front and back sensors not the best unfortunately again this is a tablet
there's a few functional things that I showed you guys at the beginning when we were knocking on the actual display to turn it on and turn it off
you don't have to have it running all the time but it's under the display for tuning storage as I mentioned 32 gigs of internal storage
Alexander's showing double tap to wake double tap to turn off the drawing a W opens up the weather application camera with s 4 shutter
I haven't actually had the charger for the last three days and I've been enjoying a lot of content lock lock screen as I mentioned to you guys
this model has an Intel Atom Bay Trail z3 7 4 d processor Atom sort of gets a bad rap over the years
and if you wanted to you could plug in an external keyboard and mouse and display and use this like a desktop computer
and it's really got the umph to run some desktop style applications but in terms of size it really sort of works best
there's one more button up here which is a Windows button and you press that to bring up the Start screen sort of like the windows on a keyboard
so that's actually how you charge it using just a basically a standard USB style adapter USB to microUSB so it's very small very portable
if you use third-party adapters and that also means that if you do have external devices plugged into the USB port
you can see that overall things are pretty responsive and let's go ahead and open up a book now normally on a device this size
which one quirk about it is that once you get it in the case it can be very difficult to get it out
it's not quite as sturdy necessarily as having a you know physical keyboard top type thing that you can put on your lap but I have actually used this
it's solid enough to put on your lap if you're reading or watching a video and don't want to hold the device in your hands so overall
now the biggest problem though is that it does a lot of what other devices already do if you have a smartphone and Android tablet and iPad
I can imagine it makes more sense to grab my Nexus 7 tablet or my samsung ultra book so while I think that this is definitely a decent value
2200 but before this 21.5 inch behemoth with over 8 000 levels of pen pressure and eight customizable buttons joins its brethren on the bottom of my stairwell
there is eight customizable buttons that are easy to set up along with a screen menu that has several preset display options
there's also the issue of windows inc which isn't galman's fault but you have to set it up so that gaomon has admin privileges or this tablet
you probably shouldn't throw it down the stairs though i'm going to give it the arbitrary rating of 3.24 stars out of a smiley face percent
we have a link to where you can download driver this is the USB see data connection cable to connect a tablet to your computer
now this ring here this is not a dowel is actually just for design and it comes in four different colors red gray blue and go
so you don't have to charge it even though it doesn't have a rubber grip it still feels quite comfortable to hold
I'm actually using the tablet so you can see the light indicator here on Mac OS after you install the driver
they use this pressure curve here which is great and these are the two side buttons that you can configure two different mouse clicks keyboard shortcuts some predefined functions
when you're drawing this pen eraser will toggle between pen and eraser depending on the app that you use it may or may not work
this monitor switch is for those people who use dual monitor setup so you when you click this or when you click the physical shortcut button on the tablet
it will switch the cursor from one screen to the other screen and this is the dahle function switch which is not applicable here
I have here this is Photoshop so that Staz quick strokes the strokes they seem to taper quite well and this is quite responsive
the initial activation falls for this tablet is quite low so as long as your pen tip is on the surface you can register online all right
let me move the cursor out of the way so here as well it suddenly drops down and here as well so you can apply even more smoothing
I mean there may be a gap between the line and cursor depending on how good your how powerful your computer is whether this tablet
drop here quite abruptly but for most of the lines that I've just drawn think they performed it look it all right well
Photoshop which sometimes I can feel the lack not because of the tablet but because of the software so here it books really well
Krita this is Krita on Mac OS so pressure works well no issues at all very responsive to in a thick transition
I'm gonna turn this smoothing up to 20% and see if that's going to change anything it improves slightly but I can still see some issues here there
they do crop up not to say that they don't crop up when it comes to drawing when it comes to using this in real life
I have used the quite responsive and it performs really well on Windows except with Photoshop with a slight issue for the line transition but here clip studio
uh this tablet for graphic person or just a present for your friend or for your small child that like to draw
okay guys if you want to know how it's work in the computer just download from huion.com if you don't know how to do it
uh press keys and your a comment that you want they're gonna do so let's see depression sensitivity okay the pressure sensitivity
you have here on the tablet a walk of place that you have the options to increase or decrease it by dragging
so if you've got any issues or anything like that you can email or text these guys and they'll help you with any concerns
it doesn't look like there is one okay so it does come probably it probably does come with a SIM card slot as well
what's overall the first impression is really really good and we are running on android 9 and let's have a look ok security update November 2019
it isn't overly old but obviously something a bit more up to date would be nice and then when it comes to guest use
not that you're gonna use the camera a lot and but it is there if you'd like to then what else we've got in here
but if you'd like to can expand it with a memory card up to 128 gigs and so that's nice though
okay so the device itself does also have two gigabytes of RAM and it does support some sort of a quad-core CPU
NFC on a tablet anyway and then obviously there is Wi-Fi itself when it comes to the camera I would say it's it's kind of there
so it's actually pretty decent and considering the device itself so yeah overall for the price it's hard to find something with newer
the people over at galman asked me to review one of their drawing tablets and i being me could not resist
this tablet has 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity with a battery free ap 32 pen it also supports tilt support to to supports tilt support
sorry it's it allows tilt support which is great for lots of brushes and 12 express keys with 16 soft keys
obviously but nothing like too bad i can easily hold this in one hand and like slide into a bag or something no problem
the back of the tablet includes four grips so i can place it on my desk without worrying about it sliding around
nib stuck in the pen which is always annoying to deal with next thing out of the box is a plastic bag
of course me being me i dropped it when i tried opening it but after picking it back up it feels very very lightweight which is perfect for me
because you're sticking a whole battery in there but when you get a tab like this you can just easily draw on it
it feels so nice not having anything weighing you down but the buttons on the pen both work great and when i click them they're not very loud overall
so you can connect this tablet to an android device and that's everything in the box onto the installation process moving on to the tablet drivers
i opened eclipsio paint to see if it could draw without pen pressure before installing the driver and it just crashed
i have no idea why i'm assuming it's because with my computer or excited at the driver installed but who knows
it was all good but make sure you start your computer after installing drivers so everything works on to actually drawing with the tablet
the tablet i've been using is a screen tablet but when i draw on it the pen pressure is like nothing like just
when i talked about all my drawing tablets i mentioned a glitch that i thought stemmed from my screen tablet where my entire drawing was just being dragged
because when i tested this tablet it made it all the more clear to me that it was just club studio paint settings thankfully
oh here let me draw when you're just hovering over your pen over the screen thing which made my life so much easier
it's really affordable compared to many drawing tablets in the market and i think it's really great for beginners who want to start digital artwork
as long as you keep some of the things i said in mind you should have a great time drawing with this tablet
because you are probably gonna want to taste this once you've seen me review it unless something goes horribly wrong but that's unlikely
I was sent this lovely kind of tissue wrapped package and a hundred and letter by the lovely susana from sterling chocolate
you might be able to see kind of the difference in the sugar crystals so a piece of fudge for example
a fudge would be kind of squishy it would be chewy and it definitely wouldn't be giving off the kind of granular crumbly sugary texture
they've managed to get sugar really kind of fine so even though it's crumbly it's not kind of dry completely melts in your mouth
I've had tablet that's been cooked kind of darker which is even firmer and harder but it can get to that kind of dry stage at that point
I'm feeling very happy very grateful and very generous so I'm not going to hesitate in giving sterling tablet a solid 5 out of 5 again
I will be back very soon and reviewing some more delicious junk food for you guys but until then see you later you
i'm just making sure it's still on the screen so you guys can see and so let's see it allows you to pick all the different languages english spanish
this and so it wants you to sign in to your uh google mail or google account so we'll have to pause for that again
okay uh let's see so now just take a second to go all the way through and it says your assist with voice match
we have uh our whole collection that we have and so the audio is really good it is kind of equity it
there's no lag parking the place where i weigh and so really impressed with the with the actual uh screen resolution
and if it lags or anything the second once you have to play this way so allow and this is a brand new game
take a picture you'll also be able to listen to the audio and then we'll do a review of the whole package
i just wanted to indicate that before i even uh go into the review and now we'll just go into the review
i don't suspect that a great sound card be you know soldered into the actual um motherboard of the tablet that well because i mean it
so it's not like a pc or a you know gimmick console so again sound for what it is 405 pretty much
you know within a year and a half we've had where it had trouble charging and we've had like you know apple samsung and pretty much
you know fate within like a year and a half two years will start lagging or having you know from inserting the charging cable into the port
i downloaded and that's a brand new game with high graphics you know processing speed and so and there was no lag
then we got this pen case back for our tablet which can stretch well and other things which i'll describe later now i'll show how the tablet looks
so as i told you before i'll describe many things in the box so here we have give thanks that glow and enjoy connection it
my old tablet had no express keys so i got used to draw with left hand and use computer mouse with right hand
now i'll show how the express keys work there are many of them can undo what you drew zoom in and zoom out and move the layer
there are express keys on the pen it would be very useful for much one button as a pen and another as an eraser
you've got some explaining to get through like why you're coming home as some ghastly hours and what's your cover story and this time please don't bore me
it's never too early if the sun is up so pass me the bottle and forget the cup to find out of line
Walmart this is their kind of electronics brand called on onn this comes in at 64 dollars and for the price
I did kind of want to compare the size between the fire HD 8 and this new on tablet because they are using the same chipset
I'm going to test out some video playback some native Android gaming and we'll even get into a little bit of emulation with this Walmart tablet for the CPU
I was talking about but they're kind of out of the way and that's really the only bloat on here this is Android 9.0 video playback spying through Netflix
this could come down to better cooling in the fire 8hd but when we move over to 3dmark sling shot which is very
sorry about the glare here trying to move this thing around over all asphalt rally runs really well on this little fabric
I'm sure you can get better performance out of this if you tweak the settings I just left it stock to see what it could do here
it's not horrible but I do notice some lag here and there I set up some dynamite to see if we could crash this thing the final game
that are gonna run some well optimized ones like Mario 64 but here we have PlayStation one running Tekken three full speed
this is crash bandicoot 2 and finally we have some Nintendo DS emulation using the paid app drastic from the Google Play
Store you're going to be fine emulate EBS on this thing so overall for emulation on the Atari 2600 nes SNES pc engine
HD isn't on sale so the Walmart on 8 inch tablet would be my choice because we have Android and we have a little bit more RAM here
if you have any questions or you want to see anything else tested on the 64 dollar tablet just let me know in the comments below but like always
I hooked it up to my wife's phone and I decided to download a couple art programs on it and give it a go
I was contemplating like animating something but I didn't have that much charge left on my recorder so I thought you know what screw it
that's one of the hardest things you've got to get used to when using one of these tablets because we're screen tablets
I don't know if the video is going too fast but sometimes when my arm reaches over to hit the keyboard I accidentally graze the touch bar
CC never change alrighty then on to the ratings for the hearing on HS 611 so the build quality for the custom for what it is
you've got no color calibration or screen accuracy or whatever it just it's just plug and play pretty much so really
really if you think about it you get a lot for such a low price of $64.99 a time of recording
so one of young team members reached out to me by email and asked if i wanted to review one of their tablets
you can also check everything on the website and decide what you want or don't want um so without further ado let's get started and see how it goes
it's in the form of a disc makes me remember the old times when we used to actually have disks to download drivers and here
there you guys and as you can see now it has this anti-glare surface so you're not able to see the reflection anymore
and i think that's fantastic of course because while you're drawing you don't want to be seeing your surroundings you want to just focus on your artwork
and we're gonna get to that then you have your on and off button and all in all it is very very cool i like it
you have your four rubber things here so it doesn't move around while you draw two usbc ports so then the other thing that i got that is extra
because this is not a pro series but i am super pleasantly surprised and i definitely think that it is worth the fee that they are asking for it
another thing they point out on their website is that you can use it as a pen display tablet or a pen top
if you're a professional artist then you most probably wouldn't go with this model but as a beginner or intermediate artist i feel like that's a fantastic start
and maybe i'll get the chance to review more in the future so stay tuned and now see you next time bye you
I’d rather have a scroll wheel, which is like getting 4 extra shortcut buttons, than marginally better color. The color on the 15.6
So let me walk you through how to set this tablet up along with its physical features and then I’ll get to the review part.
The other side of the capsule has 8 extra pen tips for replacement when the one in the pen wears down.
It has 2 shortcut buttons and is almost exactly the same as its Wacom counterpart, shown here, except the XP-Pen has no eraser bottom.
As you can see, the tablet itself has 8 shortcut buttons and a scroll wheel that allows up to 5 different functions.
To plug your tablet in, take the big cable, get the long end with the small oval-shaped mouth and plug it into the side of the tablet.
Next, plug the red USB end into the USB extension cord because you will probably need it. Then plug the power block to the end of that.
If at this point, or at any point in the future you notice things are displaying strange on your tablet, or the pen is being weird, right
This window needs to be on the tablet and you have to press inside of it to see the blue pressure test bar appear.
You can literally have the pen on the screen and draw a line and it won’t show up if your touch is light enough.
Of course this also means when trying to click things with the pen, sometimes my pathetic tap was not enough to activate.
Here you see the tilt function letting me change the direction of the brush by tilting the pen in different directions.
I will have a general help video about how to decide which tablet to get coming out some time this year.
Bosto got in touch with me to see if i'd like to review their 15.6 inch digital drawing tablet and seeing as last year
Wacom huion and XP pen really dug into this versatile size range of tablets designed to sit at your computer and also fit into your bag
Bosto logo and barcodes along the side and then a plethora of visual information on what this tablet can do on the back
it's always nice to see a tablet come in more than just a warehouse box and take an interest in presentation
this cover is in fact a card sleeve with a further white tablet box inside that contains all the product specifications on the back
a plastic seal is for tablet stylus itself which we'll take a look at in a moment and below that sitting in a vacuum formed
when on the move the opposite card box then houses for rest of the peripherals you get a baggie containing four spare nibs as well as a cheeky pasto
Mac or PC while the other ends smaller HDMI and USB C plug firmly into the deeply recessed ports along tablets
the screen itself is powered directly through that USB connection so Venice just a case of peeling off the screen protector
HD creative stylus tablet looks like when you've got it in a fairly spacious desk setup like mine compared to my main 27-inch monitor or so side note
it feels very much like a slightly firmer wheel action that you might find in the middle of your mouse and those buttons along
but that's still slightly better than having come away from your tablet completely in order to press keys on your keyboard
you do have four more larger buttons which are for the tablet screen settings allowing you to adjust your brightness contrast and screen color temperatures and
it's built up by having two different folding metal brackets but raised up to link into one of three different slot options
compared to some higher-end 8k level pens but to the nib itself sits very firmly in place with no spongy movement
now ideally you want to find that sweet spot where you get a minimum amount of movement so that the pressure of your brushstrokes translates into a change
and it did give out enough power to run the screen for video games which is good to know if you're packing a bag for a holiday
but as this tablet has no audio out or speakers you will need to plug your headphones directly into the switch now
I personally turned their first unused pen button over to the eraser ever so slightly increased for sensitivity of the pen strokes and then customized v8 quick access keys
now this as well as being a pen display tablet is also a touchscreen and you can use your fingers to navigate the on screen functions
much like you would expect with an Android tablet the gesture support worked straightaway in Photoshop to allow zooming and rotating by hand and in the driver menu
Bosto were in the middle of improving the driver software and touch sensitivity and I was actually working with a pre-release version
just not quite with the same finesse or responsiveness but I've otherwise enjoyed in some competitors pens and as mentioned underneath the removable screen protector
I'd say that you might want a more responsive screen to pen experience than this box of that being said for what it is
this is a great box set to get somebody into some digital art especially coming from a much less widely recognized tablet brand
I like to thank teclast for being kind enough to send the tablet out to me to review here on the channel
you can see with the teclast logo right there but other than that not too much getting deeper into the box
the actual resolution is 1920 by 1200 so actually a little bit better than 1080p even and we're getting a PPI of 214 now
I would say that for the price of the tablet it is certainly bright enough and I really like how crisp and clear everything looks on the display itself
so you can use the tablet either in portrait mode or you can use it in a landscape format like this
obviously if you're watching movies you probably want to tilt it in the landscape but I like how clean and simple
there's really no comparison and of course it's really nice to that you are getting four gigs of RAM which is pretty impressive as well
we'll talk about the speaker's out in a second when I play some video content but like I said the cameras get the job done
I mean you're gonna be saving hundreds of dollars so there are bound to be some compromises but you can see here that everything is totally fine
since the display is so large you can pull up articles and see all kinds of text here and everything looks super crisp and clear and great-looking
hopefully this helped you decide whether or not this tablet is a good fit for you but I think you'll be
but it's all right because instead you get a bag okay that now you've gone over the stuff you get in the box
the next thing i was trying to do was to set up the express keys and not going to lie even for my big brain power
i will draw connecting it to my tablet because it's easier to record that way and computer version of medibang still scares me now the straw and here
that's that's what i mean but other than that i think it it felt nice like i i like how the pressure sensitivity feels like
and there's no changing so you deal with it now that's just one of a couple of little housekeeping things on
I'll link it on the screen and in the description go use it at the official Huey on shop or Amazon shops
I should mention however though that the recent version the recent iteration of this device has tilt enabled and that's only available on the official Huey on store
seven by five point four inches 8,192 levels of pressure sensitivity and a battery free stylus beyond that there are eight customisable
in particular to this device there is the functionality of tilt added meaning it detects if the pen is doing that or in what direction
if you have any doubt just google the name of the product that you get from huion you end up on the shop page
you go to the download section on that page and there's a link to you drive a download so you download it
on once setup it really was a matter of like 1 to 2 minutes tops to get set up using this thing was really great
but you're drawing sort of out of your line of sight because you're watching the cursor move around there's base like a mouse but it's a pet now
and I don't know why maybe I drank the luck potion from Harry Potter feel it Felix Felicis Felice phalluses Felicis Khaleesi
where in particular if you use a smudge guard but even without it's a really comfortable drawing experience and in the first 10 minutes
I was able to start like feeling confident enough to be like maybe old try calligraphy and I wrote a calligrapher
so let's move on from first impressions there and talk a little bit about more of the finer points of views
you're either drawing with a sort of finer details and in smaller areas on the tablet and screen therefore drawing with your wrist or
you're moving your arm a little bit more entering sort of over the overall work area of the tablet the reason
all of a sudden third huion interface was new and shiny and different a way this brings me to my next point tilt functionality and in a way
Photoshop brushes especially the ones with tilt and rotation enabled was phenomenal and I felt like the entire responsiveness of the experience was a lot better
devices is to set one of the mouse clicks on the pen to be a left click and then of course touching the screen is a left click
it's there so having gotten all the chords out of the way and just been as brutal as I possibly could with anything I could find
I want to now get to the pros because there are quite a few pros more than I expected there would be
in that regard the use of the device handles like a dream and it has become a loud and clear number one recommendation as a start
because it's its own device and has its own battery life needing both to be carry-ons made the flying experience a little cumbersome to say the least so
if this gets crazy how portable this thing is like this thing is and how much utility it provides even for a professional so while
being a beginner device it's also a fantastic secondary utility device for people who need a little extra utility on the go
I think that's why I'm so blown away because I'm like I I needed this thing and I didn't realize it which brings me to my final verdict
USD that's without the discount so the Huron house 950 P gets an absolute - thumbs up from me and I can highly recommend it
I have loads of different challenges and different art project and of course I have a whole bunch of different unboxings and reviews of programs and products
make sure to subscribe to my channel to see more of my videos and while you're at it check out my shop where
especially if you will hold the device in your hands for long viewing sessions overall the build of the Alcatel III 10 feels somewhat cheap
Alcatel a310 has a 10.1 inch display with a 1280 by 800 pixel resolution giving it a pixel density of 140 9.45
the transition between the light and dark scenes of the corridors who are noticeable even though the display is reflective however
you also have the option to customize these shortcuts when it comes to real world performance the tablet can be described as average at best starting with the touchscreen
I have long fingers if you will use this device to type a lot of documents I would recommend a Bluetooth keyboard
you can let us know what you thought of this video in the comment section below and for more videos like this one you can subscribe to our channel
you can go up to one terabyte anyway but if you want to post pop in your SD card you can do that too now
of course you do have another speaker grille as we pan up but you can see the volume rocker and the 3.5 headphone jacks right there again
and it's got the all the features you expect from the thing pad keyboard as mentioned you can actually lean this down if you want to see
and this is something a lot of people like so if you have any questions or any comments let us know otherwise
And there are so many choices to choose from now. There's so many tablets, because digital art and the internet is blossoming.
Just an FYI, this isn't a mobile computer, this is a tablet screen where you can connect it to your computer.
And that's one thing I really admire about iMac's or Wacom products, is they really take a lot of integrity and detail in how the colors are perceived.
Ah! My bad, well, we just lost one, but the cool thing is, we have like three more. So, we're just gonna slide it out, like that.
This is about an hour, an hour and a half of painting. We got the colors down, the composition, but I feel like it's missing something.
I know some of you are seeing if this one is the right one for you or looking to purchase your very first Cintiq.
And I know that there are so many options to choose from, and.. pro 32, there's a 24, 16, 13, the 22
HD, I have the 27, and there's probably a few more. But this one was built for the sole purpose of being an affordable entry to the Cintiq line.
Let me know in the comments below and we'll choose a very very very lucky subscriber to give this Cintiq to.
And if you get one of these Cintiq's, I hope you enjoy it as much as me and Milo do. Right buddy?
I haven't used tablets in four years and I hope you will enjoy this because there are lots of tablets coming
oh also the background noise will be kind of noisy because my babies are awake at this time and their corners
so we got a tablet it has 12 what what are these cool drove this button things and 60 and 60 functional cheese
just listen to me and I'll tell you that it really works and there's no lag that's the main point inside the box you see
of course you go online and you can't download the driver so basically it uses a driver that is you have to download it yourself
they look almost identical definitely but like this the length and such like that but the old version looks more cheap with the plastic and silvery
what I like about it is that they come with a little pulse right here which is well at a glance
oh this is whatever button but then if you are on the top section okay you should be able to feel that
of course not the smallest one right here the six by four okay but the size of the huge difference already
okay so yeah and now let me just grab that cable and I just see this is the cable that come of the tablet
so it's really really okay so now let me just plug this into the computer and also the oh one more thing
the driver is basically the same thing as the a 30 and the same thing as this s 650 does s 640 home
I also have my fill pocket beside the beside my a fill pocket is beside the pen tool which is very handy for joining cartoon
I can undo and redo like that okay so and then the top two button is for increase and decrease brush size okay
it's very handy of the touch panel right here but you can't you find in the tablet that is double the price price
okay so it's really good feature and also there's like absolutely no delay whatsoever when you're trying to draw so yeah this the real drawing point
I don't need to spare any like huge amount of space on my desk to have but this one really speedy when I'm doing art so I like that
hello everyone my name is s comic maker and in today's video we're going to be taking a look at the gaomon pd 1161 pen display tablet
recently the lovely people over at gaomon reached out to me and asked if i would review their gaomon pd 1161 pen display tablet
if you need it to start off inside the box you get all the things you need to set yourself up once you peel off the protective plastic
that gives the tablet more of a paper feel that felt really nice while sketching inside the box we get an instructional manual
i just plugged the cables into the tablet connected them to a power source as well as my computer and we were rolling and the setup was really nice
or if you're used to working on one of the smaller ipads it'll feel pretty similar although i will say that
website provided in my little instruction booklet selected the tablet that i had in the options and downloaded the driver that fit with my computer
the display tablet that i normally work with has a stand built in so having this lay flat on my desk
but i already went ahead and calibrated it before i saw it so you might need to reset that if you did
this tablet out by drawing an original character of one of my wonderful patrons sketching felt pretty good and very smooth
just sometimes when i tried to click on things in the corners i would notice that the cursor would be off a little bit
it felt very minor though and like i said when i was drawing in the middle of it i didn't really have any issues i also really enjoyed
how many hotkeys there were for a tablet this size and i also liked that there were even keys on the pen itself
when you held down the middle of the button for me when it comes to things like this i can usually work around or deal with little minor inconveniences
as long as i'm able to get the final result that i want so the little minor things in this tablet didn't bother me at all
the colors aren't exact and sometimes it felt a little cramped if i had started on this tablet instead of the one i used currently
you just have this little hole in the bottom and you put the pen in there and tilt it sideways and you can pull that sucker right out
thank you as always to my amazing patrons and to people like you who like comment on and share my videos
oh you make the art on this tablet and then you sing about the tablet and then you wonder why you're singing cause nobody's listening
There's so many great tablets out there and you guys have been wanting to see another tablet review from me, so I've connected with the people at XP-Pen.
On your laptop, it can be the full resolution. And then on this tablet, it can be its full native resolution which is 1920 x 1080.
Because my tablet's a few years old and since this is a newer tablet, it has a much higher range of sensitivity.
I think my biggest critique about this tablet is maybe it requires a little too many wires to get it to operate
Rule number two is to answer the question of the video, which is, if you could live in any world, what would that world look like?
But let me know in the comments below, and we'll choose a lucky subscriber to win one of these Artist 12 tablets.
so it's probably worth the wait but if you have had any experience with them then put a comment in the description for others to look at
I'm reviewing this from a 3d artists perspective and a digital artists perspective and I'll be comparing it to the wet home and the heel yawns now
get two pens and two charges the little dock that you put the pen on you can actually put up right
what annoyed me though is that you can't change the driver folder so it has to install on your C Drive and that I find frustrating
one thing a lot of people complain about the lead plug-in at the bottom so they kind of bend over when you are changing the height of the stand
so your cursor is a distance away from your pen when you touch the screen now because you're looking at it straight on
I couldn't get into work so I had to send it back but that may just be my system and it may be Windows updates
Windows seemed to do a lot of things with touchscreens so I think that's where the difficulties lie the digital art
inches and the resolution is 2k with 16 by 10 of expect ratio the combination of 10 inch screens and 2k resolution produce density of 219 and PPI
absolutely no complaints quite sharp with vivid color the Xperia z4 tablet uses an 8 megapixel rear camera and 5 megapixel front camera
let me start this full review by showing you the things included in the box by the way the tablet that i have
a and this is l-shaped micro usb and we have this soft carrying case for the tablet and artist glove quick start guide and manual pen case
so it's just this pen case the pen it's battery free so you don't have to charge it and it's quite comfortable to hold build
and this two usb adapters for usbc and micro usb so these are for you to connect the tablet to your android devices the size of this tablet
and this is not a wireless tablet so you have to use the usb cable provided and it goes here the cable will point upwards
this is considered a medium sized tablet and this size is suitable for use with monitors and laptops of any sizes
if there are any issues with pressure sensitivity driver installation on windows is straightforward driver installation on mac os 10.14 10.15 or the newer mac os
let's see what you can do with the driver so here you can adjust the pressure sensitivity for the pen using this slider
though the two side buttons on the pen can be customized here so you can assign keyboard shortcuts or various mouse clicks to the two buttons
oops so you see this transition from a thin to thick it's very smooth and when the line turns the turns are very smooth as well
midi bank paint pro affinity photo affinity designer adobe illustrator creator clip studio paint and all those apps they performed really well
however i wouldn't recommend getting this tablet solely for the purpose of using with android devices because the performance can be unpredictable
and when you have the tablet like this this area here this is mapped to the vertical area of the phone
Wacom Intuos Pro which comes with the new sensitive akin propane to and in this video I will share what I thought about it with you
I have been using vacant tablets and screens for a very long time and my previous into's lasted for exactly ten years
it still works perfectly but obviously the technology improved a lot since then and this latest version beats it in many aspects for this test
of course you can avoid getting a converter if you are just using the tablet wirelessly and you charge your tablet with a USB adapter somewhere else
the stylus has the usual two customizable buttons on it and the pen itself really feels great to hold and drove it
the pen stem design is also really neat and elegant and the coolest feature of it is the nib remover hole at the bottom
intuos pro tablet which allows you to sketch on paper on top of the tablet and refine your work digitally later on personally
I am pretty used to the hand-eye coordination and I actually like the fact that my hand is not obstructing the view of what
I can highly recommend it to anyone who can invest a bit more into their accessories and who doesn't mind the unique hand-eye coordination
I can recommend the Veii come into US which is significantly cheaper but still provides great control and smooth drawing experience let us know in the comments section
thanks a lot for watching like and share this video if you enjoyed it have fun learning guys and I will see you in the next one you
Hi, this is David from geekanoids.co.uk and after this short break I'm going to be bringing you a review of the Wacom intuos four graphics tablet
that's roughly, this is an a4 sheet of paper roughly half of an a4 sheet so a good area [for] actually working on your artwork
So if you're using for example the fiber tip pen then it will sense that and give you a different experience
when you're using the the pen on the tablet, so really really well-thought-out, and and again well done wacom for taking things
it's a convertible notebook which means that is extremely versatile and you can use it on the go or in the office
this will great for designers or any kind of creative user as you can get lots of software that works amazing with this pen
USB port a docking connector and the headphone jack and at the back it has an Ethernet port and a VGA port
this is also where you found the stylus pen on the side of the tablet is the smart card reader for business users
and on the top it has a fingerprint reader or to rotate on an off switch volume and the power button
I definitely recommend this as a business convertible be sure to subscribe if you enjoyed and check out our social media
the display is probably the best feature of it 1900 by 1200 to a full 1080p resolution on this essentially and it's also an IPS display
so you get very good viewing angles and really nice detailed sharp images on screen so they did a very nice job with display on this
this is a very common processor on these types of devices and when we go through our performance benchmarks in a little bit
write speed to try to get as much performance as you can especially if you plan to load some applications up onto that card on the other side here
HDMI out you can connect an external display up to it which I did earlier today and that worked just fine and just like any other
I did try one of those Y connectors you can get that allow power to pass through in addition to a USB device
and it's got two mics here on the top of the case so overall very nicely built doesn't weigh all that much either 0.6 pounds or 272 grams
it takes horrible pictures as you can see here and the video on it even though it does 1080p at 30 frames per second is equally bad
I've got my youtube channel here playing a 1080p video at 60 frames per second and all looks like it is performing as expected here
also all things considered this is a very good video playback device and I think will do equally well with Netflix and other services
web browsing on the device feels a little sluggish to me from time to time and I think it might be the wi-fi's fault
Wi-Fi technology going on here and that works just fine as its doing right now and other times it runs rather slowly
so there's just something going on here with the Wi-Fi at least in my particular setup that is slowing this down slightly I did run the browser
I'm running minecraft now to get a feel for its gaming prowess this is the Java version of Minecraft which most people are still running
you may want to check system requirements first but you can have a somewhat decent playable gaming experience on here if you set your graphical expectations accordingly
that went squared right within the margin of error as this one did and we also saw a very similar scores on the Vita
H EDC stuff so for example this 60 megabit HEV C file does not perform so well about some lower end
don't have the same kind of support that this one will probably be coming with and the fact that it's being sold in
Microsoft stores gives me some confidence maybe some comfort at least that somebody is going to stand behind the product here
I do recommend though as I mentioned before getting a decently fast SD card to put in here some of those ultra or extreme cards from SanDisk
I have used Huion for many years now and these latest gen tablets are the proof of how far they have come in terms of quality
if you are a professional or a hobbyist artist by the end of this review you would know why and how this tablet is good for both of you.
the other side of the pen holder has a hole which can help you pull out the nib and put a new one.
the cable which powers the tablet is the USB see at one end and standard USB on the other which goes inside your computer laptop tablet
stop knowing but I have another huge on product with me which is totally wireless and that review is coming up soon so do subscribe for it
you get a warranty card and other papers inside the box - my first feel impression of the tablet was it was being very light
at least to me that feel of the tablet was nothing less than anything which could be said or felt as budget or cheap
the surface isn't extremely paper lag but feels really good - there are 4 + 2 + 4 buttons which are easily customizable by default
active area of the tablet is element by 6 point 8 inches which is quite good as the same size tablets from
there are 4 rubber grips on the bottom so that the tablet doesn't slip or anything and a very rough texture on the bottom of the tablet
I knew it from the beginning ok the Express keys have little dots on them and a really distinctive outer boundary pressing
and if you don't like it customize it that's why it's called programmable these days it's actually my wife who uses pen tablets more than me
no not a kidney but my point is that there is hardly any technological difference left when compared against the king which is vacuum and on top of that
I personally stopped looking at wacom offerings for almost half a decade because half a decade sounds way more than five years
I know that you know that I am talking about smart phones so simply connect the tablet and run any app you want in my case
and while you are doing this you are only able to use half of the active screen on the pen tablet and that too only in portrait mode
it was kind of hard to find the pointer always when the bridge size was small depending on the kind of app
hey guys Nathan here with the e-book reader calm for this video I'm going to give you guys a review as a fire HD 8
it's got the 8 inch screen like our saying there's a 1280 by 800 screen does look pretty good the main complaint
it's got kind of a little bit of a cheap plastic back but you've got to also got the cameras the front rear cameras
it's a little bit awkward on these especially if you're moving to the rose but you can create different folders like
it has really low brightness so that it's nice and easy to read at night but the brightness is also not very bright
you can find a video for that piece of cake and get Google Apps on here you also got of course
but there's nothing like the Google Play Store so it also helps to have like a file manager like Astro install because that basic one they have
you can look up how to use this feature and now the different things work so let's go ahead and talk about the ebooks features right now
they have some more like advanced features and like the Kindle e-readers do you got some like they have the text-to-speech features we have the audiobook integration
so it's got some different features up here in the menu on the tablet so you got like the word want runner you've got notebook and flashcards
c'mon but just the way it works basically is they'll just show you this one word on the screen at a time you can control the speed
PPI which is alright but I mean I kind of like high resolution stuff also like the 300 PPI screen of the Kindle
it just looks quite a bit better so you got the blue shade feature on here as well so like for night reading
you can kind of filter out the blue light if you want to use that so yeah not a whole lot else on here
there's also the huge size which is quite frankly as it says huge but yeah so you got those different font sizes on here
so some different on fire tablets you can have them encrypted for more security so a couple of the other accessibility options in here
it has this rubber all around to protect during shipping so you also have some booklets some instruction manual warranty card
guys this tablet has 4g and you can make calls with it okay so moving on to the main start of the show teclast p20 hd
there's a few air bubbles there front camera there at the front completely black when you look at it on the back like i mentioned
you guys can see the eight cores at the moment tablet is idling and you can see the speed at the moment on the display tab
yeah is the resolution 1920 by 1200 so slightly taller than a 1080p 10.05 inch and the pixel density 225 dpi
normally it's quite tricky to get it right on camera and moving on we have the network where we can see
and you can see the full capacity 6 000 milliamps an hour android tab we can see is running android 10 and the device is not rooted so guys
this must be level three and as you guys can see on the resolution there the max resolution supported is 960 by 540 so not full hd on netflix
let's bring the brightness all the way to the max let's now play a few games guys starting with asphalt 9.
it's not too bad guys not too bad at all there you go and that's how we play pubg moba in terms of sound
yeah let's change it back to um the front camera and now we're using the front camera 480p only so it is what it is guys
ui for example this smart saving mode for the battery you can find three predefined settings smart power and ultra saving mode
is this color settings here so you can change straight away the colors to cool or warm and also you have the increased contrast down there
like always guys thank you very much for watching and hope i can see you all in the next one oh you
so if you've got a small desk then maybe a small ones view but if you can then go for the bigger size
it's also got a touchpad so you can sort of push it left and right and up and down and they operate different controls
it's 40 pounds so it's a bit cheaper than the huion and the UG and it's just a tad bit more expensive than the age 30
I'm not noticing much difference between these graphics tablets and the Wacom tablet so I think they're pretty much in the same ballpark now
I didn't see it available anywhere except gearbest so I'll be putting the links in description for that they will be affiliated link
if you click on them you can always go straight to the gearbest site and in the 8th if you wanted
there's quite a nice little feature that you've got these little lines that are indented here on the buttons that are closer to the trackpad
I have to uninstall the rest of my drivers and install this one but I suppose that's not going to be a problem for anybody else
I was leaning towards the XP pen which I use a lot of work but actually I'm slightly preferring this one
we'll take a look at why i think this for the money that is is the best budget android 10 tablet
it's one of the cons so it will take about three hours almost to fully charge the 6 000 milliamp hour battery
and there's the sim tray right up here so this will actually take two sims or a nano sim and micro sd card support
it's also got lte band 20 and band 28 that we often miss with the chinese tablets but this uni sock the chip in this one
but there's no you know tick tock or facebook or anything like that which is good so we don't have a widevine level
so this is connected up to wireless in here five gigahertz band and i'm able to push average top speeds of about 350 megabits per second downstairs
i'm still getting a reasonable kind of speed here and about three bars of signal strength which isn't too bad now
but it's still good that it's there now when you are watching youtube content which is 16x9 or any content that is 16x9
it's a matter of seconds and it's running fine so this is running better than i imagined it would with this particular chipset now so we do
but here's a sample of them at 100 volume so this pdf reader here that i'm using with my test file
better than i thought it would because especially considering that antutu score and then portrait for ebooks for example here you can see
so i wouldn't get this tablet if you expect to have super smooth nice fps the whole time gaming because you will be disappointed with this one
10 dual sim support with lte band 2028 and it even has gps although well the gps is not very good
this is not really for people into demanding games especially those well fps ones like say pubg and call of duty that i tested
it really is a good tablet and a pleasant surprise and great to see and i'm able to cover a tablet like this
that's why i've been avoiding a lot of the real cheap tablets until now so i'll be back with another tablet review coming up in the channel
that'll be probably in about a week's time so i hope to catch you back then and thank you so much for watching this in-depth review
i made a video all about how to shop for a digital drawing tablet and at the time i had said that i never used a hun product before
because i hadn't and i still haven't but that changes today huan was nice enough to send me this tablet the inspiro ink model h32m
i was concerned about a mark on the back of the screen but i discovered that when you hit the little eraser button all the marks disappear
which is pretty thoughtful if you want to include because nothing is worse than opening up a new toy and not being able to use it right away
you can't do that with yuan all right so we are four minutes into this video and finally gonna make some art
let's go so since this tablet is so thin and lightweight and it comes with a little sleeve and it works on android devices
another thing i was concerned about is the fact that this silas doesn't have an eraser i'm so used to wacom
so it's really not that big of a deal and it's especially not worth the price jump just to have an eraser
did i have any issues with my settings or have to reset the driver which i cannot say about other tablet brands
these are my own opinions and i'd like to think that i'm not someone who's going to be swayed by free stuff
i've been really excited to use a drawing tablet with my phone ever since i found out that some tablets are compatible with android devices
and i'm also going to be reviewing the huan screbo pw310 which is a stylus slash pen like an ink pen with like real ink
i don't even know how that works but i'm excited to find out so stay tuned for both of those videos soon hit the bell subscribe
you can get it for free or if you want to throw me a few bucks you can name your own price either way
there's just not really a lot out there that's interesting at least the more unknown kind of brands that I took the people review
it's the t30 and what it has now is a much better chipset in here so we don't have any more
Hal EO x 20 series chips finally the Chinese manufacturers are putting in the heli au p series the new P
EU one and this is rated at 5 volts 2.5 amps so it doesn't support their pump express to which the chipset does which is a shame
but it's a hardware one which is good so it's not using bluetooth so the build is rounded edges here metal on the back yes
C port it does not support video out unfortunately that would have been really nice but I guess it would have pushed the price up beyond two hundred
US dollars that it's currently selling for but there is no HDMI on here as well so absolutely no video out which is a real
if you pushed in for example a paper clip there you need to reset it and right here up the top
I noticed that it's definitely a step up from the hey leo X 20 series so the X 27 X 23 tablets
the white balance is absolutely missing but the calibration of the white out of the box is almost neutral white which is good
that were the previous tablets with the mediatek helio X 27 and even just doing that it will be a little choppy a little laggy
T 40 with Android Ted next year and that is that okay so the only updates will be to small bug fixes so a bit of Google bloke
EMM c5 sorry for point 5.1 spec so not amazingly fast but it will not bottleneck the system the bottleneck will be L CPU and the chipset here
the screen is sometimes a touch not responsive and a lot of speeds very good ok but but there is a but sadly
so now on to the audio quality top firing speakers and they sound okay they do have a little hint of bass
I've got one on here and then I can give you a quick sample of and I think it's fine now
it is okay it's not going to be a Snapdragon 855 plus no it's not going to be an iPad pro
no no but it is a huge step up from the previous models in terms of gaming performance used to see
Call of Duty is very very choppy but you can play Call of Duty on the medium sitting and the highest possible framerate option
just swipe up and get to the bottom of the page like you can do with mobile phones and other tablets
but we're getting there with seeing improvements coming through we've got Android 9 but remember this will never get Android 10
Chinese manufacturers it will with other brands but these guys only pump out bug fixes and the other thing that's worth mentioning and then in my experience here
this tablet will get 1 bar or maybe not even get the connection so the range is a little short there on the wireless especially we with 5g 2.4
so now it's all grown up thirteen point three inches so for those who who like the surface pro but find the display a little bit small
Phillips head screws that you unscrew and then you can take off the cover and you can service it so big
so the pen that comes with this supports pen and touch both this is a Wacom a ES digitizer and pens and active pen
it's not really gonna hold the pen in place while this is in your bag so I'll leave it up to you as to whether you would use that
II used to be one point six nine pounds which was about the same as the surface pro in terms of weight
it typically does not get burning hot when doing everyday productivity things even something like Photoshop compiling a little software code
if you're looking for something that can be great for a little art pastime or if you're an avid note-taker our diagram or any of those sorts of things
some people really like that they would love to get a surface but they won't for whatever reason or their company won't buy one
HDR option like you would get with the x1 yoga or the x1 carbon the current generations alas so I guess get this versus the Microsoft Surface pro
well one of the big reasons would be the fact that you can actually take that cover off and service it
even more it feels like a regular keyboard it feels like a ThinkPad keyboard which is to say the typing experience is excellent
yeah you're not gonna get as much key travel because of the skinny sort of design there but Wow nice typing experience
this one has a kind of rugged rubbery back cover that stops it from skating around and well it's easier to clean and maintain same drawback as surface
lets you connect anything you want pretty much and Thunderbolt 3 docks but the lack of a USB a port is annoying within five minutes
I had to whip out a USB C to USB a Donald just to plug in a mouse a flash drive
it's gone it's one of those old doors with a pokey hole you need a paperclip to open and close it
and it's it's a lenovo branded panel so we can't tell you who actually really makes it so it all sounds pretty good
point at all and it's a wonderful typing experience for those you don't like the type cover for the surface pro low travel

so if you want to approach digital arts but you don't have any equipment you can participate to this giveaway and try to win this and to participate
you just have to follow the rules in a description below this video and that's it good luck guys this pen
it's only around 200 euros which is still a lot of money by comparing it to other tablets on the market
then it's important when you're painting digitally if you want to make prints for example just in case you were wondering the screen is not laminated
which means that the glass goes over to display creating the appearance of a gap but pretty much all display tablets out
sometimes she loves what he ends and they stick to the glass of the tablet the surface and this is made to avoid that
you just have to plug in all the cables and remove all the other tablet drivers if you have more than one from your computer because unfortunately this driver
it doesn't work if there are other drivers in your computer you then just need to go to the gamin website
I would love to say that I love this driver but I don't just the fact that I have two units
it's quite annoying because I have more than one tablet and the idea that I have to reign style and unistall the drivers all the time
I mean it's really old and not even a Wacom Cintiq works there so if you have a very old computer this might not work anyway
I haven't used Photoshop to the digital art in ages because of course the program doesn't work on my laptop as well just nothing works
I don't even know how I managed to edit videos on there like it's a miracle all the time I'm just
I only used the standard Photoshop brushes because my sister didn't have any other brushes and I couldn't bother installing new ones so I just use that and guys
it is right away as you can see before even focusing on the shapes and shadows and especially the proportion so
protector got scratched as well and it's not covered by warranty so and it costs 200 years to change to repair
so in my opinion sin ticks are not worth the price you just pay for the brand-name in my opinion anyway that's it for this video guys before
it also has a 13 megapixel rear camera and a 5 megapixel front camera it also has a 000 milliamp hour battery and gps
we have a usb a to usb type c charging cable and here we have our little charging adapter which is 5 volts 2 amps
let's go ahead and take a look at the settings here so right out of the box it came with a 95 battery which is great
swipe left or i'm sorry swipe right to go back very easy kind of like apple as far as the sound goes
so whatever you're gonna get from the sound is just gonna be straight trouble as far as the storage goes right out of the box
i'll go ahead and put it down to 50 and we'll see what it looks like there so since as you can see
uh the lag you saw like i said before i don't think was because of the graphics i think it was probably the connection
there might have been you know too much stuff loading in or what now but right now since i've been playing i haven't seen any lag
quality is set to low when there's nothing we can do about that frame rate is medium so at the lowest setting
mobile graphics aren't going to be the best but still you can still get a get a quick game in if you really need to
recording with the tablet was good placement for my left hand because the camera is kind of centered on the back of the tablet
it is super bright outside right now and then here are some camera samples from the rear camera as you can see the picture
i got about nine hours of screen on time and that it was at fifty percent brightness and again that's perfectly fine for indoor use
it'll get you by in a pinch but i definitely wouldn't want this camera solely for taking pictures of things that i want to remember
if you're going to use this tablet for you know browsing the web listening to music or watching streaming videos anything like that
don't forget to subscribe and hit that little notification bell to let you guys know when i put out new videos
so you can just unscrew this part here to get access to all those extra nibs on the other end we have the pen the beauty of the stand
now this is cylindrical in shape so you do need to put it upright if not and it's going to roll very easily on the table
this pen is support slightly over 8,000 levels of pressure sensitivity mati it also has sensitivity support up to sixty degrees
if you want to have a pen stand you can unscrew the part where the pen is and use it as a pen
look at a screen while you are drawing on the tablet there is no screen on this tablet on the side
we have two long strips of rubber to prevent the tablet from slipping or moving on the table so overall it looks and views
this is the driver on Mac OS which has almost the same functionality compared to the Windows driver except with Windows there's this Windows Inc functionality
which sometimes you may have to turn on or off depending on whether or not the pen has pressure with the app that you are using
the instructions will appear to tell you how exactly to do that if you don't do the proper installation on Mac OS
this is where you can configure the shortcuts for all those buttons and will in the drop down menu on the
this is where you can assign the functionality to the trackpad so I have this assigned to you brush size for the second function
and if you use the last trader you can create a whole new set just for illustrator or clip studio paint or whatever software you are using
I have tested this on a few drawing apps such as Photoshop minivan paint Pro clip studio paint creature affinity photo and most of the apps
let me just change the brush size using the wheel so as I the will you can see the brush size changes
Mac OS so pay attention to the shape of the cursor as I turned pen so now it's vertical now it's horizontal now as I draw
if you have issues with your software you can try and install different versions of driver and test so the one that's working for me with
K you may have to switch from wind tab to tablet PC or from tablet PC to win tap so right now
Android there is no way to configure the shortcut buttons or the will the overall drawing performance of tako pro and the pen is terrific
so if you are thinking of getting a graphics tablet for digital art or digital painting you can consider the deco pro this medium model
which has a drawing area of 9 by 5 inches which is still a rather comfortable size to work with that is 40
there's a little card with instructions or word to download the drivers and manuals and such will be helpful which will be helpful with installation
a little later on now to tell itself can be easily lifted from the boxes in this little tab right here which
well thing i was quite intrigued by our these numbers at the top of the screen which are apparently called soft keys
where you can customize them to corner with whatever shortcut state you want and speaking of a suppressed keys just have like holes it comes with a whopping 12
Express keys or the range to the left of the screen in these two columns here setting the tablet side in a rest or bus
it's made of a nice matte black plastic but the part where you grip it has this slightly soft rubbery feel
the tablet is automatically set in pen mode which basically means that the area on the tablet corresponds to the area of the screen
so say if you move your pen to the top corner of the tablet the mouse or brush also moves to the top corner of the screen for me
I've always used my pen tablets in mouse mode which doesn't have that one-to-one correspondence and this isn't a huge problem obviously
it's just a thing to be aware of especially if you're like me and you used to use a Wacom tablet those usually came with the mouse mode option
I never used to use orange shadows with this character before which is a lot because I usually love going for those complementary color schemes
give your computer and the new drivers a chest and bingo and calibrate and they'll usually do the trick one thing that
it had a few issues with calibrating with my program and some pen pressure bugs but for a cheap fifty to eighty dollar tablet
and as you would expect they're totally customizable like all of the other 16 inch displays out there that I've reviewed the screen is not bonded
that means when your pen tip hits the glass you can see the cursor below it and there is that gap in space
it's pretty solid and it gonna move once you get it set up although I should mention that at the lowest angle
it's a little bit tippy especially if you press in on the corners tilting me up just a little bit helps that a lot
I've gotten to the point where I just disabled those as soon as I get a tablet with them I find myself always accidentally pressing them while
I get this jitter and one of the things I've been trying to do in recent reviews is is kind of come up with a jitter scale
I don't think it it kills it but it's definitely there and something you should be aware of so here is my test
I'm gonna take a look at this pen in Photoshop and I'm gonna turn on stroke smoothing and I'm going to take a look
I drew most of my artwork that you see in the background here with about fifteen percent on to get a clean line about the question parrot
the more lag you're gonna get and when you get some of that lag it reduces accuracy if I'm closing circles or a shape
I felt like it was something that I can knock out pretty easily and I would kind of classify it in the acceptable range
it really just comes down to that pen jitter and if you want to pick up something that doesn't and when
now the catch here is is that you can get $50 off this display right now which butches it under three hundred dollars
so is it worth it to you to save some money on there and knock out that pen shape yourself or would you rather just get something
I've ever reviews that was manufactured by Veeck and overall I have to say if this is your first time out
and they didn't pay me to say anything it just sent me the tablet and asked me to try it out and tell you what
I'm just going to unbox it and show you what comes inside the box the first one you open the box
when you try to work with them you know the little nib doesn't bounce even the tiniest bit and then it starts to hurt your hand after a while
the driver at that could be fixed later on with driver updates and it might even be as I'm using Krita
I usually work at a five by seven inch or 8 by 10 inch canvas at 600 dots per inch and so it is a pretty big canvas size
and so if this tablet can't handle larger canvasses it's kind of not good for professionals so that's a pretty big downfall of the tablets by the way
there might be a new driver update or I might have figured out the solution to this problem so please check the description if you want to know
I used the tablet wireless and with the USB in it and so the whole smoothness thing I try to get around it any way I could
there's going to be links down in the description where you can get it and yeah let me know if this review was kind of helpful for you
I'm going to be putting out another video tomorrow so be prepared for that and then obviously on Sunday regular uploading schedule
but now you can just adjust it really easily with the adjustable scan you can just incline it up and down depending on your drawing preference
but that's good because you shouldn't be drawing on a flat surface for a long time anyways because like I said neck issues
I've used this one holds up really well like I said this ice is great and the screen is awesome PT
2200 screen is laminated and has a protective film that gives it almost paper texture which helps our pad not slide and mimics traditional art
I like that when I was first trying the color came out differently on my monitor but I've noticed that happens with almost everything I've used
you can individually adjust each letter to most accurately match your monitor and mine came out just fine after that the PT
I used to stab with I lost pressure sensitivity and so I just went on there and I was able to fix it by uninstalling and reinstalling the driver
I consider less and investment yourself messing this up right now because it might be four hundred and thirty dollars but in the future
let's click on a whole bunch of things so you can see how it looks gonna do some Street View over here you can see the Eiffel Tower
you're gonna test a little bit of video because this is really the cool thing about this and that's kind of where I wanted
yeah there's some stuff going on so there's there is Matt Google Marketplace it's easy to install the Google Marketplace you just click on GF suave cuss
it's better with a with a bluetooth mouse and keyboard on the TV but you can use the device as well so these videos are getting really long
Pro that you see here now you could swap out the duck head adapter you see here and plug in this extension cable you see instead now
one cool thing about this tablet is that you can charge up the battery up to 50 percent in just 30 minutes using this
65 watt fast charger as far as weight goes a tablet with the attached keyboard weighs in it only 2.5 nine pounds okay
HP sure view in degree to privacy screen which is a full HD IPS LED backlit screen with a resolution of 1920 by 12
now let's take a closer look at the tablet itself and all the connectivity ports that come with it ok so this is the back of the tablet earlier
here you have your fingerprint scanner and in the bottom portion of the you do have your kickstand which is quite different than that of the surface pro
it was that it was a little bit hard to take out the kickstand but once you do get your fingers under it then

It comes with 8 shortcut buttons that, as you can see, they have some very practical symbols, and 16 soft keys on the active area.
It comes with 2 customizable buttons, and this darker part here is made of some rubber material which provides a firmer grip on the pen.
There’s 8 of them so you’ve got nibs for a long time ^w^ Then the cable; it’s a normal USB, it holds no mystery.
As the instructions says we’ll go to Huion’s website, onto the Support tab and Download, here we’ll search the model of our product, the operating system of our computer,
To customize the buttons and soft keys we just select the button and click on the bar at the center of the image and this window will pop up.
we can input keyboard combinations, mouse and other interesting options such as Switch Screen for those who are using more than one monitor.
the pen does indeed detect the pressure, and on the one at the top we can adjust the sensitivity to our needs.
Moreover, the tilt recognition seems to work really well on Photoshop! All the brushes perform very nicely, pressure works perfectly just as the buttons and shortcuts.
It’s as easy as picking the correct adapter for our device and plugging it to the USB cable of the tablet.
Haha! xD The tablet is compatible with Android 6.0 and beyond, so if your device is using a previous OS you should update it.
As you can see when the tablet is being used on Andred the Working Area gets reduced to a bit smaller than the half of it
(the part marked with red on the image at the top right), , and we’ll have to use the device on vertical/portrait mode.
Let’s see what can I tell you about this tablet; Even though the tablet itself is about 35x24 cm, the working area is a bit smaller
Now let’s talk about what might be the real important issue for many people; the sensitivity and AF (activation force) of the pen.
And the AF is super super small, just a simple brush of the pen over the surface and it already starts drawing a line.
The drivers are good, I think they have all the necessary stuff and they work perfectly so nothing to complain there.
Remember that if you have any doubts you can leave them on the comments section and I’ll try to get back to you as soon as possible
um everyone's having an awesome day you can already feel the uh but this has definitely a good internal pad in there
was you know when you're drawing along with the fact that that's wireless medium sized smudge which i actually have one of these so this doesn't fit
i'll be wearing this one but if it does i'll be able to carry this one around with me here in the studio so these definitely come in handy
and this is the uh zen slab spin tablet medium and for more game news reviews product reviews like this and tech stay tuned to sdgt entertainment
XP pen for sending this over this will be my honest review of the deco zero 3 to test out this tablet
I worked with smaller tablets before that are similar to this and for me they were just too little so this was a really nice size
I made it the zoomin zoom-out shortcut and I didn't use it that much but about halfway through my piece I changed it to the bigger brush
I will say though that once I got to the more subtle stages of my painting the levels of pressure sensitivity were quite nice
it was just one more step than usual so I was able to get over this point after I developed a muscle memory for it
I was able to move from place to place around my house with my tablet and laptop and just be able to draw on Photoshop wherever I wanted
board and the premise was the ability to draw and doodle on something other than pen and regular paper which could be wasteful with
what's different here if you look very closely is that the stylus does also have a end which is very similar to a regular eraser
the board itself has the exact same kind of construction as well as a very lightweight portfolio as the other versions
it seems like all the marks will be rather heavy and is a little bit easy to make some accidental marks
it's still not gonna make any marks because you have to exert a lot of a lot more pressure to make a mark here
all you need to do is tap on the erase key two times tapping once doesn't do anything so it's a safety mechanism but twice
whatever you've drawn so let's do some more doodles like maybe a quick graph here and if I do something here and I want to erase it
it definitely doesn't take up any space at all if you just take it with you in your backpack but again
so they wanted you to just get a new board when the battery died so this is a extra feature now
and you know avoid paying a bit more here and after say there are some compromises which I have found in regards to the device
I have encountered with it before making purchase and we can just start off here with the build quality of the device
it does pick up quite a bit of fingerprints on the back as you can see which you might have to keep cleaning down a bit
it's not going to win any awards for you know actually being like attractive device but does the job and the main thing which
and that's the main thing really so maybe we can just go to another site here such as GameSpot and is it going
I think the main issue that I've actually had with this tablet is not to do with the performance of the processor which is quad-core Intel processor
if you want the best one in the in the class with the higher specs let me just say at the outset get a Samsung Galaxy Tab
RCA the resolution on these cheapo tablets is 1024 by 600 as opposed to the Galaxy Tab the samsung galaxy tab which is 1280 by 800
the tab light II has the exact same specs as this RCA but for more than double the price at $70 so that's just not worth it now

I got chang-keuk easy to subscribe anything about on the Bahama doulica momentum of the next video made optically ciao ciao
I'm so sorry for my inconsistency of with videos I've honestly been really absorbed with playing warframe recently but this isn't the topic of this video today
this is not a sponsored video or anything and we have had this tablet for over a year by now and it has been incredible
so far it's smooth comes with a punch a bunch of pen nibs and has a pen that doesn't need recharging when I bought it on Amazon
for this tablet as it turns out it becomes kind of scratchy after heavy use and another downside to some might be
but you know fully customizable it comes with a disk but it tells you to just go to the website and download the latest drivers from there
there's still some out there that may need a media consumption device or maybe a light use laptop replacement whatever it may be
Tab s - the newest and supposedly the best of the best considering Apple didn't even announced a new nine point seven inch Apple iPad

the s2 comes in at nine point two eight ounces with the chassis being five point five millimeters thin and with that being said
on and off with volume rocker buttons below directly in the middle is the built-in microphone and to the right of that is the micro
despite being so thin the bezel keeps the tablet feeling stiff and the rear panel itself has very minimal amounts of play and the rear
I'll admit you probably won't even tell it all and again being honest I was hoping for a bit more though for that
those black bars are back again but the trade-off if you're more of a website reader news article connoisseur and eReader
the new aspect ratio does benefit with an entire page practically on one screen no needing to flip to the next page and so on
indeed not an apples to apples comparison since it's a phone versus a tablet but Samsung has typically placed their best of the best and their flagship devices regardless
if it's a tablet or phone yet with that being said while running currently from the factory android 5.1.1 and Samsung's overlay
you do have multi window mode allowing up to two select apps to open at the same time handy for multitasking
Flipboard will always be available basically curated news articles in journalism based on your specific selections overall from I use this is still a very capable device
I'm honestly spoiled by the quick charging capabilities on the on the smart phones that they have so with everything being offered by Samsung
in my humble opinion it's still a great device by itself when compared to the next premium tablet maker as I've been compared moderately in this video
Samsung really made adjustments based on market changes removing the LED flash no IR blaster and didn't continue their attempt in class-leading specs example the processor in ram

I was asked by the Huyen company to review a tablet for them and more specifically it's the Ouya on HS 64 creative pen tablet
I don't want this to hold things for but math me is a QuickStart guide manual and a whole bunch of different languages
the pen was very accurate with the mouse on the screen so I was very happy about that and it does everything
I had no problems the only somewhat con that I found with it which isn't much of a con at all
I never used them except maybe three times when I remember to but this is probably because I am already as to having hot keys on my keyboard
and if you're like me and you don't install or uninstall programs often on your computer be sure to look up tutorials on YouTube to help you out
I don't know which tablet is inside but I will list a name of it and it will be in our video description
this is the box and we can go ahead and we can open the box to see us inside you can find this on eBay or Amazon
also this is a 16 gig tablet and the charger should be 5 volts 2 amps also to let you know as well
this will be 24 and we can now go into the interface of the tablet so we do have an interface here for children
nanometers you can see over here the the old generations of of course this five years ago they had the PMA 400 which was the first device
you see how much more compact it is which is really nice kind of thing you see how it really made it smaller
AMT which kind of a fad thing but I had up to 250 gigabytes of hard disk and right last year this is the Archos 5 internet tablet
there's like 25% smaller screen but the device is 30% lighter than this one the device is 30% more compact it's smaller 30% smaller than this one
and it's about 30% cheaper as well because this one was released at 2:49 for 8 gigabytes last year and this one is $1.99 for 16 gigabytes

I'll do the video with the the Samba file share but I can show it all so that it can play back through the 720p video
then use this one because sometimes it registers quick so it's probably recommended to use the mouse and keyboard for well

I said to a Iost resolution available okay on the game - this mousse is very hard to play behind the camera
you canceled the spot and you have to believe me if you want to play this game on tablet is not good is not in this tablet
I guess well there is some luggage but I don't know if it's doesn't bother me to imagine what happen at is when I type on the soft keyboard
I do not know whether it is but overall if you just want to browse the web and play some crucial games
yes there are some bugs with a touchscreen it appears and the camera is powerful almost useless as I said Wi-Fi is good
inch tablet one gig of ram 16 gig onboard 5 megapixel camera on the back to make pixel camera on the front
it's it's definitely got a little bit of power to it but in saying that as well it's also got quite a bit of bulk in it as well
this one is a little bit different compared to other tablet so you can actually remove this hold that cover and you can replace the battery with most tablets
I guess if you're using it in in portrait mode it won't be a huge issue because that's the way you're holding it in other ways
I actually find this power button to be too too hidden so when I'm using it and I want to turn it on
I'm kind of where is it and then I find a button I would have liked a more distinct button somewhere
here's where you can actually if you have this decode plugged in you hit that USB same thing and it works I've tested it
actually you know do some printing in the cloud which is just an awesome awesome feature as well and obviously over
I don't want to record anything navigation the whole that's really built into here when I go into the camera you know
I don't mind the camera but the house holding like this and I was covering up the lens which you know
and it's around the same price point as you know your iPad twos and your even zooms and are on the same sort of price
the good the good news is that if you're in the market for a laptop you actually might get one of these for free
but you'll get a free one so if you are buying a new laptop and this may help you swing the decision
obviously save something to USB if you want to plug it straight into here and you're looking at things again so this is a really good value
I just think it's a little loan based when you put them side by side with other tablets throughout there it could be a little bit more attractive
Under there you can find the tablet pen, a micro-usb cable aswell as a HUGE amount of spare pen nibs, there are 20 of them in total.
Although, I have to emphasize on the fact that, if you plan on using this tablet solely for playing osu!, the pen buttons will get in the way.
If you accidentally press one of the two buttons when playing (and I can assure you it happens pretty often) , your game will stutter
I even found out to my surprise that the refresh rate of the XP-Pen was actually higher than my Wacom Bamboo, it felt much more responsive.
One thing I have to add about it however, is that it gets dirty very easily, and I weigh my words.
I know I'm not the only one to have very sweaty hands, but to give you an idea, this is the tablet 20 minutes after I first tried it.
pretty quickly, may it be from sweat or other things, in case you're a fatass like me that regularly eats in front of his computer.
config is super annoying as shown earlier, especially for osu! players, that are forced to disable them both to truely feel comfortable.
but in general when you're combining something like metal and glass is that when you're holding it kind of like this
which causes your thumb to start sweating which basically causes your finger to catch really easily on the glass so it doesn't collide as smoothly as possible
you know kind of like this with my fingers wrapped around it and my hands are not big enough so I usually have to carry it like this
okay so talk a little bit about the display or starting on a display the build quality of the tablets overall
how much glare there is in there so a matte screen protector again would help a lot with that okay last thing
I want to talk about with regards to the screen is gonna be the touch sensitivity and this was in a little bit of a weird place
it's like one step below very very good so for example my Xiaomi me8 this one has great touch sensitivity as most other flagship phones
the thing about this is that there's like zero bass so I'm just gonna play this and you guys can listen to it
you just have one forward-firing speaker that's gonna be on the top of the tablet and yeah that's basically it all right so so far
we talked about the build quality of the sound and the display so far none of them have really been that outstanding here
my car is actually a little bit faster than this which is surprising considering the CPU from an Android ahead unit is like from 2017
I want to talk about the one area of this tablet that is the reason why I like it so much
I didn't really try it out that much because I don't really do location on the town but if you do yeah I probably should have tested it up
I basically play games to test them out on the tablets and then I go game on my real computer PC master-race okay but yeah
seven hours manga three hours candy crush you could probably use this for 11 12 hours straight of reading manga reading comics or even reading books
you need a tablet with a decent screen and good battery life and this thing has both of those if you want it for gaming
just click on them and then assign a specific key to those soft keys you can either and able the soft key or disable the soft
I wonder mapping area to be freer so that the surface of the tablet will match the screen and if you are left-handed user you can check this button
I would say it's almost as sensitive as Wacom tablet and feeling of the nib on the surface of the tablet is very similar to walk home as well
some of the graphics tablet they have this tendency to have wobbly lines especially when you are drawing straight lines but not so for this particular brand
it works very well but it doesn't work well with creat are it doesn't work well with MIDI Bank paint oh I still have this software
you give you a thumb feedback when you press on them these buttons they are assigned to keyboard shortcuts or Photoshop
I highly recommend you do some research online to see whether or not the software that you want to use whether it is supported by this tablet
I will also post a link to my text review our little mentions of the software they are supported and some of the software they are not supported
I'm gonna tell your mom about those magazines under your bed okay so the CTL 472 is one of the products from the Wacom one brand
the tablet dimensions are eight point three inches in length five point seven inches in width and 0.3 inches in height
while the active area the area you can use is six inch long and three point seven inches wide this is more than enough for an
OC player okay so for the USB that comes with the tablet it's slightly under a meter so it wasn't long enough for me
I find it very good for both drag and hover and I can even do a little bit of the tap x-play style
the only party that has cleared there has been at least like a party sake and I spent at least maybe we could sell their car
yo the [ __ ] grande play off the [ __ ] grand Peter how much I don't think you know nothing absolutely nothing 293
hey everyone so here and approached me not too long ago about reviewing one of their tablets and it finally came in the post so here
I didn't realize it while filming the unboxing that they're actually extra pen lives inside of it which is a good way
honestly let's think that's it for the video so thank you so much for watching and thank you for huion for sponsoring me bye
it comes with the USB connection cable it comes with the pen and it comes with some extra nibs that are hidden within the pen holder it has eight
I love that I can plug this into my phone and draw on my phone because that makes this very very portable
there's only the USB cable and so you could throw this in your bag take your phone or your tablet with you
I do prefer the ability to draw directly on a screen but if I have to get a tablet I can tell you right now
I'm using that one because for the amount of features that it has and for the price that you can get it for
the active area is six by three point seven five inches which is slightly smaller than 6 by 4 inches of G 640
that seals the faucet shut and as we open this up really gonna be greeted with the tablet body covered up in plastic
in great detail later there's a nib remover and lives in a small bag here and we also have a USB cable
and it's also comes in this kind of a rubbery sleeve that feels a little bit better and also comes with this velcro you know
this tablet pen is called p0 v passive pen by XP pen and it is different from the g6 40 G 430 or g5 40 models p01 passive pen
but it's not really snug to the tablet pen as in that you can kind of like pull it off while playing with it so
I have to play with this tablet for about four or five hours and that didn't really happens so you don't have to worry too much about that
I only noticed that after shooting this entire video and so yeah just throw that aside and this is what the tablet looks like
it's nice and you know kind of like matte finished look but it also has a bit of a kind of a rough plastic surface
I actually cut out my tablet area so that I can convert it from one table to another so after pressing that button
first the build quality the bill polity of this tablet is phenomenal compared to other tablets made by XV pen such as G 430 and G 640
let's say twenty five dollars it's 4s 645 eight $23 for g4 30 and $33 for g6 40 all the prices from Amazon
of course all the decisions are going to be amazingly by you but I personally believe that whatever extra you know
I don't think it's gonna be too much of a challenge for you either and as for the driver I felt like the tablet driver for g6
the g6 40 tablet driver was already my favorite tablet driver out of all drivers out there and to see something
Quick disclaimer, this is not a sponsored video, but Wacom did send me this tablet unconditionally to review as I please.
There is also the One by Wacom which is a non-display tablet, potentially adding some confusion for those of you who are searching for these devices online.
which was a more budget-friendly display tablet, but now in 2020 we see the price being lowered even more for a Wacom-quality display tablet.
who really want to draw directly onto a screen, but don't have a whole lot of money to invest in the professional-level features that often accompany display tablets.
The screen resolution is 1920x1080, and the color gamut is 72% of NTSC, which is a little over 70% Adobe RGB, or around 93% or so of sRGB.
One really cool feature is that there's virtually no bezel to interrupt your pen if you make a stroke that goes off of the active area.
The bezel will catch your pen slightly at the very edge of the tablet, but there's a pretty decent buffer zone before your pen hits that edge.
You can use pen tilt to change the angle of your brush dab or to shade with the side of your pencil.
This means that whether the legs are extended or the tablet is laying flat, it won't slide around when you draw on it.
There are no external express keys on the Wacom One, but you can get the optional Express Key Remote if you like.
And I can't help but notice that the Wacom One is kind of similar in design to the XP-Pen 15.6 Pro, but without the external buttons.
The Wacom One is compatible with PC and Mac and it requires Windows 7 or later, or Mac OS 10.13 or later.
if you're using a Samsung device, which expands to fill the active area of the tablet and you can draw just like you could on a desktop computer.
recently, where only part of the tablet can be drawn on and it only works as a mouse cursor on your phone.
I didn't have any driver issues, I can use the Wacom control panel to customize the pen button for each app individually or globally for all apps.
A couple of features that I think are cool is that this tablet can be powered by portable battery bank or a desktop or laptop via USB.
And with the bundled Premiere Rush software, vloggers can even edit their videos and view them on a larger screen without having to lug around a laptop.
If you wanted to create video tutorials where you write out math equations, you could do that with the Wacom One.
And then my last gripe is that the white color on the bottom of the tablet and the edges could collect stains over time.
2020 seems like it's going to be the year that smartphones give desktop computers a run for their money in terms of being capable digital art workstations.
Of course, phone hardware is nowhere near professional level, but for artists who are new to digital art, a phone is now a legit tool for making art.
It feels so much better to see what you're drawing underneath your pen and I'm glad the Wacom One puts that experience within the reach of more artists.
For example, you certainly can get a pen with higher pressure levels, but if the pen doesn't respond to light pressure, then what's the point?
And for all of you #iPadBros, feel free to leave your comments on my review of the MobileStudio Pro 16, because the Wacom
hey guys welcome back to another episode from China Tech and today we are checking out this super cheap LCD writing tablet
you can't erase a small bit of text so if I you know stuff this up there is actually no way to erase this
I find that just riding on this is a super quick and easy way as I said it is actually pretty easy and enjoyable to ride on this
and you know if you're someone that likes to write stuff down just randomly sort of work things out or just write sort of quick lists or something then
so we have this charging cable for the tablet this is USB and this is USB type-c we have a very nice pen case in this plastic packaging
it's very well built very strong and very hot so on this side here we can open up to review the stylus and on the other side
this is the wireless USB receiver so if you want to use the tablet wirelessly you have to connect this who your computer first because of the cylindrical design
two buttons on the side the overall feeling of holding it if use good it has a nice weight to it
screw down you can use this to change brush sizes or you can use it to scroll to zoom in zoom out you can set different functions to this
these are so useful if you want to keep the cable in a tidy manner you can use the velcro straps provided
there are some pre-configured functions for you to choose from but if you want to have your own keyboard shortcuts just choose reset customer define and here
you can enter your own keyboard shortcut now for this button here this K 6 button I'm going to choose built-in function switch
but if you want to have more functions you can choose butene functions multi select and here you have a list of functions that you can choose from so
I want to use it to zoom so these are the two functions that I want so I put a check in the check
so you can use this to zoom now and when you press again you can use this to change the brush size alright
the taper is very gradual the Photoshop sometimes we still get to see that a drop shot taper but here it's very smooth so the performance of the tablet
Pro which is a very nice drawing app as well these are the thin lines and this are the thicker lines in and thick
I'm someone who draws with a heavy hand so usually for my tablets they can get scratched up quite easily so here on the XP pen deco 0-3
and this pen doesn't require any charging so you don't have to charging cable to the back of the pen like some other brands
I thought the predecessors an excellent value for a long time but the new one has to compete against a very strong competitor from Samsung
I'm NJ for my next tablet comm and in this review you will learn if and for who is this tablet as a great value
that's important to know because if you're looking for a sub $200 tablet you will have to choose between the two
I also checked what other people are writing about this tablet and I've read on several occasions that reviewers said the performance is too weak
that's the case in general because it's 9.8 millimeters thick which is quite a lot at the same time it weighs 500 for grants
well it's a very cheap so I think it's okay that it does not play in the highest league regarding its design
still somebody seems where we were passed you can get it not only in black but also in plum white and Twilight blue now
those colors make it look a bit higher end than it really is by the way my last Fire HD 10 got visible scratches on
next to it is a power button and on the same side are a headphone jack and the volume controls on the right side
fire OS is based on the open source version of Android and there's nothing to do with what Google is doing
it's interesting to note that the Fire HD 10 2019 is the first Amazon tablet on which the thigh OS is based on Android and 9
please include kinnor books from video audible and the Amazon App Store some of Amazon's own apps are pre-installed as well
life - its performance is very good for its price but the bear quality could be a bit better it seems to be robust but it does not feel
I end with a price tag of $150 it is super cheap and I think it's the best tablet in exactly this price class
well at least if you're going to install the Google Play Store without it I wouldn't use it if you've got the predecessor already
I think it's a simpler and easier alternative because you don't have to install the place or yourself instead you get the same operating system
but it's a solid small tablet that works well as long as you don't have to high expectations there's no cheap a 10-inch tablet that
if you have any questions please feel free to write me in the comments below and check out my next ever calm
items and this particular tablet is selling on their website for us $50 and that includes international shipping and one-year warranty so it's quite affordable
I think or some sort of material that goes across the whole surface area and this is the drawing area it's 10 by 6 inches
now here this is the USB type-c pot for the USB cable and this switch here this is for turning the trackpad on and off overall the design
there is a little friction so it's not like sliding on a glass surface there is some friction which gives you control when you are drawing
if you are left-handed you can turn this around and turn this cable around like this so that a cable can go up as well since
install the driver and for Mac OS users you can find a tablet driver here and System Preferences so now I am controlling the cursor using the tablet
so let's take a look at what you can do with this driver one of the features that you see here you have them on
and this is where you can customize that 8 physical chakra buttons the functionality is the same as customizing the site button
I will look out for how smooth it is when it turns the corner and here it's very smooth and a transition between a thin and thick
great thin lines big lines and the transition that's great the lines they will taper quite well works well with Crete are and this is MIDI bang Mac version
I'm using Windows 10 Pro under surface Pro 2017 so this is the text review if I have any updates if there is a new driver
I'm going to test it again and update my review so you can check out this text review the link will be in the video description below
I did all that but still I wasn't able to get it working well with Windows except for those two apps so yeah
yeah doesn't work whenever you're playing with the tablet nope so there's no touch pad by the way bt-dubs so back to the tablet
let's talk about the interior a little bit shall we you have 64 gigs of storage on this as well as 2 gigs of ram
it's a full touchscreen display very very responsive it's LED HD and it has great viewing angles for this kind of display
it also has micro SD card and you get your headphone in Jack's last mic out and your dual speakers power and volume so everything you could ever want
it also has bluetooth and wireless connectivity so my pros and cons for this device in the time that I enjoyed it which I quite did
time is an Android tablet yep manufacturers are still making them and Vanko very kindly sent me out their matrix pad s30
I'm gonna run through the specs as well and also show you some things in action and this is the product packaging first of all really nice packaging
and you can expand that storage with up to 128 gigabyte micro sd card so good specs to start things off
let's take a closer look at it and you'll get to see exactly how this performs so this is what the tablet looks like
and let's make sure this is running at 1080 so here we go so full HD and it looks like a really nice screen as you can see
let's pop the speakers on as well so you can hear how the speakers sound so as you can hear there
if we pop into settings the settings are laid out really nicely as you'd expect it's just a standard sort of Android experience really
let me zoom right in give you a closer look at that very very detailed photo and again very natural colors now
let's not add an account and let's just go to the geeky noise web site do visit the Vanco website as well
we give you a little guide around the tablet as well now of course you've got the 10.1 inch IPS display on the front which is really nice
then if we look on the back side we've got the flash and that rear facing camera so overall really good option and in fact
I've recommended things like the Amazon Kindle before the fight sorry not the Amazon Kindle the fire HD range from Amazon
I think a better option because with the Fire HD range you have to sort of side load the Google services so to get these on
there's a little bit of fiddling to get these installed but the fact that this comes pre-installed with them and it's got a really nice
thank you very much for tuning in life aleksander than saying it's amazing the quality you can get these days for such a small price
this is ideal for somebody who doesn't want a very high power tablet but somebody that wants something that's going to perform really nicely now
the cameras are a little bit slow to react but the results are good so do bear that in mind and the performance
and then if we head over to the left-hand side you'll find the power button and on the right-hand side you'll also find the volume up or down button
I just I didn't think they needed to point that out so I mean people could be like this but you know that's just my preference
you know just considering that the price loss cost one hundred and ninety six dollars which is roughly around one hundred and fifty pounds
I wasn't expecting it to considering this is sorry to say about a China branded tablet and let's all be fair
I mean I could hold in one hand at least and use my other free hand to you know you work the display but it feels really great
but unfortunately the 2 megapixel front-facing camera on the front of the device takes some really really bad photos as you guys can see now
so it's actually a cortex 8 processor so that's basically eight cores clocked at 1.7 gigahertz each and as you guys can imagine
obviously power and performance from the processor but during the game is also a lot of things going on in the background
the lighting is also running and the shadows and the graphics and everything just comes together and it performs really really well on this tablet
so if you're not playing games or you know you're kind of just browsing the web or running multiple applications in the background
I felt really unsure whether I should review it or not mainly because it was a China branded sir tablet and it was from dhj and you know
you know this tablet just performs really really well as a whole especially for its price anyway guys this has been the review of the chewy
i'd advise you guys to go ahead and check it out and you may be impressed with though if you do purchase it
they're not reviewing this video either before it is posted and all the opinions you're about to hear are my own
six nine pounds or 766 grams when it is docked with the keyboard dock it goes up to a thousand 66 grams or two point three five pounds
it has grabs it and pulls the pulls everything together really nicely and there's no real lag either when they reconnect
the keyboard of course will dock in like so now this is a twelve inch display this is an IPS display
SSD and it has AC wireless now what I really like about this design is that the kickstand goes in kind of the opposite direction of the surface
it does make for a much more comfortable typing scenario here especially when you're in laptop mode but even on a desk as well
you can position it pretty much any which way you want all the way down to the desk if you wish to do that so really
they basically sit in between the keyboard dock and the tablet one of them is going to be a projector dock with an HDMI output
so there's going to be some little attachments you can add to this to kind of extend its capabilities a little bit
and there's also a fingerprint reader over here for getting into your machine with the new authentication methods that are available to you in
Windows 10 and you've got a camera on the back eight megapixel camera actually with a flash built-in too so battery life isn't the best on this
they'll give you another four or five hours or so so there is an option to get a little bit more battery life
that can hold the pen when you don't have the keyboard nearby that's a little bit weird for me but you do have an option to use that
I does have a gorilla glass screen so you should be ok with pushing down a little bit hard on it
we'll visit my youtube page and pull up one of my 4k videos here so we have this playing at 4k starts up very quickly again
we got a score of 21,000 172 that does put it slower than the Dell XPS 12 that is running with a similar core m5 processor and
you'll see in another benchmark in a few minutes that they perform about the same on some 3d graphics stuff so
there's really no keyboard lag either as I'm typing things out so I think if you are doing productivity kinds of things on here like Excel Word PowerPoint
this is going to do quite well especially the kinds you might get from the Windows Store or some of the indie games perhaps on Steam
you're going to do well but just don't expect to run the latest and greatest triple-a title on here as I always caution now
USB charging cable she can also be used for syncing okay so I've been using this tablet for about a week now and so far
USB ports one works for charging and both work for just connecting on the go flash drives or hard drives or other peripheral devices
and then there's also a reset button over here and finally a micro SD card slot which can expand the storage on this device
goes it's only about 11 gigs right here so but like I was saying you can expand the storage on the device through this micro SD card slot
I wanted to show a game to show game performance which is also pretty good so go ahead and load this up so this is fruit ninja
and lastly what I wanted to do is show how this tablet fits in the case here right slides in pretty easily as you can see right there
which will plug into one of the ports okay so so this being an Android tablet which is made by the software is made by Google Google
Docs is on here so I wanted to go ahead and show just how it would be to type up documents on here
it also comes with the stylus right here that you can use to pretty easily navigate the screen as well as if you
there's a few apps you can download for for handwriting or for drawing and you can use the stylus with it
so this tablet some other specs it also has Wi-Fi 802 and is the highest band that it goes to it also has bluetooth 4.0
we have a tablet and this is one of the biggest tablets that I've seen so far but in all fairness we have an eleven point six inches screen
we have six degrees of RAM 64 gigs of internal storage and unactivated copy of Windows 10 the home Edition since we have an activated copy of Windows 10
all around the screen would be somewhat smaller because the tablet would be a bit easier to use basically and hold this tablet with 750 grams
the tablet are the speakers so you have one on the left one on the right but they don't seem to get that loud
but the speaker's aren't that loud moving on to the eleven point six inches display so we have a resolution of 1080p and the screen
Chrome if you open the Windows Store or anything like that it's a bit slower than your regular mini PC that has the Intel and 34:15
if you watch youtube videos and you use Microsoft edge you can select a maximum resolution of 4k however the screens resolution
and that means that you can just turn the tablet left or right to control a car or anything like that and in this case
ok but don't expect that this is gonna do good forum like high graphics intensive games there is also a built-in microphone
the quality is not the best but it should be okay for my skype course or anything like that and since this is so big
I keep on trying over and over on all the devices that worked very very well so most video files are gonna do just fine on this tablet
the videos don't go that smooth so you may want to lower the resolution to 480p for a better viewing experience
I haven't seen in a while and next those two SIM card slots the tablet can also take an SD card
the tablet itself is mostly made up of plastic so the back the sides pretty much is made up of plastic and I forgot to mention
you're gonna leave on a scratch marker on the screen so keep that in mind or buy yourself a screen protector for it
and if you don't have patience like me this tablet is definitely not good enough for you but for a kid
I think is gonna be good enough to watch some videos and play some very light games but other than that
but if you're planning to take pictures with this tablet you're probably better off if you don't so yes this is $70 and you get a 10.1
so this is just designed to watch movies basically and you can't even watch movies at 720p because most of them don't do that
both for people looking to buy tablets, AND for artists who will get contacted by these companies with offers to receive a “free” tablet to review.
I’ve had ok experiences with tablet companies despite the fact they’ve asked me to do stupid things, some of which I was too naive to say no to.
In the end I pasted all their junk in a separate section underneath what I wanted my video description to be.
So you might be getting a $100 tablet, but be footed with a surprise $20 customs fee by the shipping company.
If you look into the rules for these giveaways, they require your viewers to do stuff like sign up for marketing
A company asked me if I would like to review a new tablet that had not been released yet and test it.
“testing” was extra: locating issues with the tablet, reporting those issues, checking to see if they were resolved after the company made changes.
I spent 2 full-time days testing the product, they fixed their drivers, and I still had to do the tablet review on top of that.
In one of my more recent reviews, the video needed to be done 1 week after receiving the tablet. That’s crazy! That’s crazy.
This monologue is a response to two other videos, the original by Aaron Rutten and the second by the guy I go to for tablet reviews, Brad Colbow.
I want to thank you for stopping by to check out this review of the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 one Android slate and there
Galaxy Note 10 one Wi-Fi only model as the name implies it has a 10.1 inch screen and everything that's included with
we have a charger and sync cable and in this little baggie are some replacement tips for the S Pen Stylus
it also helps that the speakers are a fairly good quality so the sound coming out of here is pretty good
one of the drawbacks of this setup is that there's a ridge on the front of the note so when you're holding it you kind of feel
you know it's it's not a huge issue but definitely doesn't feel as good as other tablets that are perfectly smooth on the front now
Note 10 one as well right here is a five megapixel rear facing camera with an LED flash right next to it and down
perception with the note 10:1 and while the implementation isn't perfect the ability to have multiple windows open is something that's really cool and exclusive to this device
so the next thing we want to show you in action is the s-pen let me slide it from its slot
now you see when you pull the stylus out this tray of apps also pops out you have s note s planner crammed physics
you don't have to use it but you just have more precision and control really the S Pen is just like a more precise fingertip
I'm reaching around a tripod here so if you go to write with your finger you know it works well enough
but it's a definitely a nice addition if you want to use your tablet for more than just consumption nice move on
this is the Lynx vision eight by Windows if it is a 64-bit quad-core Intel Atom processor a rear and front facing camera it features a headphone port micro
you can play all of your favorite downloaded games from other gaming clients such as steam giving you an endless supply of entertainment on the go
8 is much more than a gaming console you can detach the controller from the dock and enjoy the full tablet experience pre-installed office mobile apps and full
near as vibrant as an iPad with the Retina display or your 4k Ultra HD television but games do look really sharp
really deep into the system folders there's 32 gigabytes of storage available but you can add up to a 128 gigabyte microSD card for additional storage
it's an 8 inch considering this set up being an Xbox controller all the things in the features that you can do with this system it's really well priced
there are no retailers that I've been able to find that actually sell the unit in the United States or will even ship to the United States
DTS audio what that's going to allow you to do with compatible headphones you can create a 5.1 surround sound right in your headphones
the screen resolution is 1280 by 800 pixels and it also supports IPS display so you get great viewing angles on it
quad core processors and two gigs of ram you also find that it has 16 gigabytes of storage but it's expandable to 128 gigabytes with external memory card
let me show you how to customize some of the screens and some more features about the tablet when you get this
see under your app tray you want to go over here to the one that says mini movie and with the mini movie
it's just raining tablets here lately and this one's claim to fame is pretty big build quality and nice specs at a very reasonable price
otherwise there's great plastic as matches the body you might not even notice in first and this is the micro SD card slot
support you've got a rotation lock switch right here your volume buttons five megapixel camera with LED flash on the banner picks ok shots
2.4 gigahertz doesn't have dual band like the Motorola Xoom as Bluetooth 2.1 + edr and it also has a front camera here for web conferencing 2 megapixel
now we're comparing the ACR a500 android tablet on the bottom with the Motorola Xoom up top both Android 3.0 one honeycomb tablets with 10.1
something works better but really they're about the same and now we're comparing the Iconia a 500 on the bottom with the iPad
2 up top again like the zoom the Iconia is longer across but otherwise they're fairly similar in size of course the iPad is a bit thinner
another thing is awful long to hold and in terms of settings tap and hold here you can change your font size right now
Lumiere read directory on the internal flash storage area and then you can put your side loaded epub books into the Lummi read folder
Nemo player video player streaming radio visual YouTube and Acer is cleared on five which you've also seen on things like the Acer Iconia 60 120 notebook
so let's take a look at the 3d photo browser so this is a search 3d album which uses the accelerometer and multi-touch action
I'm not sure that that's really much better than gallery in the end but it also works here for showing photos and so on
look good hmm okay now for comparison and here we have the same exact video playing on the Motorola Xoom and playing just fine
of course this is less demanding but still it looks really nice fills the screen and you call these good in high quality now
you've got the play button here if you want to use the resolution switching not really there yet then it plays a 360 see when embedded
I go up to 480 if we choose full screen and you can't control that works fine too so there you have a plus versus the iPad
there's a couple of games pre-installed on here and we've got heroes of Sparta HD there we've also made for speed we'll take a look at heroes of Sparta
graphics are pretty good skip the rest of that so really nice looking graphics very fluid gameplay once again the Nvidia dual core Tegra 2 CPU with GPU
I just cleaned it and I'm gonna put my hand on it and you'll see the fingerprints show up pretty easily
I'm holding on to it pretty well even with just one hand so there's that and I think it's pretty good
that will suffice for most if not all people but if you are person let's say you have an s8 and you and you buy this tablet
and it's tinny in a very unusual way in that it's actually it actually feels a bit hollow which is very strange
let's talk quickly about the battery life on the tech class m89 and the bad new life here is it's not bad but it's it could be better
I definitely think it has about a five thousand milliamp hour battery in the tablets paired with the mtk CPU I was able to get around seven hours
I read a lot of comics over the days but yeah so the battery life here is not super amazing but it definitely could be better
I left the tablet on for a long time after doing my my initial review and it lost very little battery
especially in a tablet which is not something you use very as often as your cell phone so standby is super important
I know there are some people who will want Android Oreo on all their latest devices but I don't really care the software works
so that's actually very good and I'm pleased with how well tech class has optimized the software on here multitasking is a little bit of a different issue
I have mostly light apps so that's fine but I'll show you what happens when you have a heavy app opened and that actually has an impact
RAM I have cleared all the RAM and tried to play this game but it still would not play just kept on crashing on me
I'll show you a lighter game that you can try and you'll see that the performance is very very good so here in this game
it's it's a pretty fairly well optimised game so there's that to be aware of if you want to buy this
that's something that doesn't occur very often but in terms of games you should be able to play pretty much anything else
are you in search of a cheap reliable tablet to use as a student or maybe just for some other general purpose usage
if this is your first time here take scenes array and you're interested in tech and all some tech related projects and videos
so it's quite a few freebies with the tablet so tablets in a case with a keyboard and a screen protector
what are the specs of the tablet beside the stuff that I mentioned earlier it comes with a media tech Mt
I've made use of this tablet for almost a week now and yeah some of the pros and cons that I have noticed about the tablet
the consequence is that it takes a standard cell so the big the big first-generation some it takes that it has very poor camera and the screen
you can go ahead and check that out and that brings us to the end guys a reminder the Texians array is in search of sponsors
let me know what sort of videos you'd like to see and even let me know if you have any video suggestions for me
the back of the tablet shows a metal-like body giving it a premium look included in your package is of course the box
this is where you can see the power button the volume buttons the microphone and the charging port as this tablet has a sim tray
i've downloaded two more drawing apps on medibang it produces decent lines unlike with ibis paint unfortunately on infinite painter it produces the same result as ibis paint
and it's just a fun thing to play with another customization feature is changing the color of the interface and the application's icon shapes
the pressure of this pen is 255, the softest in the fine tuning to much more smoothen your experience in pen touch
welp told you i already opened it so if you want to buy it in lower price, watch out for the sale period in Lazada
this isn't a uniquely designed tablet because it is looking head-on you can see the silver trim you're also greeted with generously sized bezels holding in landscape
I did mention at the end of my review on the 10 inch device that I think the performance issues are software based not a hardware issue
HD which scans your permissions for applications has an app manager ad blocker and also the speed up utility which I didn't use much beyond that
the location of the rear 8 megapixel camera is in an interesting one while holding your device in landscape and you launch the camera instantly
Lenovo does a great job at supplying you with manual adjustments for the camera white-balance brightness/contrast and other controls to get a decent shot
in person it looks very sharp actually so I quite like the I quite like the look of the screen right
you can expand with the micro sd card and it's got this coating on the screen as well to stop fingerprints
Caesars of the asus streaming media apps or for document you can store them in sort of central locations and stream them to this device
Amazon store so you see this is clean install and it's got quite a lot of install on there and some things you don't need like McAfee Security
it's really for browsing consumer media and it's okay for that just a little bit on the slow side as it opens up so
Delhi haven't opened the page and as BBC and it's pretty sweet pretty quick switch between tabs and fairly reasonable for browsing
so that's that's a good thing although I notice yeah it's open that page so a little bit on the sluggish side box
okay watching media run like that and and it's nice and bright took clear so very good for watching video so great for watching
I play a BBC iPlayer or Netflix and YouTube and the other apps like that so good for watching videos on good for media consumption
switched off double tap and it wakes up and I think that's a great idea and I really like that feature
and and that's a little tablet great for browsing the odd game and video consumption so that's the Acer Iconia 17.7 exposure
every tablet that gets released all one in Chrome OS Android Windows and iPad OS especially when considering that they lean over to at Chromebook oestrus $279
SD card slot well at least a USB C to 3.5 millimeter audio adapter is included and on the positive side
on the front we get a two megapixel webcam and the main camera has a resolution of 8 megapixel while the recordings of the main camera ok
usually have these days a back cover for the tablet with integrated kickstand and the keyboard included at no extra charge
it does not have any special features like backbone lighting and it's always lying flat on a table you can't angle it up
it's small but it works fine so overall the keyboard is not perfect but it works great and I think it's a fantastic value
Chrome OS is quite popular in the United States but outside I think most people are not that familiar with it
you see all installed apps if you're inside an app you can access a doc by swiping up and with gestures you can see all open apps
in both cases you can access the quick settings and notifications by tapping the date in the status bar that looks and works similar to Android
Google can improve in the future just like with an Android tablet you can install Android apps on the do a Chromebook from the Google Play Store
I think that a full HD resolution is high enough on 10 inches overall the display is a pretty good one
iPad pro has a brighter screen and similar panels from Samsung are more saturated and have higher contrast but at this price the screen is great
Netflix in the browser with HD resolution by the way but the end with Netflix app support standard definition only speaking of Netflix
Chromebook with every us ice stylus however at the moment the only one I was able to buy is the HP USI stylus that cost around $80
Chrome OS supports some special features for the stylus you can easily take screenshots and annotate them for instance but also cut out parts of the screen
you can use the stylus as a laser pointer and as a magnifying glass tool by tipping on the pen icon in the status bar
especially when considering how inexpensive it is because in Geekbench 4 for instance it's placed between the Samsung Galaxy Tab s 6 light and C Galaxy
Chrome browser performs much better than a dozen similar Windows tablets intensive web surfing is possible here but it always depends on what you're expecting
chrome does not perform as well as it does on a $1000 laptop that should be clear but for this price range
Android apps to note-taking apps YouTube and Adobe Lightroom 1 smoothly and just as they do on an Android tablet with PowerDirector
we're getting a desktop class browser at Aqaba with integrated kickstand a keyboard and a stylus option other aspect like good screen performance and battery life
if you're willing to spend a bit more money you can get a much better performance with the Apple iPad 7
you can get it with the keyboard and stylus as well and Safari performs great with web apps - a major highlight here
in case you mostly want to watch movies and videos you get a prettier screen and much better speakers with the Samsung Galaxy Tab
light is an interesting alternative - if you need the pen and want an Android tablet the S Pen is fantastic
Go - it's an interesting choice if you need to Windows apps and if you want a great pen at the same time including pen and keyboard
let's take a look at the specs and see if it's worth it and bankia was kind enough to send this tablet to me
it'll add its finishing touches and you're all logged in easy as that so here you can see no bloatware just Google Apps so which is awesome
on this tablet also reading books and also for e-books you can also select iComfort which is a mold built-in just to give you less eye fatigue
so if you do like the video you can please hit that like button and if you haven't subscribed you can please do that
i don't show it but on the other side of this box um it stores a whole bunch of pen nibs
so you've got loads of spare pendants in there and there's like a pen nip remover thingy in there as well
um and then this last box has the power cable in it like the three in one cable i believe um let me get out so there we go
the usb the uh pluggy thingy to go into the actual tablet and power it and connect it to your pc
both you can see me pointing at the instructions right here and yet i fail to follow them so you even see me hesitate
make sure that there's a matte finish left when you pull off and not a glossy one like what i just did
uh this is me comparing it to my 13 hd cintiq so you can see it's a little bigger and it looks very very fancy in comparison
it will download a zip so you just go ahead and download that and then unzip that and then you'll get the exe folder file
uh the monitor that your pen is working on so that you can use your tablet to reach stuff on your other monitor
it felt very natural to use all throughout um you can see in the videos in the corner me using it against the screen
this is before i got the screen protector where it was a little bit squeaky but since getting a replacement one it feels totally good
you can see you can set it up so that it's powered solely from the laptop which is awesome because this is primarily a portable tablet
now so the positives with this is that it just it felt great like it just felt like i was using my cintiq pretty much
um so it wasn't a huge deal but it happened maybe like three times over the course of what an hour and a half
i've only used this for a few weeks now but i've had no problems with it and it looks nice and it feels nice
USB 2 standard USB for transferring files you get because it's a 3G compatible you get these conversions or adapters saw this one
there you've got a rear camera on it double speakers there and if we just boot it up so this is the first time boots you know the reason
I'm in the shop so I'll have to connect it to the to the shop network as well is the standard
so so that's good for that and as you can see that's going to come up there just like any other Android device you've got your camera
I would suggest be workers previous ones that I do these because they have got a plastic screen and not a glass screen
I'm going to be unboxing it and telling you what I like about this tablet and when it dislike but I've got this tablet a Walmart
it's not heavy at all so it's good for reading e-books and you know just laying down in bed or holding it with one hand
from like $100 tablet in the back has like a plastic feel so it's not like a premium or anything near a premium
feel but that's what you get when you're just painting $100 for a tablet so let's go ahead and turn it on
so if you're looking for something fast and you're not patient you might consider getting a one-semester tablet with a better processor
I would consider getting something else as you guys can see while I'm browsing the web which is a very basic task
you're gonna get a pretty decent experience while watching movies or listen to music so it comes with an IPS HD display so
so it's really not convenient to have the camera right here because you're probably gonna be with your finger on the camera or something like that
so you guys can see can hear the audio quality and also see the quality of the camera itself so as I'm listening to the video
tab it's a 10 inch tablet goes for a hundred and twenty nine ninety five and inside of the tablet four specs
if you're a specs kind of person it does have a 10.1 inch IPS display and the resolution is 1280 by 800 so basically what that means is IPS
if you need it 64 should probably be enough with most people that end up buying this tablet 3 gigabytes of RAM which is not that bad Android 9.0
I'll talk about a second mini HDMI micro USB charging audio port and like I said micro SD checking out the back of the tablet
actually so you can plug in you know hard drive or something if you wanted to and it should recognize it again
which is a DC port which allow you to power it up and also this is where you're gonna put the micro SD card at the bottom
it's hard to find accessories for these cases for these tablets this actually comes with a case and I'll show this a little bit later
yep make sure you can't go any higher yep so 7 2016 be able to do for any video on here since
it wouldn't make sense for it to be able to do 1080p but it plays it absolutely fine you can see
this is my video as well when I had a vlog so you can see it starts up really really quick
so you hit the recent apps button press and hold on the window and ask you to drive to the left or to the right
I'll drag this one to the right so I've got my YouTube video and then I will load up a website here
which are probably the type of games that you might want to play on a tablet like this anyway which you know
can't you see how fast it loads up for this tablet you get this nice beautiful 10 inch display to to look at stories and the news on here
I installed which are subway surfer tag with Orion and that is pretty much it for you know just apps on here and I almost forgot
did not prepare for this video at all but it has to be done because there's absolutely no resource on this online and that pisses me the off
so there's like 50 construction sites around so there's this is already full of dust even though I've unpacked it 10 minutes ago
this vac formed plastic sheet super minimal instructions so this is really not geared at the Western market since everything is in little lines and squiggles
Apple started this whole thing with like showcasing this stuff then oneplus did it and they'll show me does it with everything
the coolest would have been like actually have it somehow integrate like samsung style or stuff but anyway keep in mind
i want to show you the the color shift of this is pretty interesting so it's pretty blue in most angles
but the downside of this right is that if you touch it right if you press it like you will have smudges literal smudges in the which
so show me media writing tablet this and this is the remarkable tablet so we'll probably even have to zoom out a bit
so yeah that's that's a total win in my book and yeah you have a few tools right so you have for example this would be the brush
it is pressure sensitive so you press like very little so based on speed right you have undo right and this
I do use a lot right these buttons you can use with your fingers writing obviously not so you can like hold it down and do stuff like that
I think would be the word right so one is black one pixels black one is white and it gets to this gray which is very believable like
X here that it can't upload it some stuff like it's it's not connecting to Wi-Fi for some reason so hmm so Wi-Fi is it connected
I want to make a duplicate of it and now I can move the duplicate but I can't move it to a different page which which is stupid
done like not a prototype but for first generation device someone who knew their was working on this right so to open it
it is extremely stiff right so and it fits the remarkable perfectly right as you would expect but again right all this stuff
I don't know pleasing the pen and this is why you need this right first of all if you scratch your plastic display like this crach is super easily
well those are even harder to find and Sony's latest tablet is bringing water and dust proof capabilities a super high-resolution display and PlayStation integration
but does it do enough to stand out amongst DC of Android tablets or does it simply just fall in line with the rest
well that's what we're about to find out with the Sony Xperia z4 tablet when picking up the z4 tablet for the first time
that are very inconspicuous to keep the front looking clean one of the main attractions of the z4 tablet is definitely the display
by any means but audio definitely does sound great on the z4 tablet and the audio enhancements can all be done automatically or if you're willing to go deeper
obviously we can't talk about hardware without talking about the front-facing speakers on the z4 tablet while you aren't able to take advantage of any of
Hardware includes typical connectivity like Bluetooth NFC Wi-Fi and LTE if you choose to go with the LTE enabled version there's 32 gigs of on-board storage
if you need more of course a sony product wouldn't be complete without being waterproof and dust tight with a rating of IP 65 and 68
the z4 tablet can handle the occasional splash and submersion for up to 30 minutes at one and a half meters but keep in mind
only inside of the z4 tablet is a large 6,000 milliamp hour battery to keep things running and battery life on the z4 has been quite impressive
I primarily only use tablets for playing games and watching videos so I suppose you could say I'm a heavy user
historically have never been great on tablets and I've always sort of felt like an afterthought especially when you compare them to cameras on smartphones
there's a bunch of novel shooting modes like face and picture sweet panorama multi camera and AR effect the usefulness of some of these features are questionable
quality however is exactly what you would expect from a tablet camera there are serviceable photos and should do the job
that means it's an external monitor that plugs into either your Mac or Windows computer and you can draw on it using the included pen little disclaimer
you got room for me in there too so as you probably guessed from the name it has a 13 inch display a 13.3
that's very similar to last year's canvas pro 13 but this is a different device in fact spec for speck it's almost identical
that's right this is not a touchscreen computer only the pen works on the screen not your fingers but those features would also drive up the price
display is striving to be an affordable drawing tool that makes some compromises but not compromises to the overall drawing experience and overall
I've always had this dream of making a game it's an AR game about a guy who only wears hot dog costumes and thanks to today's sponsor
I mentioned that these specs are pretty similar to last year's so this is a good time to run through those specs
the displays resolution is still only 1920 by 1080 that's full HD and the pen has 8,192 levels of pressure sensitivity and sixty degrees of tilt
lamination reduces the space between the glass and the screen below it making where your cursor appears much closer to where your pen tip actually hits the screen
okay let's talk about this pen last year's model had some wobble to the pen and I wasn't big fan of that but this year
I found that you do need to plug in the second one for this to work seamlessly it can get power from your laptop or you can plug that
USB cord into a power adapter you have laying around and use that instead so that three-in-one cable is the cable
I use for most of this review but I love the idea of being able to just use a USBC cable
it's just a lot cleaner and it also makes this thing you know somewhat portable easier to throw in a bag and take with you okay so
USBC cable from who Aeons website when you check out I already have a bunch of them so I decided I don't really need to do that
I jumped on who yawns website and I went looking to see if I could just buy the cable directly from them
I don't want to spend any more money on cable so I am going to Plan C sandpaper and yeah this Android
drawing with that feels great really smooth lines just a great experience at least as good as it can get on decks now
but partially if you don't have that touchscreen there's no way to zoom in and out or if you want to type on the screen
these problems aren't unique to the canvas 13 ran into the same exact ones when I was using the Wacom one
USBC cable so I would say that if you're just looking for a drawing tablet and you're totally cool with using the three-in-one cable which works really really well
the Lenovo tab and seven is one of very few 7-inch tablets so just a bit bigger than many smartphones at the same time
I'd ever say that about a SUP $100 tablet but in fact the body feels very high-end and it's much more premium feeling than the Amazon fire seven
the other features are typical for a cheap tablet instead of a USB support it's still being charged with a micro USB connector I like that
yes you will be able to see pixels but similar price competitors have the same low resolution and in the past
regarding any of those aspects of course but the screen is much better than the one of the tap is seven from last year
by the way you can't watch Netflix with HD resolution because the necessary DRM standards are not supported in this case
however that's not an issue because we're not getting an HD resolution anyways let's get to its hardware and performance inside city novo tab m7 once a mediatek
you will be able to choose between 1 to 2 gigabytes of RAM as well as between 8 kilobyte 16 gigabyte or 32 gigabyte of internal storage
I've noticed smaller legs most of the time and I often have to wait a bit until something is properly loaded
sure you can't expect too much of it's cheap tablet and if you use just one tap and Chrome to read the news
I've never had the feeling of using something fast sure you can surf the web a bit and watch some Netflix
all of that works but you will see smaller status quite often and if something is not immediately loading it can be frustrating
root as the lenovo tab m7 got a runtime of 10 hours with this result it's much better than its predecessor and a little above the Amazon fire 7
it's better life and display a very similar however it feels much cheaper due to its plastic body and instead of Google
but there are some new features that this one has that we will be covering in this review among other things now
I do want to let you know though in the interest of full disclosure that I paid for this with my own funds
and when you turn the device off and then back on again you will see an ad and you can easily just swipe it away and move on
but if you don't like the ads you can spend 95 bucks and get the same tablet without the ads on there
so this is what its gonna look like when you get it out of the box and start playing with it
I'm sure folks down in the comments will tell you how to do it or at least point you in that direction but generally
nothing spectacular on that front same as last year so not great image quality but it is a cheap tablet after all your power button is right here
and if you have that voice activation enabled that no doubt might take up some resources as well so just keep that in mind
this is probably not the tablet for you because Google and Amazon have been fighting with each other for years over YouTube on Amazon devices
I call it because it says youtube.com/ on it but it actually goes to the YouTube website and not to an official app
and you don't get very high quality video out of this so you'll notice that the videos will load up ok but the quality isn't quite there
you will not get on here and there's no way at the moment to easily install an official YouTube app on these Android tablets
this device is not a gaming powerhouse by any means but it can run a bulk of the games you'll find in the Amazon App Store
it'll be a little sluggish but not bad and another type of game that runs very well on here are retro games
and it's a pretty decent experience for a $79 tablet so not bad there one thing to note though is that
and what they're saying is that this will actually work exactly like the echo show does so we could for example say Amazon
show me my video flash briefing and now what it's going to do is pull up video content and display it on-screen here just like
would and all the things you can do with the show you can do here in fact you can even have it look at your security cameras
you've got the ability now to kind of use this thing as both a tablet but also an appliance that works like other perhaps more expensive
did just because it's got the same processor built in the same amount of memory but it's doing more but for $79
the two-year-old has the smaller version of the Amazon fire tablet here inside of the kids case and that thing is still in pristine condition
if you want to help the channel you can by contributing as little as a dollar a month head over to land
we're gonna be taking a look at the all-new Lenovo Chromebook duet and I've been super excited to get my hands on this
okay so the base price on the duet is two hundred and seventy nine ninety nine that's for the 64 gigabyte model
USB type-c now lenovo is calling this a chromebook and what you've seen so far is just the tablet portion of the whole unit
travel is great but this keyboard did take a little bit of time to get used to because the keys are so close together
but one of the downsides about adding all of these accessories to the tablet itself is as can see it makes it a bit thick so personally
the aspect ratio is actually 16 by 10 so no matter what when you're using Chrome OS if you're in landscape or portrait mode
and we'll be testing out a bunch in this video 802 dot 11 AC Wi-Fi so you can pick up that 5 gigahertz network Bluetooth 4.0 USB type-c
attached it's definitely on the thicker side of things when everything's attached but it does attach quite well on the back here
we're designed to use a keyboard and mouse so you might want to have your trackpad and keyboard ready so whenever
I think it comes in at 329 so it is a bit more expensive and it's strictly Android on the duet for single core
Geekbench 5 the scores on this definitely look low when you compare it to Geekbench 4 but over on the tab s6 light
we scored a 1000 105 and over on the tab s6 light we scored a 1547 and we also have Vulcan support
so when you're done with work in school or even during work in school you might want to view some videos using your favorite streaming app
I showed off some YouTube video playback through the Chrome browser but this is the Android app and there is one issue that I'm running into right now
I believe the duet does have enough power to play this game perfectly even on high settings they just really need to optimize this one next up we have
with the design and the performance of this little tablet given the price of 280 to $300 now I love the portability factor as the tablet
I think this is an awesome little deal here and so far in all actuality my only complaint here is the thickness when you have everything put together
little design and I can definitely recommend something like this if you're looking for a highly portable Chrome OS tablet or laptop
I would actually like to come back to this in a few days but I do want some input from users who really use Chrome OS
I'm gonna leave a few links in the description in case you want to learn more about the duet but like always
I'm mark a professional artist and our teacher and in today's video we'll be reviewing this new tablet by XP pen
if you're in the market for a display tablet like this thing here check it out all right so as I said this tablet here
so we'll see here just how much more you get for your money if you decide to get this model instead but first of all of course
then we have the standard plastic stand for the tablet which is exactly the same as the one for the artist
so you can use either pen for either tablets now if we take a look at the actual tablet here the main difference that
of course you can always swap it out to a brand new one but I don't want to have to do that
so that film wouldn't be required and then when it comes to the rest of the stats for the display panel very very similar across the board
here we can compare the two side-by-side the main thing that you'll notice is really just the height that's different when it comes to the width of the tablet
all of this is good to know but what really matters is how this thing feels when you're actually painting on it or sculpting in 3d
you know with the initial activation of the pen tip if you don't press hard enough sometimes your brush stroke won't get registered or you know if
you know hoping that they fix in the future because it is a defect in the device or maybe it's just a pen
then yeah that made more sense but all of that said though the experience the painting experience here is very very nice
that's outside of these circles is not good everything that's towards the center of the chart is good and basically as long as a tablet is within any circle
I split it in three different three different things I feel are the most important to me at least and probably to most people
I only have two tablets outside of the circle as you can see the iPad and the artist 22 pro by XP Pen the main reason for example
outside of the circle is because it uses older tech where you need to charge your pens and so it's happened to me a number of times where
I placed it only in the tablet quality circle because it's equality device great resolution and great colors not very affordable
I don't have anything here yet but that would be the perfect tablet not too expensive the best technology without any issues
I was expecting a little bit more but as I said at the beginning $50 difference is not a big deal
we'll see what happens in the future with new tablet releases and I hope this review this short review was helpful in helping you
let me know if the initial pen activation issue is an issue at all for you or if there's anything else that
my surface pro doesn't have one of the things here on the back if I flip this down first of all not just this little red dot there
that's when it's powered on all right we've got a SIM card slot here as well as a micro SD card the Nano slim sim on there
because you've got the weight of that so it's pretty good for that sort of lap usage and then you've got this nice keyboard that travels
I used to have those on laptops years ago and got used to them and then now I've got you so trap
PowerPoint personal office stuff or doing photo editing that Photoshop kind of stuff so plenty of power in the device for that which and which is
it makes the device very hot depending on the you know on certain devices because it's using the graphics so here is it using running
there's new notepad or sticky notes and things like that that are interactive and this pen will come in very handy there so just like the surface
I do like taking notes on the surface with the pen so make sure the screen as well looking at that
it's more of a laptop then a convertible this is a true tablet like the surface pro range and this unique design
take your time so you can get the most out of your new tablet connect to the Internet and let it download all the updates
this tablet is perfect for just simply going on the internet checking your email and going on your favorite sites it comes of Google Chrome pre-installed
subscribe button as well as the bail notification if you want to continue making those informed purchase decisions because in the end it's your money right
it would be hard to notice the difference the feedback that we got from some of our graphic artist friends as well as some other reviewers suggests that
the tablet also includes a micro SD card reader along with an 8 gig class 10 card that stores the driver but can also be used as expandable storage
Pens cable the tablet works with both Windows and Mac OS across a variety of apps which we will list down in the description below
the tablet was quick and easy but unlike some other models the shortcut buttons on the tablet itself do you not have icons that indicate its function
I can see this being a nuisance when trying to erase large portions of a drawing as the latency is a little bit noticeable
I don't also like how there is no battery indicator on the pen there is an LED light in between the buttons
when you are ready to draw you can just place the pen directly on the tablet and start sketching away the big question
we will invest in better equipment but right now what we have is perfectly fine to get us noticed in the game
it is a tablet that will grow with you as you do develop your artistic talents with a price tag of $80
Twitter and Instagram in the links down below we have also provided an affiliate link down below to the Hugh ion tablet
this feels like a nice sturdy metal tablet with a soft touch back on it very light at one point two three pounds on this
SD card goes pretty well sealed since it's supposed to be a bit wind and moisture resistance on micro SD card slot and here
Android again we got a couple of shortcuts to managing things like our brightness our Wi-Fi notifications and that's about it
I like it as I mentioned quite sturdy feeling it can do everything expect from an Android tablet you can read eBooks on it though
so not the longest-lived nor the shortest-lived tablet on the market again that it kind of puts it in a mid-range e position it is however impressive
that's probably not the best thing they can use a better suite of applications to get them started with social networking obviously viewing office documents
eight plus hours of uptime is claimed for the tablet itself 14 plus hours of uptime claimed for the tablet and dock combination together and
top side of the tablet power button as well as a very small reset pin hole right there and on the left edge
Asus does include this USB dongle that you plug into the sink and charge port on the bottom of the device which allows USB connectivity to the tablet
alright so let's give you a quick sense of boot time we'll go ahead and hit the power button here on the to devote a party
Android slate based on the same platform actually the same Tegra 3 chip for example in the Asus Transformer Prime series of ten inch slates
it is touch-centric it is tiled based and if you don't know a few basic gestures and commands you will have a little bit of a learning curve
let's show you we swipe in from the right here and we bring up the charms toolbar as well as the clock and calendar
primary portion is the foreground running app and we can cycle through apps in the foreground while that shared tile secondary app is running in the background
of course you've got scrolling and two-finger scrolling for left and right and up and down and as you can see very responsive and also reorientation is very responsive
it's it's actually a very efficient and as you'll see we'll switch to desktop mode here and also with this tablet by the way
and then we've got the task manager here and you can see also we've got a bunch of apps running we've got the
and if we just swipe in they come to the foreground activate and begin to consume resources but until then they're idle and in a sleep
nice water reflections a little bit of geometry there with some flying debris and as you can see very fluid good frame rates
a little bit on the pricey side to be honest but but not too bad and impressive graphics again for tablet based gaming and this has been a quick
I have the incredible honor of reviewing a new huion graphic tablet and you'll also see a speedpaint for a be more chill piece with said tablet recently
the huion tablet worked very harmoniously with my program but either way it gave me some more inspiration and motivation to draw with it
I will say something that I didn't expect to love almost just as much as how it felt to draw with
it's still very close to the feeling of drawing on paper if you're interested in getting it it's only $79.99 on the huion online store
which in my opinion for a graphic tablet is pretty much a steal as always thanks for watch and if you enjoy the speed paint or the art
I highly suggest you check it out on my Instagram at its Cosmo or I'll have the final finished version of the piece that I did
there's a lot of people who start out with these kind of tablets which is great like these are very affordable right now
which i think is a pretty fair price considering if a 10 by 6 drawing this like drawing area and it comes with a lot of buttons
I believe over here it does you yeah comes with 12 buttons and you can see them are all right here so you got a couple rows of these
oh also on the back of this thing you'll notice there's a nice little rubber pads to keep it from sliding on your on your desk surface
it's a different set of commands if you open up code studio it's different set of commands if you open up
so it's much easier to go to the website you get fresh drivers so you don't worry about driver issues or anything like that but anyway now
that it's really hard for me to go back to these but I will say this is a really nice feeling tablet
I didn't have that many issues and I'm sure if I drew with this every day I would be able to give right back into them
you'd like to see me drawing next or any tutorials or anything like that but anyway let's keep that discussion going
real quality for this is quite solid it has a good weight to it and the rubber feed prevents it from moving around on the table
this is a big piece of rubber grip and on the back there is nothing no you raise there and no charging pot so this pen
when you're going on in the big quality feels very solid and this tablet has a very nice weight to it
Windows so this is where you can customize the physical shortcut buttons you can customize the wheel there are three sets of shortcuts
if you are a left-handed user this is where you can change the rotate settings 280° so that physical shortcut buttons
so from a thin to thick the transition it's very smooth and also the line is the taper very nicely very gradually the pen
I'm changing the size of the cursor using the control wheel so now I have their cursor vertical and now it's horizontal
so here i am using the wireless USB receiver connected to the adapter to use it with my phone that has USB C connection
it's going to map this vertical portion of the tablet to the phone so this tablet is said to work with Android 9
Android phone which is also running on android 9 and with my samsung tablet which is also on android 9 out of the three devices
even though the operating system for all the three devices are the same so here it has pressure sensitivity and it's very responsive there is no lag at all
I wasn't able to get the two looking right and also when you are using this tablet with Android the shortcut buttons
Android with this tablet but I'm not sure if I can recommend getting these tablet just for drawing on Android notice what happened just now
I have to connect the cable to the adapter to get it to get a phone to recognize the tablet first
I'm so like that this is Wireless and you don't have to charge pens so you don't deal with any of the cable clutter
I'm not sure how long the battery life will last but anyway I should last probably for several weeks and you can still use it while you are charging
I will put the link to my tax review in the video description below when I have finished writing that review
you are using whether or not the company has done any tweaks to the Android system and which device you are using
well sometimes the cursor will not appear so if you are thinking of getting this tablet to work with your Android device
happy 7 is a simple barre tablet it features the full plastic body and you can get it and black only when holding it
you can feel that it is a cheaper tablet however it seems to be bird solid enough and shouldn't break easily with over ten millimeters
SD card slot that one has hidden behind the blue lid on the top it features a standard headphone jack and a micro USB port
but don't expect a great sound here at all there's no bass at all and the sound can be flat and even a bit scratchy
the quality is pretty bad even in good light well but they do work so you can make some snapshots or so in this price range
another weak point is the display of silly no but happy 7 it has a diagonal of 7 inches and a pretty low resolution of just 1024 by 600
it is bright enough to use inside and the touchscreen works just as it should in certainly no vote happy 7 sets immediate act
my review unit is the cheapest one was Wi-Fi and 8 gigabyte of storage out of the box just over three gigabytes are used by the system
the hardware is pretty weak and that is what benchmarks show - in Geekbench 4 and then - 2 Z Lenovo Tepe 7 gets very low results
go and it's go ab spa that the operating system chrome jim ago and youtube go run smoothly in the past
the game doesn't look that awesome anyways so its performance is not really good but it is fine if you don't have high expectations
it is one of the first tablets to run and what goal that is a simpler less demanding version of Android aimed at weaker hardware
you can adjust it a bit in the settings but it doesn't look great when using it in landscape view it is even worse with the bigger
it can be a bit annoying that you always have to select C playback quality before watching a video but well and what go in this tablet
and if you're planning to get this tablet just keep in mind you have to charge it daily at least if you're using it a lot
the performance of the tapi 7 is good enough for most things including surfing the web for watching YouTube and even to play simple games
its main downside is the seven-inch screen though the lower solution is not that big of a deal but as as aspects are not good
it is important that the performance is good enough for simpler tasks that is not always the case but here it is so
if you don't want to spend more you cannot get a better tablet for the same price at least not right now
I think the best next tablet and the one you should probably get as an alternative is the Amazon Fire HD 8
depending on the market it costs around $80 only and offers much better performance a much better screen and a much longer battery life
the only thing missing was a pen holder which some people would find a necessity however it compensates by providing a stylish pouch to store the pen
which you can find on the tangka card and I'm going to install it so be right back and through the magic of video
moving on mapping allows the drawing surface to be mapped to only one monitor or even just an area of the monitor
it was just switching the mapping so pretty good under function you can customize the 12 buttons on the tablet itself to any function or shortcut you'd like
this is about one and a half times larger than my older tablet so it would take some time adjusting to it
so that the keys are to your right and in the drivers you can set up a left hand mode which is the first time
I'm not sure how long they're gonna last but with good care this tablet would last you a very long time
buttons as well and since one of the default mappings is to a right-click which corresponds to the eyedropper tool here
I'd say I like the simple look and the fact that it could adapt to both left hand and right hand users
I would say this is the only category that I am certain that the score is max points 5 out of 5 in the value for money
if you're looking for something to start with and you would want some extra drawing surface plus a lot of buttons yeah
I'm giving just before hitting 1000 subscribers which is coming in soon so if you have any suggestions on what special thing we should do
if you want to join and send me some fan art the link is going to be below and I am going to drop off now
this was loving peace tunes reviewing the VK 15 graphics tablet next video will be animation so stay tuned until next time Cheers
I'm back again with another video and today I'm sharing with you this 8-inch NuVision tablet running full Windows 10 on it with the anniversary update that I installed
I got this from the Microsoft Store one year and four months ago this was listed for $129 but was on sale for $99 with tax included
so inside this 8-inch body rest and into Adam quad-core processor clocked at one point thirty two gigahertz and in toast burst technology
this lasts me about 4 hours of continuous moderate usage and 6 hours and 30 minutes on power saver airplane mode with some standby and yes
that is if you have your onedrive synced up on it so you can sync your files across every device so you can work on it here
does it right away considering what you're paying here 110 dollars for two gigs of RAM and 32 gigabyte of storage with an outstanding display with Christmas
so I think the pros on this overweight the cons thrown in that it goes only for 110 or $90 on Amazon
Windows 10 tablet thank you for watching and I will catch you on the next one have a Merry Christmas you
I actually like the size a little bit better than this this Amazon one so it's probably about the same thickness but you can see
what up to turn first everybody and then here is the Vanco and it's just a little wider a little more ipad ish right and I will say too
I think it's a little lighter which might be like the plastic construction which is good but for a $99 tablet
you there for charging looks like the volume rocker right here and I think this is the power button and it looks like
it looks like alright so a part of this sucker up and then let's try it out and as it's powering up here
hi there hello so looks like it's just gonna walk me through a little bit of startup and there we go
this is not a CD but just a card on which the website is mentioned to download the driver and this is P 4 NT card
this is the pen all dirt which you can place on the table like this and it also has extra nibs
okay so it perfectly fits in the bag and the pen can also be kept in the bag now lettest of all
you can purchase it directly from there the official link so as you can see there is no lag and pressures and trivet is really nice
basically this is a city display and it has ePaper technology you can draw on it like this and simply plastic
Lightner last week we had a chance to test the you draw graphics tablet from THQ over at the media tech
and i have to admit i was quite surprised at the results that the kids were able to achieve with it
it has things like charcoal and you can layer and so on all in all you'll be surprised at what this thing can do
hi guys it's me journyx in this video let's see the unboxing and the oral impression of the Alcatel a3 10.1
okay now I will show you the inside box control at first there is in screen guard is included with the box
now let's check out this sound quality and the audio and the songbird is pretty cool and the speaker is stunning now
I'm gonna get one on the front so if you want to do like video calls or take photos and videos you can
I've seen as well so this is one of my videos playing if it looks a little washed out on the screen
you can see it doesn't it's just there's no volume really and the clarity is just not there and then as for performance
I mean if there's a website that has a lot of ads it might take a bit to load that up but other than that
it's gonna be completely fun doing that stuff on here and then as for gaming you can definitely game on this
it's gonna do a fine job with you shouldn't have any issues with like gaming on this or word games or anything like that
these are some photos that I took with the front in the back camera this one I took with the back camera
I would say 4 to 5 hours of battery life based off what you're gonna do because you're gonna watch videos most likely you're gonna browse the web
I would count you closer to lower to the you know 5 hours 4 hours of battery life on this as for the software it's Android 8.1
I'm always in the lookout for something even better so my search landed me on the Lenovo ThinkPad x1 tablet 3rd gen now
I didn't get a chance to review it when it got released mid last year but I'm glad I got a chance to check it out recently
packaging is once again very premium as we've come to expect with the ThinkPad line opening the lid you're greeted by the unit itself
you get with the type cover for the surface pro six but this is a legendary thing pad keyboard with the track point on it
holding the unit for the first time this thing is built like a tank premium all the way construction is first-rate
go calm for these great savings and remember to use my discount codes and tell them andrew sent you now to me
so if you're using it with the pan taking notes you will need a place to hold the tablet so hence those bezels now
sensitivity may thought that the palm rejection worked well a great implementation great for taking notes great for sketching out artwork
Bend we saw with the surface pro 6 now unlike the surface pro 6 we could magnetically attach the pen to the side of the unit
but this doesn't have that option instead they give you a plastic pen holder and it's not the greatest solution to be honest however
I think the typing experience is just that much better and I'm not surprised as Lenovo and the ThinkPad line make some excellent keyboards
it does fast charge though so if you do plugin it takes a little bit under two hours to get a full charge
they're usually terrible for the most part on the two ones we've seen in the past but this actually isn't too bad but again
usually we see really terrible cameras on these two-in-ones tablets this is actually pretty good and I thought the photos actually weren't too bad either so check it out
when you're in landscape mode it worked well setup was pretty easy and it registered my finger pretty much every time
I used it now when it comes to the audio I wasn't impressed in fact I was a little bit disappointed
so you can plug in your wired headphones which would do a lot better now despite having a larger display than the surface pro 6
it's thin and light and it's easy to carry around with you say you're a business executive going to a board meeting or a student going to a classroom
you get some weak audio and I'm not crazy about that pen slot and this can get pretty pricey but to me
I absolutely love it and I love the fact they include the track point one of my favorite pointing devices of all the time
its durability through all the different elements as well as taking a lot of abuse and it really can do that
so if you're the business user or the student it was really hard on their devices this is a two and one for you
those are the two things you need to buy separately with the surface pro 6 making that a very expensive proposition but I'm curious to know what you think
because i'll probably say it wrong so i will just stick it on the screen now and you can decide how to pronounce it yourself
so operating system is android a screen size of 8 inches it has ram of 3 gigabytes and of storage of 32 gigabytes and quad core
they've tested this first before it's released to make sure it's safe for you to use so it says on the internet
in addition to the gms test suites also performs various security related tests to verify that the user's data on the device is secure or not
i'm going to go and get my knife and i'm going to cut it all open and see what you get for your money
so that should go in your razor connections or if you've got a smart plug like me it'll go in there and oh comes with headphones
yeah if it's in the screen mode sound like that google play protect is turned on this feature protects your drop device from harm okay
okay just wipe it up so this has bluetooth as well as wi-fi and the reason you might want bluetooth is let me move
i couldn't wait any longer storage 10 news so we've got 28.75 gigabytes left display blah blah blah and usual stuff and that'd be money in the background
let's have a look at the camera itself so like i said there should be two cameras allow camera to actually fasten out all the time
so what do i think then for the amount of money you pay 83 pound a man that sort of price
and i believe that might be reset button and yeah only as mono speaker definitely gets my thumbs up for the amount of money you pay
now this was recently released alongside another tablet the tab m8 HD and hopefully I can get my hands on that soon
and this in my opinion is the perfect form factor for a 7-inch tablet so over here on the right hand side
I still think they're kind of lacking on the specs here this is known as the Lenovo Tab m7 for the CPU we have a quad-core 1.3
but I still look at this as quite odd seeing that it's 2019 and companies are still releasing Android devices with only one gigabyte of RAM
you don't have to do any modifications to get that so you can download your favorite apps but keep in mind
you can go into the settings and mess around the base and travel and get it to sound decent but overall sound on
we scored a 432 multi 1168 very low in on the scale and when we compare this to the 2019 fire seven
they're not as terrible as I thought but they could be much better if they had it built an AC chip
I had to lower every video setting in the game itself to get it to run this good and as you can see the rendering distance isn't great
this is actually pretty odd because Minecraft Pocket Edition is very well optimised and it works on a lot of lower end devices quite well
I do have the FPS listed and it seems to be running fairly well on the m7 and for my final test
I would personally go with the Amazon Fire HD now as for the form factor and layout I really do like the way this tablet is designed
I just wish it had more power if the company would come out with something like this with this same form factor and a more powerful chip
definitely keep an eye on the channel because I have the other new Lenovo Tab m8 coming in and it does have a quad core 2 gigahertz CPU now
I suggest you skip this one and if you still need a really cheap Android tablet I would go with the Amazon fire 7 the 2019 version
Black Friday very soon and I'll leave some links in the description but that's pretty much it for this video guys
this is the frozen two themed version from disney of course uh parental controls 500 plus games and no in-app purchases
of course it has a speaker front and rear camera so they can take pictures of themselves and multi-touch as well look at the back
and what sort of things your little boy or girl has been playing and how long for seven days 30 days or all time
so if they've been playing games reading books watching videos i guess or do some educational processes because this tablet contains everything the rules
that's how many books it has in this one and if you go to another one let's go to young classic readers
play games including some really cool ones like real retro games which i gotta admit is something i would probably play and pac-man rally cart
if you have a little girl during the night when you're going to sleep in your bed definitely i would definitely recommend that other than that though
this single din chassis is gonna fit in many car dash openings and connects to an expansive nine-inch touchscreen display in the back
right after this you will be welcomed by pioneer's new smart ui which provides real-time information such as weather and sports
and now it's easier than ever to set your favorite features handy just by pressing and holding the icons exactly the same you do on your smartphone
you can replace the date with things such as sports phone camera views vehicle information climate control parking assist and radar
if we go to the dimmer we can manually adjust it or have it set on automatic because this unit has a light sensor built in the picture
you have the options to choose from a preset wallpapers or even upload your own also you have five teams to choose from with different color
all over the menu illumination will let you set any color for your buttons that way you can match it to your dash lights
have this option and the home custom setting is just gonna take us back to the home screen that we already done that before
uh you know the different kind of pencils and fine liners and brushes you got they all have different thickness settings
let's go ahead and switch over to talking about some of the software features now so this uh runs a linux based software
tilt you get kind of the shading effect the harder you press the darker the line is you got the different uh thickness options three different thickness options
um you know writing utensils have different pressure sensitivity like the uh paintbrush is fairly sensitive to it like the flat
pdfs as well like i said this device it also doubles as an e-reader with a pdf and e-pub support though drm-free epubs
you can also go in and view this as a list view if you don't want to view the cover view it's a little bit more condensed
you've also got the search function up here so if you wanted to search through your documents you can do that as well
here's the full list right here as of this review so it's got this accessibility option as well where you can increase the text size across the interface
so let's move on to talk about some of the ebook functions now so the remarkable it's primarily a note taking device
you can change the font size so if you have some made some edits on the screen if you wrote on there use some highlights
it takes out the pictures and ads and all that stuff and then it just looks like a regular text document you can also send as pdf as well
so you've got the multi-page view when you're using ebooks and pdfs and you can enter page numbers to go to
it's all same sort of deal in the uh when you're using pdfs as far as the note-taking option goes so you got a couple of different options
you can kind of drag the visible area the box for the visible area and then you can increase your zoom modes here
i know a lot of people like to compare ipads with these type of devices but to me it's just a completely different experience
i could never understand why people like writing on the ipad so loud and clinky and unnatural writing on the glass screen
I've got the Galileo probe that's possibly the biggest two-on-one tablet you can pick up for $100 my first impressions on the screen
it was good to watch videos on with a few people around since it is a big screen the large screen and low resolution is
screen is really noticeable when taking the tablet off the keyboard speaking of which the 5 pin magnets and two bumpers make the latch
the keyboard feels like the size of a regular laptop which makes typing a breeze and the shortcut buttons on top are pretty useful to have
just a few stutters here and there with the ante 2 benchmarks it gets a decent score usually at 25000 playing some games
such as fruit ninja and minecraft and with this immense eleven point five inch display makes the experience all that more enjoyable
the good thing is that you'll be able to download many games without a concern for storage space since there's 25 gigs available on this tablet
you can expect to get around 5 to 6 hours of on-screen time that lasted two days for me at school
the bullet is connected to my laptop via the HDMI cable and the pen is connected via the USB which goes into the back of the monitor
there many is easy to navigate so you can adjust various settings such as the brightness and the sizes of the guest screen to your liking
here are my general opinions on a monitor with footage of some of my paintings and sketches initially done with it
I wanted to go back onto my tablet or the tablet be easy to use so I definitely using this for the foreseeable future
I can compare the software and so far the UN has no bugs or lags unlike science in fact to replace or uninstall or reinstall
I have the problems I've encountered which are a few can easily be worked around as a monitor and not a tablet
I have to Hue on so if you do want to have a human one at home awake in tablet throwing you away from home or vice versa
is it easier as the buttons can be used for other things like a color picker and if it were possible
as he went on to suggest as good this monitors counterpart is the Wacom Cintiq and it's almost 650 pounds and human and human is probably around 402 pounds
I haven't tried it with kids to do a pain but I'd see no reason why I wouldn't work with it
so if you're looking for the technical information and info and buying the tablet please read the description below and finalized
I hope that your company gets a lot of business as this market really is worth it and it's top quality
t-mobile always has some sort of promotion running and last summer the lg g pad 5 promo enticed me to procure one of the devices
shout out to mason's downtown brooklyn all right aside from the massive shaking 1080p resolution at 30 frames per second in the low light situation
now at the bottom of the g-pad 5 you have a usb type-c port and two speakers with some decent volume all right
if you are looking for an oled experience you're not going to get that from this tablet but hold up plus to me
it wouldn't be fair to compare this device to an oled panel but you will enjoy checking out your videos your movies
revisit i have taken up enough of your time and if i was able to plug you into some useful information please leave a like
Fox cat and I've been given the opportunity to review an exciting device being brought to you by our supporting vendor gear vest so today for your viewing pleasure
LCD display coming in at 2048 x 1536 pixels or 264 pixels per square inch this display screen manufactured by LG is the exact same beautiful
Wi-Fi and I'm connected to Wi-Fi since my local service verizon does not provide wcdma or gsm and yes of course
of course first you'll see there's no button on the bottom like there would be on the iPad air so other than the 2 megapixel front-facing camera
I wonder if it'll support an even larger one but I'm still pleased to see it nonetheless then to the right of that is the sim card
so this gives you video out via wire on the right side of the tablet nothing else to report and finally if we look across the top
antennas are all stored up in here in this plastic area and they have obviously the ability to communicate that way
this is obviously a very large battery and obviously it needs it because it's a large screen so we have a pretty powerful charger and any other cable
I'm going to back out of here and I'm going to go to the main part of the gallery as you can see
ok turn it back to landscape mode we get our buttons back and we go back to home since this is android 4.4
what this device is priced at on the gear best site and really not get much more if any for your money
they've made two very nice additions to their store by opening remote warehouses both here and in Europe making deliveries of many of their devices custom
even besides this one device that might appeal to you folks thanks for watching thanks for being a valued member of droidforums net and
this tablet can output the color on the TFT screen looks best whenever you're sitting directly in front of the screen
the size of the screen in relation to the resolution makes for a slightly pixely lower individual most tablets nowadays are HD or at least 720p
after or even during working on a display tablet that doesn't have professional color correction the screen is also very glossy reflective and smooth
the buttons will light up red while charging they will shine blue until the pen is fully charged in which the lights turn off
I've charged them both as I have yet to need to recharge either one of them so I mostly tested on the latest version
it's hindered by the lack of an HD screen though the farther you zoomed out the more pixelated things get since the tablet doesn't have any Express keys
and you’ll find a pair of 1 megapixel cameras capable of 720p video front and back which are very average for a tablet.
The USB port is interesting as you can plug an absurd amount of stuff into the Surface which I demoed in a recent video.
It works well when you’re using the Surface at a desk but without being able to adjust it can be awkward to use much of the time.
About the only time you run into slowdowns is when the RAM is filled up which isn’t too hard to do with four or five Internet Explorer tabs
Tegra 3 pales in comparison to a Core i3 laptop which makes a huge difference with heavy lifting like gaming and photo and video editing.
That’s the thing, throw in the magnetic Type Cover and that’s basically what you have here: a tablet doing it’s best to be a laptop.
You’ll find Flash support in the browser and Office built in along with the traditional desktop but then you’ll realize that app support is starting from zero and Windows
and it's number one and top one on the list aggressive on top and collagen tablets so we are talking tablets and still made in japan
research research guys when it comes to language and it only focuses on glowing skin so skin elasticity and i know focus
fine lines and age spots helps strengthen over sensitive skin and heal and acne dryness and flaky skin vitamin b5 pantothenic acid encourages
stay tuned we'll start this review by taking a look at the overall ergonomics and the physical design of this product
the landscape or width of the product is 10.75 inches and the height of the product is 7 inches in terms of the thickness or the depth
textured finish which makes it a lot easier to grip and a lot less resistance to fingerprints as well too overall
right of the device is a great standard sd card slot which is capable of expanding the tablet's memory to up to 128 gigabytes on the left
everything runs really snappily the response of the touchscreen and the overall web browsing experience is fairly quick as well too
when you're watching flash video it does become a little jittery and even though the connection of the video has buffered and everything is good
one of the best parts of this tablet in my opinion is the fact that it has that array of ports at the side of the device
uh or if you want to watch movies with other people and thanks to its tegra 2 processor and the fact that it has sd and thumb drive capabilities
if you love using a keyboard and mouse in terms of browsing the internet thanks to android it has a capability of you can actually use a mouse
cursor use different keyboard shortcuts to make the overall computing experience a lot more enjoyable and a lot more serious than other tablets
and when you're done with all that you can just take out the usb and use it as a regular touchscreen device
it is a little bit heavier than most of those tablets out there and it is thicker as well too so in terms of physical dimensions
once you start slimming down the size and how to manage heat in a very innovative way is going to be a real test of time
then you should be seeing a great increase in battery life and also the heat will also decrease alongside with all those factors another downside towards this device
and we're going to keep doing the best we can and improving our quality improving our content as much as possible
I did on one of those tablets and I'm going to get into some really interesting stuff about this tablet that a lot of these reviews you watch online
though for people who are into art and that type of thing you also get an icon color effects which are an extension for a W Photoshop Elements
this is called their switch 12 and I thought this is going to be like their switch 10 which I like which is a low-cost computer
it's a hybrid tablet laptop and it doesn't really accomplish either of those functions very well it is rather big and bulky as you can see
we have it propped up on the desk here and there's no keyboard but the keyboard actually lives in the back of the computer now
you can't unfortunately flip the screen around that would be ideal because you would get a pretty easy way to flip back and forth
if you want to get a little bit more distance maybe get a little bit more of a resting spot for your wrist
the other issue with the keyboard is that this is a wireless keyboard even when it is docked it is in Wireless mode and consumes an onboard battery
so there's a battery on the keyboard in addition to the computer it doesn't charge when you have it docked which
it will charge the keyboard though when the computer is off and it will charge off of the laptops battery although that's not a huge power drain
let's take a look at its web browsing prowess first we've got Google Chrome loaded up here all this pop open to a story here and you can see
that's better designed mostly as a laptop and then if you really want a tablet there are some great like 8-inch
just going over the stuff that you'll get on this tablet if you don't game kind of proving that it's a good tablet even without those awesome features
shield tablet is made by Nvidia and besides all the awesome accessories it works with and all the other cool gaming tricks it has it
Nvidia's latest and greatest k1 chip inside so a 2.2 gigahertz quad-core processor 192 core GPU 2 gigabytes of RAM 16 gigs of storage
USB and HDMI on one side with a speaker port and the other speaker port on the other side and speaking of speakers yes
it has this really detailed precise watercolor effect if you choose to use that brush a whole bunch of different brush effects
I mean I felt like I can mess with this thing all day until I legitimately create works of art like this alright
I'm kidding that one came pre-loaded but this stylus recognition is definitely advanced as anything you'll find on any you know iPad or any other tablet
we've all been dreaming about you know even if that doesn't happen this will always be an option and it's a pretty good one props
flash has a better tuned and delicious if anything delicious would have the better tune but four hundred and seventy five dollars more
keep in mind that this is a version one and the current one is the version two but the way that they operate is almost exactly identical
I do like I'm gonna go ahead and move on to all the things that I don't like about it first off
I just really don't like the way this tablet feels the touchscreen is plasticky and it doesn't always respond and the outer
I know it's just a nitpicky thing but it just looks really cheap and I feel if you spent five hundred dollars on something
now that's just to set up your tablet now in order to get the actual tune files itself in order to actually tune your car
you have to search for your specific tune file that works for your ECU code the entire thing is just a nightmare
flash tablet the open flash manager and all the other software that you need the entire process everything feels like until 2005
I just wouldn't buy it new the stepping away from the actual physical tablet itself the tune from open flash works paired with an aftermarket header
new is because the use market for these things is so incredible there are two versions of the open flash tablet
2 but the only difference between the version 2 and version 1 is the hardware version 2 has better hardware and is faster than this one
one brand new is that you can save up $200 for the exact same thing the only difference between this version 1 and a version two
it also comes with a battery free pen along with eight replacement nibs a two finger glove and an instruction booklet
it only works with android though not iphone and of course it works with a computer or a laptop which is what i use
you can choose to get an extra pen extra nibs and an extra one or two figure glove for free by clicking which one you want
because they're easy to lose on top of the free accessory the m106k pro is also 15 off until november 15th
so if you think this is the tablet for you now's the time to go get it anyway for this video
you want to sketch out the keyframes of the entire action first and then go into detail if you lay it out
well in the beginning you'll be less likely to run into problems later on and your animation will look better as a whole start with your basic shapes
especially if you're bad at color theory like i am all you got to do is scribble those colors in until you're happy with them
now you're going to add a new layer and sketch out the keyframes and add more in-between frames to make it smoother remember
i'm reviewing it took me a little longer to get this tablet all set up and figure out all the buttons but once i did it worked great
that are used in shortcuts such as control or shift and then you can set your soft keys to common letters that are used in shortcuts
you're going to have to learn some to get the most out of all the shortcut options this tablet gives you
i recommend writing down your shortcuts on some sticky notes and putting them somewhere that you can see them while you're drawing until you memorize them
i'm just going to show you the box because um i think they've gone to quite a lot of effort with the box
doesn't really help with it but it's a really nice box and they've gone to quite a lot of effort with the box in the packaging
there's lots of um accessories included so you get a little pot for your uh for your pen and inside the pot
you can put whatever letter you want and then you can call it whatever you want as well and so i've got
i've only got a few buttons organized for this program but let's just okay that and then go over here so i've already got some
so let's see if i can quickly draw um a little cartoon oops little cartoon character so i'll just press the undo button there and undoes it straight away
let's get green which is kind of pick out that one and then we'll do there and there whoops okay so we've got a gap
okay so let's have a quick look at the other side on the underside so we just flip it over like this
and um if you're interested in getting one of these i'll let the i'll put it in the description down below so then you can have a look
hey guys and welcome to another episode of quick expert reviews today we've got the Vanco matrix pad s10 another funky
it would be nice if it would come pre-installed on the tab itself but yeah then we've got the kind of Samsung looking adapter
so it's nice that the power button is distinguished by this different pattern and texture on the on the top so you know what you are pressing
the device itself is running on Android 9 and it is supported by 2 gigabytes of RAM and 32 gigabytes of internal storage
if you'd like to when it comes to updates the light test update security update is from May 2018 and so pretty much made 2018
so we've got a back middle home and far-right reasons as well but we can rearrange that if needed schedule power on and off
we've got the read mode which removes the blue hue from the screen so puts less strain on our eyes when you try to read
so all you have to do is go into bluetooth pen your device and then pair your Bluetooth keyboard any Bluetooth keyboard any Bluetooth
nice now because the device also sports a type-c connector if you've got a wired mouse all you need is a type
you can connect a wired mouse or a wired keyboard as well so pretty neat considering the tablet itself is like what's 89 pounds now on
now we've got a left-click you've got a right-click if we can scroll as well and like I did mention you can use word for example
so yeah that's pretty much it when it comes to bluetooth mouse and keyboard so let's actually listen to the because the audio quality one last thing
the only disadvantage is that it doesn't support any form of fast charging so it takes around 4 hours to fully charge apart from that it lasts day
I had a chance to spend several weeks with it and this is what I found but before we get to that

full-screen visuals also wasn't working so I was looking forward to seeing if things had changed when I started to use the Alexa voice request
I reached out to a contacted Amazon to double-check on these functions and guess what they're still not enabled in Canada
there's a slightly noticeable improvement and having the widescreen format does give you more video to fill your field of vision with
if you're using this as a travel tablet or a commuter device you'll definitely be able to enjoy all your favorite videos easily
I'd say if you're getting this tablet for a kid or young teen save the money and just pick up the eight if you need it yourself
thanks so much for watching this video if you liked it and found it helpful please hit that like button and subscribe
also a lot of my drawing experiences over the last year or so been on either the surface pro or the iPad pro
I can say is that the artists soul leaves a fantastic first impression from the moment that you open the box and lift it out
there is something to be said for having a tactile button that you can feel with your thumb and actually press
like control and undo and one's an eraser and all of those are customizable so you can change them to whatever you need
I was surprised at how little time it took me to get used to having those buttons instead of the on-screen touch commands that
there this is not a touchscreen it only works with the stylus you can get a Wacom Cintiq with a touchscreen
fortunately for me they have this really cool circular button right here in the middle you can map that to all sorts of things for example
I think the reason for that is because you don't need a battery and you don't need to recharge it or anything
the screen was really bright and really sharp so I tried out this pen with some of my favorite inking tools and I loved the results
I was getting really smooth strokes in Photoshop which I like the wiggle that you see here is really because of my hand
I didn't think it would because oftentimes the drivers would have some kind of conflict with other drawing tablets on the surface
I hadn't really thought about it until after the fact so if all these things are great what's wrong with the d3
I noticed this tiny little wiggle to the brushes when I was moving in an upward angle on my strokes it was really really pronounced in this program called
I noticed another person in the forum also had a similar problem that I had with kind of slight jitter to it
that person said they had to upgrade to Mac OS El Capitan in order to kind of fix their problem with the drivers
it almost felt like my palm was made of rubber and it was rubbing against the screen which is hard because
I moved my palm a lot when I'm inking but after using it for a few hours whatever was kind of on that screen had kind of worn off
those those companies have worked really hard to take the screen and move it up as close to the glass as possible
if you're looking for a drawing tablet that you can plug into your Mac or plug into your PC and use it as an extra monitor
they haven't asked me to say anything in particular nor to pre-approve this video just for me to share with you my opinion and experience using this product
you also get a pen stand and this also opens up and you can store your extra pen tips or nibs inside now
there's no stand so i've had to just prop this up just to get rid of some reflections for the video
also we've got six express keys on the side here and through the driver you can actually assign these to open apps to do various things within the application
a lot of people talk about this when you're looking at graphic uh displays for uh drawing is the parallax and there is some parallax here very very minimal
though you can calibrate of course which minimizes this but you do see very slight amount of parallax but hardly anything there
the ips display on here as well is very high quality really good viewing angles on this good quality of display with good color saturation
just follow that very carefully and you won't have any problem at all installing this so that's it for my video
I hope since the details in this video will help you decide if you really want to buy this thing or not
so and that's coming from somebody who has small hands but don't let that scare you away from adjusting and I knew you can get used to it
the size is roughly 7 inches by 4 and a half inches with an active drawing area of 4 inches by 2 and 1/3 inch like
SBT USB cord allowing you to use most standard camera cords with this in case the one that came with it became inoperable now everything sounds great
I didn't feel so constricted maybe I just gotten more used to it by then I had to take many breaks to stretch my hands though normally
something compare that is a 27-inch screen and how much movement on the tablet equals how much distance on the screen
I may get that tablet in the future just to D review on it also because they live small tablets so thank you so much for watching
they did send me the tablet for free but they did not pay me to say anything or to give them any any props
i mean i've been using xp pen for at least five years and i've tested a few of the others like huion pablo and artisol
this is by far the best carrying case i've seen with any tablet it comes with two sections one section for your accessories and one section for the tablet
i can't use half the shortcuts on my on my on my tablets that i have from x2pen like i can from senselab
i have a 15.6 pro from xp pen and honestly even though that's a display tablet and i enjoy using display tablets
but you will see how i'm using this tablet in that scenario later in the video too do check the description
there is a direct link to the product page and i may have a discount code so you can save a bit of money too
the technical specs paint a positive impression for a budget tablet and the build quality appearance and feel with my hands does come across as made to a respectively
and we can use this to compare results against other tablets and see where this tablet lies in the leaderboard it takes about 13 minutes to complete so
the specs on paper of the wi-fi protocols supported by the tablet should have a maximum download throughput of up to 54 megabits a second
my wi-fi router is located on the floor below me and i had no problem getting a strong signal in any part of my house
i tested both the netflix and prime video apps and both worked without a hitch but of course to avoid any copyright complications
nothing stretches a tablet more than gaming so i have a few demonstrations to see how well the px80 handles this
in a moment you'll get to hear the sound quality coming from the tablet which is being recorded by my microphone happening
but there was no other are coming for us way now i have to find a way to keep them busy systems so donations foreign playing
it's the perfect size for simracing telemetry duties and also very handy for reading web pages and watching videos while sitting in the rig
hopefully you've had a good impression from the footage i've recorded from my experience using this tablet every day since i've owned it it's been fantastic
now thank you very much for watching and i hope you found something useful in my review today so until next time take care and bye bye
and there's a lot of rumors flying around of what we're going to see as some of those are not really rumors because Samsung and LG
xperia said for tablets took quite some time after the announcement before we could actually get it in our hands i materialized this summer of summer of 2015
I've been in love with it ever seen every video I made since then I've been talking about how great this tablet is
so this is a review of the Sony Xperia set for tablets and some idle speculation about the future of Sony and of tablets in general enjoy
you can see the little camera front camera and you have a sony logo up in the left corner very discreet logo on the back
which in my experience a is pretty easy to keep away from fingerprints although my hands are not usually GUI Zi
which is this signature round power button that the xperia said series had up until the newly released set 5 on the top
so you can't really see it but it is quite easy to find with your finger when you're using it alright so you might say
it's kind of loud but obviously there's not much bass in these these speakers so I prefer to use the headphones
which means that if you put it flat on the face light so it doesn't actually touch the glass to the surface
there's not much difference in weight so now i stopped buying these because i can bring this instead and with the tablet i can watch movies
it is not super amoled but I prefer it that way actually it's got the Snapdragon 820 SOC inside with the Adreno 430 graphical processing unit so GPU
in for instance the Xperia set 3 plus phone that Sony released year ago and LG actually opted to use the less powerful a 28 in there
that might have been something to do with it for this tablet though and i've been using it for eight months every day played some pretty heavy games on
it's got a microSD slot where you can put up to 128 gigs off of external storage internal storage is 32 gigs
this model is the Wi-Fi only and there's also a cell phone version with the LTE 4G the thickness that I talked about earlier is actually 6.1
this is better because it doesn't have that over saturated colors that you need to dial down when you buy it here
you possibly can see that it is handling everything pretty well as no problems in navigation or opening apps and stuff like that it can handle most games
XCOM and lara croft go and some other apps it get kind of crowded so i uninstalled all my action 3d games
obviously but it's not going to be that much of an improvement and quite frankly upping the RAM or the storage
they have followed their omnibalance design philosophy stripping away things taking away unnecessary design items stripping it down making it clean
from a technical point of view that the managed to do it but kind of useless pointless thing that had this mirror finish back which most people
they really need to skip the only balanced design and come up with something new and that is hard and that's going to take some time and
I'm not sure it's only ever going to do that because I kind of been on this minimalistic design philosophy forever
i know that in some markets they are bungling with bundling it with the keyboard which makes it even more expensive than it already is
I got mine without the keyboard the Wi-Fi only version and it wasn't too expensive and I think definitely it was worth my money
I use it every day for watching movies for watching TV for playing games for surfing the web for checking my emails
so take a look at the set for tablet unless of course there is a set 6 or set 5 tablet coming out in couple days
I think it's going to be excellent when you take a look at a tablet like the Sony Xperia said for tablet
you can get more into these devices now but it doesn't really give you that much of an improvement over what ever was before
we're still not seeing you know software or apps that use this resolution screen to run is significant degree and we cannot
and that's a problem with for tablets today the Android operating system is not good enough for doing tablet things on my sony
that i can't play on any other tablet that i have those are the Grim Fandango which is a game level
possibly the best ever such game and xcom enemy within is of course a turn-based action strategy game two really good games
that's a massive game that takes you know days to finish if you ever finish it and it works very well on the tablet what
I am convinced that this tablet xperia set for tablet would be able to handle for instance civilization 5 without any problems really
yes you have to recompile the code and you have to possibly reduce the the complexity of the graphics and quite a bit because the game is huge
it's just no incentive this stuff that came out last year and the year before it's basically so good and that there's no real point in upgrading them
I can still play all the games I've tried on my set three phone which is a year and a half old now
I like em gee they are actually thinking outside the box with their new modular design for the g5 which they are announcing tomorrow
press the pause button if you want to kind of pause on that and look over everything so this is the device itself
you get a microphone on the bottom there though you have a speaker then on the side you have an SD card slot
so what we're going to do is just look at a book because this we're good e-reader first and foremost we want to see what books look like
so you have different screen settings really cool to have like grey stone reverse black and white white black so that's really cool
it's it's pretty responsive you have a quick navigation you can go to any page you wish via that little bar bottom
we just chose some as a placeholder so if you chose a romance and teens and kids it'll look like that if you chose
Barnes & Noble stuff there's also Google Apps because this is a Google Play certified device you can actually get Google Gmail Maps YouTube and etc
we bought it just to show you guys what it's capable of because Barnes & Noble does have a large magazine marketplace
I don't know no these black bars on top because of the ratio you actually can't fit it but I know Patrick Stewart he's cool
all have you know like a exorbitant battery sizes and huge processors and one gig of ram two gigs of ram so
I'm glad nuke is actually making stuff again instead of rebranding Barnes and Samsung stuff and putting new clothes on it
hello guys Umberto and in today's video were to talk about this new pen display tablet by Galman the PD 156 pro
it allows you to use your computer directly through the screen with it's been and it's mail used by artists to create digital art
it is battery free and it's super sealed as well which is great it comes with a stand that contains extra nibs and believe me
look for your tablet model and go to the driver section and download the driver that's meant for your PC windows or Apple
you just need to click on the next button until it's finished but I recommend you to uninstall the other tablets from your computer
if you have any so that the driver can work without any interferences then reboot your computer and you can just open the driver and set up the shortcuts
the pressure the working area the calibration and everything from there the power button is on the right side and it becomes green
the last key on the left side to adjust those settings you need to use the keys on the right side
I don't even have a calibrated screen to compare the screen to so I don't know how accurate the colors are out of the box
I think it's it can be portable and if you're a student you need to move around a lot with your graphic tablet
I want to prove the mood of my illustration therefore I need to improve my light and shadow knowledge which is very bad as you can see from this
Spade paintings because I wanted to be a digital artist and I feel like I I go to a good point back in a days
you want and follow the on-screen prompts while being careful not to touch anything in the car while the tune is being written to the ECU
we've made another video that outlines the process in detail and shows how to switch between 85 and 91 octane gas or vice versa with the open flash tablet
no longer warrants a downshift into fourth or fifth and throttle response is also improved giving the car a more willing and playful personality
Raceway on the 8510 here we were running the Falcon to Z knees up front and the stock wheels and tires in the back
gains thanks to the open flash tablet and Vishnu tuning sure we could boost the BRZ but right now we fill up
and today we're going to be reviewing the Dell Latitude 7350 to Iman tablet so this is the laptop / tablet it comes with an Intel processor
it has eight gig of ram and 128 gigs solid-state drive though there are different models available with bigger hard drives more or less ram
it's not going to be very powerful and it's not going to replace your standard laptop with an i3 i5 or even i7 processor
so the months of itself it is quite heavy and it tends to be quite top-heavy because everything is built-in to deliver the laptop
the base itself basically contains the battery the keyboard and the ports so nothing else everything else is built into the lid of the laptop now
Ethernet port so if you do need why these nets you have to buy some sort of USB adapter for it
so it usually starts with the dell splash screen and then use the 10 to 15 seconds later it will have actually
we're at the windows login screen so if I log into the laptop you'll be able to see how it locks in
so there's a little button there you slide the one and lift up and it turns into a tablet it's asked you with
that not only accepts input from this pen that's supplied but also accepts input from touch much like you would use on a on a trackpad on a MacBook
the actual active area is slightly smaller than that though you'll get in an active area of about 113 millimeters by roundabout 160 millimeters in width
now there is also a medium version of this tablet and that takes the overall size up to 337 by 223 millimeters
I'm actually using tablet to control my cursor on the screen we're going to system preferences we've got a pen tablet system preference here and from here
the moment is configure to touch toggle on this top bun so if I actually click that it stops the graphic tablet from working with my fingers
you can drag items around your desktop and then you can do gestures such as scrolling zooming rotating and even going forwards and backwards through photos and
I'm no artist so I'm not going to do anything too fancy here but I just wanted to show you that
I can reverse the pen round here and actually going to eraser mode and actually it raised some of the image I've been doing and it works very well
indeed and when the pen is not being used I can just pop it into that holder on the right hand side so overall
a lot of people have asked me to do redesigns of some of my own characters like S&T and flaming knuckles
I did through fan votes a couple years ago so that means I will be redesigning flaming knuckles today all while using this new ghoul
at putting on screen protectors and after fixing up the hip detection by messing with the screen display settings in the calibration
Fannin t-this also has that as well so I decided to incorporate these things onto knuckles all while making the markings more angular
angular shapes on characters usually symbolize danger so it makes sense for flaming knuckles to have more angles on him because he was created to be dangerous
so far and having a lot of fun with this new tablet it's really convenient to be able to draw on a surface like paper
I kept the socks and the gloves that same dark gray I colored the shoes in a sort of inverse pattern from the original design then
I tried to incorporate the purple from the original design but it didn't really look right so I decided to just scrap it
I decided to color the spikes on the shoes different levels of color kind of like fire rosy pumpkins flaming knuckles design
has this sort of ombre effect going with the eyes so I played with that idea and I liked it a lot
I do recommend most screen tablets especially Wacom screen tablets go for thousands of dollars while this one is actually a fraction of that price
hi pinky boos here and we're gonna do an unboxing and review of a walk on one creative pen display digital or tablet now
New York tablets before I um I did do digital art like twice but I had to teach myself to draw with a mouse
I like the color scheme on these because most Wacom everything is like black and it's really light that would probably all the hookups
the nose will get hooked up and we'll be back and we'll do some tests on it and then we're gonna drop some stuff so stick around
if you're like me you probably don't use touchscreen very often anyway if you're doing drawing so it's not really a loss
that's definitely a perk for me for sure because a lot of tablets they have you know very complicated hookups in this one is very easy definitely
the one does not have an eraser on the end of it like the more expensive one comes so you actually would have to use the eraser tool here
I did once but it was on like a really really really old drawing tablet and it was very confused because I didn't know how anything worked
do your pencil drawings first and then you can do your inking overtop of it but the most serious digital art
I've ever done was on Photoshop so I don't know if that says anything well but actually what a digital artist use Photoshop
I have two but they're not the prettiest I cannot do them it's it's a curse but I'm just like doing whatever
I'm gonna give you some final thoughts on the wacom one tablet as I do so I'm gonna draw you an Uncle Scrooge
USBC as I understand it and one big drawback for me personally is that the stylus does not have an eraser
I'm like oh I'm just gonna scratch my my screen up so just be aware that with this tablet there are some features from a higher-end
we're going to be posting more art and animation videos over there if you're looking for more pop culture news views and rants sub to this channel
I might be a bit late to the game when it comes to Amazons fire tablets but now that I've had a chance to play around with one
that's somewhere between an e-reader and a full-fledged tablet computer with an 8 inch display and either 16 or 32 gigs of memory
TV shows play games download and use apps like Instagram or Facebook and shop the Amazon app and do things like check your orders
the previous fire was about 7 inches to the new ones 8 inch screen size the resolution has also increased and the screen is now
it's not super bright and I preferred to take it off adaptive brightness which adjusts the display strength to the ambient light in the room instead
so you're not going to be able to get all the bells and whistles you might with something like an iPad pro
this camera has an improved front-facing 2-megapixel camera it's got 720p video for HD calling the previous generation fire had a VGA front-facing camera
I'm thinking something like the Google pixel 3 the Samsung Note 9 or even the Apple iPhone 10 but I will say that at this price point
the tiny speakers get pretty loud and should be enough to annoy your whole row and everyone around you on the airplane
I quickly decided to add Spotify Netflix Instagram Twitter and Google key which is an amazing organizational app by the way and a few others
fire tablets in the US have Alexa smart digital assistant functionality built in but this features not been enabled in Canada yet
you'll see the app on the tablet and you can click on it to open it up but nothing works yet
I asked Amazon why the feature isn't working and when it should be enabled and all they could tell me is they're working on it now
you can post questions either there on the blog or of course here on the YouTube channel as well if you like this video and found it helpful
it's around thirty dollars or thirty pounds of your in the UK and it's pretty decent it's I don't know why they've got ducks all over it
I'm afraid if you look it up on their website they haven't got ducks anywhere for the huion s s HS 64 but
they've got stickers and they've got a big sort of ducks around and think maybe they're trying to appeal to students
you like that sort of thing so tell me students if you like that sort of thing put in the comments below that
I love Ducks perhaps I don't know but yes so it's got ducks around it but don't let that put you off because it is a good graphics tablet
I'm finding though with most of these graphics tablets that I've been sent is that they're much the same even the Wacom ones that I use daily
oddly outclassed a lot of these slightly higher price devices that i've seen this year and i'm looking at you in particular samsung chromebook 4
you know a little chugging and then back to business um it's got four gigs of ram so maybe that helps out a little bit
all right i'm sure you're waiting for the part where i had some concerns and this is where the device falters for me the keyboard
however if i get the stylus in before i have to return this device to lenovo i will leave an update in the information below
it's nice it kind of reminds me of the old google nexus 7 tablets from a few years back or maybe just a large smartphone
this is that i think they do a really really good job of making this device feel way more premium than the price tag would let you assume
you probably like me too much weird so come on and give me a subscribe and like the video as well
if you're looking for a chromebook right now under 450 i legitimately think you should not even consider another device than this one
that you guys have been asking for and then after that it's into our holiday buying guide and we'll do some comparison videos between all those so of course
let me know so i can always cater my content to make sure that you're getting the information that you want out there on that
I think it's android 5.1 but I've been using it predominantly in Windows since I've had it because I prefer it that way to be honest with you
Windows 10 which is 10 home and android 5.1 the ROM is actually a 32 gigabyte e MMC ram is 2 gigabytes of ddr3
the little tablet also has support for TF card or SDHC whichever when I look at it up to 32 gigabytes now then the storage
I'm still fellow is split up between Windows 10 as you see here and the android 5.1 as you can see says this PC is 29.1 gigabytes available
MMC drive in here so it's pretty much fragmented and I can show you how fragmented it is if we go back to
Disk Management you can see along the bottom here you can see how they fragmented it up into lots of little sections for whatever reason these are
I've had to do because I actually broke the operating system the other week while I was messing about with it so I had to recover it again
I don't think for my for my usage of the thing anyway but you know if you're just an average user and you want Android as well as Windows
at least it will be from the 16th of April to the 18th of April so I guess they only get
so what they do they supply you this little adapter cable here so you can plug it into the device and then you can plug any standard
USB device into it with this little cable here we have your earphone socket there this is where the TF card goes in just here
we have a lengthy cable here to connect it to computer and we also have this charger which they supply you
so what we'll do is we'll pause it there at eight seconds and we'll just take a look at the photo and the video that
I think if you were used to how Windows 10 works you should be able to get on all right with this little tablet here because it's all here
I think it looks quite good as the proper desktop to be honest with you cuz you can have all your room
it's a goodly amount smaller than a 10 inch tablet as does make it a little bit more portable and of course you can run all off your favorite
you've got the standard USB connection here and if you push it through to the other side hopefully there we go
there's all the files on there and you can also eject it gogo eject and a healthy pops if you're wondering where your right-click menu is on this tablet
is you got to refresh whatever you like just a long press will bring you up the right-click menu that would use on your mouse
you can see the little cursor there so we can run that around the screen so you can also click on the menu there that becomes Microsoft edge
there are some much nicer ones out there and you can also run it with a house as well if you've got a Bluetooth enabled Mouse
there's plenty of programs available in the App Store as well and Windows app store but so you can just download your ordinary programs and load them on here
I'm going to try and wipe off the Android side of things and just use it as a fully fledged Windows 10 tablet or tablet PC
Instagram feed there's my Google+ you can help the channel greatly by purchasing via my gearbest link in the description text below
there's a couple of ways to support in the channel down there the other one being via my patreon page as well guys
don't forget to leave any comments and questions down below and I'll take a look at them if I get a minute as well guys
so I suppose the first thing to say is although it's a child's tablet and that's what it's been bought for this is a fully fledged 7-inch Android tablet
you can just lock it down for your child so they don't get access to the wider world bother than that fully fledged 7-inch
it's all all good right gallery not the best of cameras neither but this is a picture that I've taken outside as you can see
but the main thing would go over to the apps it comes pre-loaded with a load of kids apps obviously because it's its Android
you can download whatever you want if I just go back to the main screen though so this is the kids
so there's a pin to come out of it which is probably the best thing or you can answer a question
fantastic the speaker's not too bad it doesn't distort or anything like that's quite low but imagine taking this out in about it's sturdy slightly rubberized
I'm sure that could be dropped quite easily from her from a relatively well definitely LT carpet from three or four foot
it is a little bit wobbly so i wish it was kind of magnetic so it would snap into place or you could also place it horizontal
this is the instruction it just gives you the website on where to download the software is not an actual cd
in the settings it also comes with 16 soft keys which are totally customizable so i have a macbook pro that is 13 inches
if you get like your pen tablet for the first time it helps a lot with your hand eye coordination so just be sure if you buy a tablet
it actually went by way faster than the outline and right now like a month almost a month after having the tablet
hope y'all have a beautiful wonderful rest of the day and keep creating have fun and yeah till next time bye bye
and secondly it's also very inexpensive coming in at only $200 and it has a nine point seven inch capacitive multi-touch enabled 720p HD display and
that's pretty much it the other interesting thing about this tablet actually has a 30 pin dock next recharge the device
the exact same charger you'll find on the older Apple iPhone or perhaps an iPod Touch or even an older iPad
magnet is the first thing that you'll notice and unfortunately that means it gets smudges and some scratches on like crazy
the chrome like metal and the same thing can be said about the back which is actually also made out of metal and even though it means
this is actually one of the larger downsides to actually purchasing this tablet because the power on and off switch is so hard to press also here
there's also a 30 pin dock connector for charging and syncing device with a PC a microphone and a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
they take you back the search the home and the menu buttons now those work pretty well for the main part
so when you're actually viewing the tablet or playing games with it using the accelerometer even as you're turning this tablet to multiple orientations you'll still see that
the screen does a nice job of displaying the same colors and resolutions that you might typically see from a more limited degree of a degree of view
there's not a lot of bloatware on here so basically you have just the traditional access to the Google and navigational services and the Gmail
we found that when we turned Wi-Fi on and continued to continuously used heavy flash enabled sites and were browsing the web
we're going to connect to our Wi-Fi network here and get going to show you the web browser browsing experience which is for the most part pretty impressive
and we're pretty impressed with the performance aspect on that now device also have the ability to of course display live wallpapers
you can select from those through the settings and have a nice host for you to select from as far as touch screen sensitivity goes
and so it's definitely easy to use now another impressive aspect or reason why you might purchase whip hand versus any other tablet out
there is the fact that it supports multiple languages right out of the gate seeing that lepen is actually a Japanese manufacturer
a front-facing 0.3 megapixel camera and a rear-facing 2 megapixel camera it retails for $64 one of the major selling points behind this device is Android 9.0
everything's turn into perfect circle's now apps used to be like square and then they had rounded corners and then they just started going circular
you can basically do anything you want with it right out of the box but there is one thing that actually stands aside on the bottom
Kobo signed a massive deal with Walmart to have ebooks and audiobooks available so roughly about like 500 to about 750 Walmart stores in the States
you can see that we can buy it for a dollar related titles book reviews so everything's sort of singular on one page
I'm surprised that the speaker's amaldi is like really solid even with the tablet lying basically with a speaker you know we're not doing Dolby technology
if you want to do it like this otherwise you can just read it kind of fullscreen or just like isolate specific frames
anything that you could really do in terms of standard ebook reading experience like Walmart ebooks audio books digital comics manga
I'm gonna prove to you that I can be just as mediocre on an inexpensive tablet as I can be on an expensive one
I'm hoping that the quality of the artwork I produce is gonna be just as good as what I could have produced on my iPad
Pro obviously might like losing one better than the other but what we're talking about here is the end product what you're actually able to create with it
I took it for a spin and built a website to showcase my work and they have some really great templates
if you're showing off your work to potential clients or looking to land a full-time job these templates look really professional
and if you really want to take it to the next level you can set up your own custom domain or transfer one
I think this is the one that I'm gonna go with ladies and gentlemen I present you with the Huyen oh shoot
Oh Brad alright so I'm back to Amazon it got myself another tablet and I promise you this time I will be careful I promise
I want to point out here is that I am drawing a Photoshop that is part of Adobe's Creative Cloud suite
also what you see here is a 15-inch laptop so you're taking something that's four inches wide and you're spreading it to something that's much much bigger so when
but in this case if you're drawing with something smaller to offset some of the problems you might have doing that
I was feeling so much more comfortable drawing on this than I was at the beginning where I had wobbly lines
I wasn't sure what I was doing and if I had to go back and use this as say import folio piece
and just redraw that person when you zoom out those lines look fine and actually adds to the character a little bit another thing worth pointing out
I can assure you it absolutely is I think pressure sensitivity is probably one of the most overrated stats on drawing equipment today
it only had like a thousand maybe was 500 levels of pressure and honestly even back then so many years ago
I had been using the tablet for a half-hour 45 minutes so I had gotten used to drawing up but the other part of it is with color
I found that I'm not used to drawing with my wrist and my finger so much and doing those tiny details
where you can save a bunch of money on a bunch of their products check out the description for more details so quite a few months ago
making a product review on the PD 1560 I figured it was an awesome opportunity to help out their company while also broadening
I don't think I have ever in my entire life procrastinate as hard as I have on making this video but procrastination time is over
the future is now and it is time to take a look at the Galman PD 1560 drawing tablet so inside the box
the tablet to the stand was reasonably intuitive and quick installing the drivers and getting the tablet up and running was also no problem
I was able to start messing around and drawing within 15 minutes of opening the box one thing I want to talk about right off
I worked hard to get things clean and apply the protector very very carefully but it still managed to hold on to some bubbles
you want to program press the keys that you want the button to act as click apply and boom master programming skills
I usually have it set about right in the middle so I'd say it can hit any angle you would realistically need
it's also capable of being attached to the tablet backwards in order to set the buttons on the right side for left-handed artists
it has a pretty good weight maybe just a little bit on the light side and the look of the pen goes well with the tablet itself
if you're really curious to see what this tablet is truly capable of just know that for my personal use it gets the job done above and beyond
I'll be sure to leave links in the description to everything you'll need thanks so much for watching and I will see you guys next time bye
you can seem to get it a bit cheaper on eBay in places but that's obviously up to you but a hundred thirty pounds so is quite expensive
give your pen that feeling of paper that everybody's after in some ways that feeling of paper is that the best feeling
but it's always down to how it feels and I would say this is one of the best it in fact this is the best
I'm not comparing it to display tablets just yet so I'll come into that a bit later but the feel of the pen across the tablet was really nice
the lines are all straight - no wobble no janky 'no surround the place the corners were all good so you go to the corners knee
it and this is has programmable buttons that you can change for different programs and that's got something over the classic huion
I'll come to that in just a moment and so the other thing it does boast is being able to link up to your mobile phone
it's that very low price but we'll start it's encroaching on the price of this so would I go for that
it's really tough to say as soon as you start going to the corners of that one you start seeing sort of glitches
the pen isn't in quite the right place on the screen and so forth so there are issues with that so a low price display tablet
very nice and very comfortable to use the pen itself has programmable buttons which you can see on there to program buttons and it feels very nice
Wacom actually they probably looked at a Wakko and thought let's do a whack on because it's it's pretty much the same
I do like X B pen and quite impressed with them so I can firmly say and safely say this say goodbye at the only thing
I've ever used take from that what you will anyway thank you for watching and I will see you next time
I received this tablet for free to try out and I haven't been paid for this so I'm not saying anything good because I've been told to
I will inevitably be mentioning any similarities or differences between this and that device just because of my previous experience and that's kind of the context
I seemed to have a strange amount of trouble getting into and there was also packaging for him to protect it as well
in addition there was a separate smaller box which contained all of the accessories and I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of accessories
there's also a USB cable there's power cables I don't know what's included in international models but in this one it came with UK and a u.s. power cable
they look and feel a little bit plasticky compared to the ones that I'm used to but they didn't seem to show any sign of scratching
you just press a lever to slide the stand up and down to the height you want and this was very easy to do
I would have preferred a three-in-one cable as opposed to having a separate USB power cable and HDMI cable over the desk
you just go on the kenting website search for the right model and away you go but it took a couple of tries to install
there was also a comprehensive user manual available online for if you wanted something more in depth than the Quick Start Guide and I found this quite helpful
I kept the pressure on the lowest setting because I found it was the closest one used - which equals out to about the middle setting on other tablets
I think I started off just doing some loose sketching and trying to get a feel for how this tablet was to use
I felt like the anti glare protection came with the flipside of muting the colors a little bit compared to the laptop screen however
I know many lower price screen tablets do have some degree of it so this is not a rare thing for anyone who doesn't know what that means
several times and persistently notice the cursor was to the left of the pen tip by just a millimeter or two
this sounds like a very small amount now that I say it but considering it's just not something I'm used to
it just took me a little while to figure out there was no noticeable lag on this tablet and I was very impressed with the pen pressure
it does look like it's lacking quite a bit in this video but I found that that's the thing that happens when you record work on screen tablets
and it didn't seem to exhibit any breaks in the line so they went from thin to thick very smoothly and I didn't notice any what I'd call
blots where sometimes a tablet can just have a bit of a funny moment and miss read where the pen nib is and draw
don't wait you don't want it one thing that I really liked was the scroll wheel on the side of this device
if you don't want to use the pen holder or if you want to store the whole tablet away for a while another problem
the tablet wouldn't retain its settings when I switch the computer and tablet back on and though it would display the desktop
the size of this tablet is a nice balance between being closer to a portable device and the bulk of a much larger screen
the drawing experience was comfortable with a surface that had enough grip not to allow the pen to slide around and the pen itself feels like good quality though
or sorcerer idiot the pirate son is who uses lightning based magic wears a ridiculous scarf and spends most of his time squabbling with the party rogue
I have more tablet reviews on the way so please stay tuned for more thanks for watching and I hope to see you next time bye
and so you can plug it into your PC or laptop and have a screen that you can draw on and a pressure-sensitive pen
I kept the screen protector on because it lessened the glare from the lights but normally when I'm working I tend to take it off
then there's the drawing glove this fits on both the right and the left hand if it's one on the left then
rather than on the top but the glove does work on both hands and the tablet is designed for both left and right-handed users
so it's not too much and you just want to follow the instructions and link all the cables together so now
I'm setting the tablet up on my desk so I can start working just plugging everything in and then turning on the screen
I first put in the driver disk and downloaded the software and then I was prompted to download the updated version of the driver from XP pens website
and you can adjust the tablet to different heights and angles to draw on this screen lays completely flat on the desk like a rake like a regular
iPad type of tablet does if you want a raised angle surface to work on then the company does sell a stand to go along with a tablet
I work flat so it didn't feel too different and I think that's a good thing I felt like I was just drawing at my desk
I found that this pen was much better and less tiring tiring for me to use for long periods of time
now that's a very person on one particular thing for me but if you have small hands and this might be useful to know
it's best to have no other program running at the same time that can really help now if you have a faster
I tried to move it across the screen this was fixed instantly when I downloaded the latest version of the driver software
I found for me that using on has helped speed up my workflow and drawing digitally and I used a small
Wacom tablet not a screen one but the smallest little tablet for a while before stepping up to one of these tab screens
what comes in the box is that you have a tablet a case cover a usb cable an adapter a stylus and a user guide and a quick start
so this tablet is really lightweight like a small inside and it's light so it's perfect for your kids tiny little hands
all you have to do is just pull it out like that and you can just set it like on a table so here
it's nice to have a glove because it helps your hand glide smoothly over the tablet surface while you draw once
you can put your extra nibs and wireless receiver directly in the pin holder to make traveling with all your materials really easy
I was able to have a really comfortable drawing experience while I worked with it the q11 K has 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity
I don't have to press down super hard and apply a lot of pressure on my hand to get colors up on the canvas
these keys are essential for me personally so I was glad to have them right there on the side for easy access
having the ability to go wireless made moving my setup from one room in my house to the next of breeze
the only thing I wished was possible with this tablet is I'd love if I could program the pin button to be the color picker
I wasn't able to program that on this particular tablet perhaps in the future I will be able to with an update
I was able to program a shortcut key on the side to be the color picker go in Network discard all in all
I'll keep the speed paint rolling but thank you for watching and for stopping by until next time guys happy painting you
Amazon and I bought this just because I wanted to be a rebel from the people who are buying know who II on 420 tablets when you unbox it
I drag my pen across the tablet so I think the friction calls the matte finish of the tablet to become glossy okay
OSes so at one point I had to pry out the button so they will work after I pry it out the button
the tablet surface is easy to move around and it is very easy to make sudden stops if you hover then
there is the stand and it's pretty heavy but the tablet is like lighter than this the back of the stand
I thought was like really cool because I know that like a Cintiq can't do that like it only has like three levels anyway underneath
you're probably meant to take it off but I'm gonna leave it on because I don't want to scratch it up on the back
I found it easier to put the stand down to put them in and for the front ones to put them up
go into the computer except that very far one on the left that one goes and connects to the power adapter and
whatever and this one goes into this other chord which is the power adapter and you plug that in to power it on
to put it back in you just push it in and and on the inside of it if you can unscrew it please okay on the inside of it
but my package came with these two gloves that are meant to like not get your oils onto your screen or like so
your hand doesn't like get all sweaty or scratch up your screen for whatever reason and then this is what my setup looks like okay so when
why isn't my friend pressure working what is going on and I forgot to download the drivers manual from their website
Windows Mac whatever tablet you have you download it open it you install it very easily and straightforward with like a setup wizard
you have to make sure that you don't have any other tablets already installed because you'll have to uninstall them but this
I got this new computer so I didn't have anything else installed on it so it was just pretty straightforward once
you can go into your drivers setup and you can program all your keys your pen pressure and most importantly is this monitor calibration
you just click on the dots and if your pen is like off or whatever it'll fix it and after that
this tablet works on like a lot of art programs like Photoshop medibang SketchBook Pro Illustrator side - and obviously what I use is clip studio
I don't know it's kind of long and I do already have like another video planned all that good stuff also I opened up a merch shop
I only are like two things if you want to wait until I like fully update my shop or something you can do that whatever
as kids are going with a new learning system and for this method requires an affordable device though mobiles are a viable choice if you consider tablets
it's not too thin for you to treat it properly for viewing but i have to admit that it's 450 grams
it had only the alcatel logo on the middle region and some manufacturing informations at the bottom starting from the top we find the 3.5
it's not the punch in terms of colors and contrast either it would have been much cooler if alcatel has fitted this with a 1080p
it's pretty much good for indoor use but there is too much glaring when i try it outside on the other hand
the bezels are little thick but the good thing is it's 10 inch long so you can always get a decent view of whatever you are watching or reading
smart tablet is a budget tablet that offers detailed specifications for the basic tasks like surfing the web reading and occasional consumption of music and videos
however and it lags heavily when i try to open four or five apps but running one or two applications is smooth one
like call of duty because it takes too much time to load and there will be regular lags and frame drops but for casual gamers
if you use zoom for conference or online courses frequently the vocals are very audible even though on high volume it produces
well when i tried my wired headphones and bluetooth headphones in this device sound recording is simple and easy understood as well
it carries a solid design a respectable processor and other useful features as well while in some aspects it lacks consistency
multitasking is also pretty smooth and the overall web browsing experience is also actually pretty good on this top s 10.5 and
I would say that installed the Opera browser that works a lot better on this tab s 10.5 moving towards the journal specs
you can just use that and your phone will be mirrored to the tablet and now you can directly control your phone directly from the tablet
I have to say that would be the display of this tablet the Super AMOLED screen is an excellent screen that Samsung has put on this tablet
and it's a very high resolution screen and also it's a very bright screen another thing that I like about this tablet is the weight
these are some minor cons first is regarding the speakers though it has two speakers but these are at the side and
I have reviewed the big a 15 the main difference between the 1/5 Dean and a-15 Pro is with the pro model
there's this control wheel here with the Vig a 15 non-pro is just a colored ring without anything in the middle here
and if you have any issues with pressure sensitivity or the pen not working as expected you may need to troubleshoot by turning
you can assign specific keyboard shortcuts and here you can have accurate mode which will slow down the speed of your cursor to let you draw more accurately
if you are using multiple monitors or not displays you can use monitor switch to jump the cursor from one display to another
here you can go back and forward zoom in zoom out you can open programs with this and this is what invalid which means no assignment and default k13
so now it's working and also you see the pressure settings it's working fine now so let me zoom in a bit closer for you guys to see
I highly recommend you pay an extra four dollars to get a scroll wheel because this is quite useful pressure sensitivity works quite well with Photoshop
I expect them to the performance is quite consistent and I can tap on tablet to create dots like this very easily and the dots
let me try the physical shortcut buttons for the undo and redo okay redo is not a map correctly to my button
but this tablet and pen it doesn't support sensitivity so we don't have to here let's try the pressure sensitivity pressure works as expected
works really well so this is actually one of the better drawing apps for drawing and the lines they come up just the way
you're going to get this performance if you change the curve like this or if you change the curve like this both will perform like this
so that's the issue that I faced so right now there is no way to adjust a precious sensitivity with the Mac OS driver
Compatible with every program I tested except for Moho animation software, so it’ll work in most standard or free drawing programs.
I’m going to go through the box, explain how to set the HS64 up along with troubleshooting, and do a review.
When you plug the tablet into an Android device, the tablet switches to “phone mode” where you can only draw on the left side.
If your tablet does not switch automatically, press and hold the top left button for three seconds to turn on “phone mode.”
Open the settings and click the Administrator privileges button first. Click yes/okay to the popup and wait a couple seconds for the panel to activate.
Often the onscreen keyboard wouldn’t come up with a tablet click, and I’d have to press with my finger to get the keyboard to appear.
The HS64 tablet pen’s pressure sensitivity is fantastic, but you’ll notice on a phone its ability is limited by the drawing app you use.
MSRP now of course click on my Amazon affiliate link in the video description below if you want to see the updated pricing honestly
its physical bill despite being classified as a mid tier model it's thin and light as any premium tablet and just like the tap

i had to say and it was while i was testing out the tablet and doing some research that i remembered another option
install it on your computer and also on your second device and it maps the keys over to a visual display meaning
it sounded like exactly what i was after to solve my poor memory problems so i decided to give it a go game glass and the dragon

it's actually a very good sized tablet and let's get out of this carrying case it is a very good size
the tablet can either be wired or wireless which is really cool and we also have the charging cable for the pen
if you travel you get the pen you get the pen holder you get the cables for charging and the tablet and you also get this glove
so let's get onto the review so overall the setup of the tablet on my computer only took about 10 minutes which
it only took me like 10 minutes and the pressure sensitivity worked right away the pen pressure sensitivity works very low on the tablet
dying on you too often and it does go into sleep mode after it has not been used for a little while which is really handy
for how big the tablet is the tablet has a six by nine working area and to get that big of a working area with competing brands
I would have loved using this tablet when I was beginning digital art so overall my experience with the Helion dwh 69 was a very good one
if we just switch over you've got 8 megapixel no flash built-in NFC Bluetooth 4 and wireless AC so in regards to the built-in apps from HP
I don't know if you can see you can either choose to write on the tablet screen using of course the stylus pen or you can capture book option
you're writing from the notepad the paper version or the notepad it uses some form of ultrasonic microphones built in to kind of mimic and work out
the sides of the tablet are only 6.1 millimeter thin while the mant back surface provides a great grip and feels great at just under 400 grams
the Xperia z4 tablet is lighter than any of its rivals while offering the same screen real estate compared to the iPad air 2 the 10 inch IPS LCD
Sony's small apps which allow you to dog certain apps or widgets as floating windows on the screen which looks like a nice boon to productivity
CPU performance but the graphics chip isn't up to par with the Apple iPad air 2 or the Google Nexus 9 for that matter battery life however is superb
you can browse the web or watch a video for up to 15 hours or you can even get 28 hour worth of code time out of the
Full HD videos aren't quite as rich in detail and there's no 4k video recording either the Sony Xperia z4 tablet is one impressive
the screen is great and so is the performance the support battery life also means that the Xperia z4 tablet will run longer than its rivals
this is a low-end Android tablet it cost about two hundred and twenty dollars as you see it and its best feature by far
this is more of a casual users tablet either 16 gigabytes of storage for your media but you can also pop in a micro
SD card here on the side and add a little bit more so you can put up I think to a 64 gigabyte card so you can you know
it's nothing spectacular but it can take a picture if you need to take a picture and here's a couple of images
so you can take a look and see how those came out the speakers are a little bit tinny on here they do have this
this is castle of illusion which is a Mickey Mouse game that I play from time to time on Android does run pretty well
I said I was using a helium brand tablet before switching to the Galman well the day after I agreed to do that review
alright already we've got points for presentation here and no that is not a typo this is the QE on canvas Pro 16
even when it's not on sale so for this tablet you're gonna have to either pay extra for a stand or use it flat on the table
now how she's this reality-warping thing that isn't even supposed to exist so imagine what would happen if she had all seven
and it's actually kind of dope so I'm also gonna take a little bit of inspiration from it so thanks him spaghetti
cuz I actually like how they look and the gloves that in spaghetti design had and then I added another piece on the bottom that extended to her elbow
it was just a matter of putting the lighter blues and the darker blues in places that made it look good to experiment
it looks like an actual official super form in my opinion at least and I was really happy to see all the positive comments when I was streaming
Pro 16 screen tablet that I was using despite not coming with a stand which still bothers me by the way
Galman tablet so I'll be keeping this tablet for sure I'll leave a link in the description in case you want to check it out for yourself
so here's the unboxing portion of this video the packaging is really really nice but this is not a box review
is the paper where it tells you where to download the driver and the manual and the thank you card and the warranty card
like i said it's pretty small so i really wouldn't recommend it for pro artists out there but for beginner artists
this tablet can attract finger prints as well you can consider these a tablet as the pots finger gestures for zooming panning and rotating but in actual use
Wacom pen and tablet now here we have a NIT remover so basically just use this ring here to clip the nib to put up
that are around a trackpad so you can just click on each individual buttons and assign any specific keyboard shortcuts to them
it seems that it works fine but when the glitch happens it's actually quite irritating but for some reason today it works fine
let's see if it works so here it seems that it works as well so I can get thin and thick lines
pressure looks the lines are smooth the keeper there's no lag whatsoever and the next app that I have is MIDI Bank pane
I've drawn this letter a here so that it will be obvious when I rotate it with the trackpad so I'm going to rotate this clockwise
nope nothing is moving so it doesn't work with mischief and we are not going to attach the trackpad animal because it obviously does not work like it should
I have missed out anything so just to recap with Photoshop sometimes when I open Photoshop create a new file and start drawing quickly
I do not have my Windows computer at home but I have tested them on Windows as well so let me go through
I've tried Photoshop CC as well and when I try Photoshop CC the brush it does not paint so when I try drawing on the screen
maybe it's just a problem with this specific model that I receive so I would like to point you to other reviews especially those on Amazon
I have actually read some positive reviews there so maybe it could just be an issue with this tablet that I'm holding right here in my hand
it's not available so you look at maybe banggood or gearbest to get this tablet for around the hundred pound hundred dollar mark
i think decent specs four gigs of ram 64 gigabytes of internal storage an optical processor usb type-c charging and a 1920x1200 resolution
it's also got a 6000 milliamp battery as well so in the box you get a white usb type-c charging cable and a black charging block
we have stereo speakers interesting to see what they sound like on the other side here is absolutely clear and along the top
there on the back here look you can see the rear camera a few indicators there telling you what the buttons are as well
but you can have 4g sim card in here so you can use data and stuff like that so that is brilliant as well
everyone's ears are slightly different but if it's resonating off something it's quite ear piercing and obviously the sound quality isn't amazingly good but it is acceptable
and you can hear what's coming out the speaker but you may need to just put it down a few notches
that was the most important thing when looking at a tablet or buying a tablet or even using a tablet and performance on
so i've installed a few games and it's handled it really really well and battery life like i said four to five hours six thousand milliamp battery
it's got gps built in there as well and it's got quite a nice display so that is pretty much it guys
if you have any questions then please put them down below as well answer them as best as i can but until next time
it's a paper tablet and you can use to take notes to even create folders and keep yourself organized now a really nice balance between analog and digital
Thinking tool and it's designed to get you offline to help you utilize The written page to some extent so it really does sort of you know
It's about a pencil length thick And it also has a very nice design something that I really liked on the back of it
If you want to put it on a table, so it doesn't necessarily shake or move when you're trying to take notes
One thing I'd say about the back while we're talking about it is the the actual silverback that they've got here
you've got the home button so that will help you to return home and the other two are for scrubbing between pages and
But it's sort of like this weird blend between you'll know you're writing on a digital device, but you're also writing on
But it's something to note because obviously they're I think the tips are in the range of say eight for an aid package
Because it's able to analyze that and then actually produce Text when you're on the screen so that can be pretty helpful for taking notes
I'm very loopy and it didn't really some aspects of it didn't understand my converting so I haven't really used that feature aggressively since
Now the assembly email feature allows you to send any of the pages inside of a notebook or a notebook as a whole
For when you'll attach to Wi-Fi and you want to send it to somebody else and it does definitely look a lot more professional
I'd say is You get when you get the no remarkable Tablet you do get a version which does look incredibly different to the version.
You can also set a passcode and also change the hand writing Conversion settings so that you can change it to another language
You can modify the keyboard as well as some of the other accessibility --zz so there is also something called quick sheets
You can see your battery percentage and your Wi-Fi So before I dive into the pricing and some of the questions
Content notes write notes write thoughts and I particularly enjoyed using at the moment for taking notes when I'm doing courses and Actually saving paper around the house Minimalist
I don't know why I think it's because I know that I'm gonna pass on to someone else in the future
But I think the main reason I like it is because it's really well crafted in its design and it also just works Very well.
I've noticed is That I would sort of like weirdly to be connected to other services but that sort of defeats the point of the product
If for example, you can see a newspaper on here or get crossword or apps like that like Sudoku which I thought initially
And I'm seeing that more and more as I use it because in the evenings if I still want to keep my creative mind
If you get an 8 pack that you need for the top of this pen then it's gonna be 12 bucks
I'm not sure what the quality or the name of the product is, but I'll include it below which range from anything from $79 to 129
On now since we've done this video there is a remarkable - so I will look to get in touch with the team
It's high in price to start out with but it's something that I think I would probably pay the price again
And also it's given me a way to creatively think in the evenings and that's something that has Improved the quality of videos recently
But again their guesses are somewhat environmentally-friendly Ok folks, so I'm looking in the future to do some more iPad apps.
And some of the software side of stuff and the way that you can set up may be useful as a video so folks
now this review will of course be made with us players in mind but the tablet does support most graphic applications with some of them listed on screen
the polling rate of the tablet is around 200 sometimes a bit more whereas a wacom intous has around 1 and 20
and when i switched from a vaccum tablet were thrown 120 polling rate to do who young age 420 with its 200
active area is a barren smaller sign around ten point two times five point eight centimeters or four inches times two point four inches for our American viewers
I noticed as a drag player is that the first week or so the nib will act a bit like a spring
I myself didn't really have a big problem with it but I do know friends that have had really really large issues with this and another thing
so yeah nothing more to say about that and now we come to the dreaded area settings there is no mercy here
I suggest just drawing the area out in a paper placing it on top of the Huyen and then fine-tuning the area until it just matches up
hopefully now we're at the end of this review and this is actually a good tablet at a really good price
there are some minor problems with it but a really minor if you want to get into it more and try playing with the tablet
I hope you liked it and I hope people are okay with us branching out a bit trying some different content
it's got that adjustable stand that everyone will just replace with a monitor arm 8192 levels of pen pressure sensitivity to get them crispy lines
gaomon is having a special this week until the 27th of september 15 off of the pd 2200 and their other tablets are also on sale as well
i only used it for about an hour for this animation and it's been great only thing that annoyed me a bit was the touch buttons
it has a 7.9 inch screen to be exact but that's very close to 8 inches right as I said the iPad Mini 5 has a 7.9 inch IPS
I reviewed inside one's an other 8 worth Bionic processor which also means that it is the fastest 8 inch tablet
it is supported by three gigabytes of RAM and you can choose between 64 or 256 gigabyte of storage in my standard battery test the last at 12
but you've got to buy it separately the iPad Mini is running iPad OS including all these standard features of iPad OS
which is the premium tablet is the huawei immediate pad m58 which is a bit older and the huawei media pad m6 8 which
this tablet used to be the fastest and what habit you can buy for quite a while until the Galaxy Tab s 4 was released back
ship the tablet has 4 gigabytes of RAM and a 32 64 or 128 gigabyte internal storage in my standard battery tester
so the huawei media that m58 was the m-68 which I did not test these are the best premium Android tablets
it hasn't been announced for the rest of the world yet only for the United States and that's why I haven't been able to order it yet
which places it in the middle class has three gigabytes of RAM 32 gigabyte of storage a very modern design and it is running Android 9 again
I didn't reviewed yet but check out this channel and my next update calm because chances are I have reviewed it by the time
a 8.0 with s-pen that's the SMP 200 or P 205 sadly this tablet with S Pen has been only released in a couple of countries
and it's 32 gigabyte internal storage nothing for high-end gaming but certainly for mid-range to low-end gaming the battery life is not that amazing
the next tablet that you might not be able to get as easily depending on where you live is the huawei immediate at M site light 8
Enver to 9 however out of the box which certainly is a plus point compared to the higher-end and 5a things immediate
I'm not sure if this work at any updates so of all this is a great mid-range to low-end tablet and yeah I really enjoyed using see
Lenovo tab m8 by the way it has about my level of l3 which means you couldn't watch Netflix in HD resolution but since the screen is so small
I don't think that's that big of a deal in this case next on the list is another Samsung Galaxy Tab a8 of 0 SMT 290
inch tablet that was announced in the United States it does have an 8 inch screen but only with an HD resolution of 1280 by 800 pixels
it does have a mostly metal body but it does not fear that high-end because the frame is plastic but yeah it's fine
for low end gaming certainly it does have 1.5 gigabytes of RAM which is quite low of course and actually there's no possibilities of having real Madi tossing
if you have any questions please write them in the comments below and again check out the link in the description to my next
Cybercom where we've got an updated list with the best 8 inch tablets even a year from now you will always see our current recommendations on that list
it says that it's got 8,192 levels of pen pressure which is pretty good and it says a lot of other things that
RPS again I don't know what that means but we can assume that's pretty good and comfort a lot of stuff so let's just open the package
I'm pretty sure is for when your need kind of gets like low or damaged or whatever you can replace it by
I'm not sure if it opens up or anything feels like it does open this which oh yeah so there's a ton of nibs in here
I know I never really use these buttons but like if this is something that you like then again you are indeed and what so yeah
good my computer froze several times and just look at the size of this thing in the bottom left corner as time goes on
the pen design was a little generic and boring but ultimately nobody buys a tablet based on how pretty the pen is so honestly
I know but true but anyways I think it's time to get into the actual pros and cons of the tablet starting with the pros so first things first
seeing as the pressure-sensitive V makes it so much more convenient and it also hose with adding all sorts of little details
the a6 10 plus is also really convenient to draw with having 10 hotkeys on the tablet and 2 on the pen
I find that you honestly don't even need to touch your keyboard at all while drawing which really helps make the whole process faster
I mean it's crazy to think that I could get a product of such quality at such a good price anyways now that I've gone over the pros
I mean it's pretty quiet and I didn't hear anything at all while I was listening to music or talking to people as I drew
this shouldn't be an issue for you at all and to be fair the only annoying part for me was uninstalling
this is really really minor but honestly pretty big who has relatively large hands and I know it's not just me because I've seen other reviews that mentioned this
I figured I'd take some time to briefly talk about Don Poe as a character because as you probably know she's who I'm drawing right now
I feel that there are a surprising amount of people who don't understand her character specifically when she blamed jafer there for him till his death
I personally believe that this scene in warriors was one of the best little side plots in the whole series primarily
you would want him to have a small break right so you tell your brother that some of the others are playing on the ice
suddenly someone goes in to try and save him but resurfaces without your brother while deep down you know it would be hard to save someone who is drowning
most would much prefer this than to live with the cost of guilt that they got their own family member killed
she is lashing out and projecting her own feelings of guilt and such for getting her brother killed onto jay feather accusing him of getting flame
what had just happened while you can say anyone would act strange after losing a loved one you can clearly see that
nokia has a name that many associate with mobile technology and they have a new tablet with a tagline thinking ahead
and the best way for me to describe the fill is a sheet of metal the tapered edges gives it a nice rounded
the buttons provide a great tactile field and each press requires a decent amount of travel and this prevents from phantom presses even when shaking the device
zero air gap display the panel should provide for some decent scratch protection due to the fact that is also using Gorilla
it's still fantastic to use and even better to look at the n1 brings a different chipset than what we're accustomed to seeing with
at all it just ran at the same frame rate as it ran if there was just one plant on the screen
the only time there was slowdown is when you hit one of the bombs that ends the game because your whole screen goes white and everything explodes right there
it was a little bit of slow it out but all in all it ran better on this device that I've seen other devices
I've personally used the true test is when Google services are running in the background which we do not have access to just yet
but what makes this launcher really unique is that you can write out what you want to open on your screen and is not specific
take a picture and the camera comes up even if you can't find what you're looking for it does a Google search for it now
so it's quite possible when the international version is released the launcher will provide even more functionality but I like it the way it is it works
but it's just a nice addition to have the 8 megapixel camera on the rear provides you with average images from what you will see with the tablet
details are not that strong at all and also low-light isn't the best the images also have a layer of sharpness applied impost
sort of a lot of extra features are stripped out it just leaves you with timer gridlines and switching between cameras
it's fantastic to hold and it seems like it could stand the test of time also the processor that it used is no slouch
you want on there as well if you're in the market for an Android tablet and the international version becomes available
go ahead and press the like button subscribe to android authority if you like our content or any other are content creators and also
find the product and download the software by the way the core mini 7w is compatible with windows mac linux and also chromebooks
um it has a usb type-c port and yep the cable is really good guys and it's an l-shaped usb-c cable it is my favorite
it's really convenient to use l-shaped um chargers finally let's talk about the pen it's great to see good quality pens with small size graphics tablets
guys this is a new generation xp pen stylus it also has a rubber grip so this is super comfortable and it's heavy enough so i love the pen
it means it's fully charged and then we would like to blow here to show you that is on capital letter so all
and it's very thin and then it's sort of like magnetic what it does is that it just hang onto this cover very well
okay and then this is the front camera which they use to megapixel and at the back here this is also the back camera
I can just press it for it to download but I have not do it because I just want to quickly show you so for example
I want to download Subway's cell phone or just pressed it and if you can see it's just slowly downloading it for me right now
it is for my older son so he would like to have the YouTube but let me can stop this first
it means that it will help you to another selling point for this tablet is that it comes with this peep sorry
I don't want just say without tell without showing you so I have create a test document so like here I just write that okay
save it on your microSD cards for example and then if you want to print it you can also print it
I was just not going to print it now because I want to not be able to show you my printer so you can just straight me print it
I can link my drop off and then make them save it there or you can save it on your Google Documents
just save it okay and then you let me press new to show you so you can create document memo here and a presentation and a spreadsheet
okay let me get out first and then if you want to put in pictures and go to my apps this is the camera okay and when
I cannot find my camera because I need to go to the setting to approve the camera before the kids can even have it
okay let me sound to my next fix one of the good things for this tablet is to watch movie or any show so
we not putting any because I signed this up using my Google account and my kids able to check my calendar
you just can take off a few bits that you want them to use you know you just have to go to the management so
okay if you don't want them to see this you can take it all you can let me see if I wanted to go not letting them access this
okay press it so you can authorize when you want them to use this tablet so before travel call they cannot own it
okay we wanna turn on at all and then how many hours you can let them play like one hour to hour
according to pure is that they will so for the web filter and kill reassure parents that they are filtering is really really good
I'm using Dropbox or prefer that to save in my Dropbox but I haven't said it yet but you can eat at a moment
Google Playstore means that I can have a lot of different apps for for my kids to use and at the moment they can
really really nice and as you can see that the map the notification is responsive and then the app look quite quickly as how it should be okay
it's the same thing you just keep on the thing that you your kids want to find and then you will filter it and tell you that is it
this website is say for you your kids to assess it okay so you can see that this is a very nice set up for kids from all age
this also has a couple of minor issues but first let's just assess the whole package and see how she i mean it looks like.
as you open the package you first see the tablet inside and my first impression was definitely feeling the weight of it.
this pen claims to have a new pen tech 3.0 on it and it would feel more organic as you use it.
you also get two wires in the box one of which is a usb c to hdmi and two standard usb ports and also a usb extendable cable.
now if your power outlet and the cpu or the laptop are far off, this cable would help and you don't need to buy one yourself.
the biggest benefit of this size and the tablet is that if your pc or laptop supports a usb 3.1 gen1 with dp 1.2 data transfer protocol
even though my desktop does have a usb c input the failure to find a cable hampered my rocket launch efforts of testing that part.
if you plan to work on the tablet by carrying it on your lap then be my guest but you can definitely feel the weight of it.
i think you wouldn't ever need a dedicated space for this to store it when you are not working with it. just slide it in any of your drawers.
they have this matte protective layer installed on the display and the one i received had this little tear on the corner.
my emphasis here is that you really can't nitpick much when it comes to working and creating stuff with this tablet.
while trying shading and line art in photoshop with this you can also judge for yourself for how it is behaving on the screen
like in all other display tablets and as i have said in my previous videos it will always remain until screen panels are literally paper
but you would need to connect to the power source when trying to use this on an android phone but again make sure
anyway i tried hooking the tablet to my laptop and just the hdmi connection and the non-powered usb were enough to power it on.
i mean if i compared this to the previous versions they were even worse but the very slight variation was still visible here too.
but that is not a deal breaker at all as i know not a lot of users will be working on this with it lying flat.
and if you try to pick it up and work then you have to rely on the keys on the tablet and just forget about your keyboard.
many would actually wonder if the tablet has these restrictions that you have to hook up to a pc or a laptop and it's thick and it's slightly
you can buy the surface pro or the ipads pro if you're already accustomed to the ios app store or other things for your art creation.
well at least for a decent set of hardware which you might already own as a laptop or a pc or even a mac.
now the tablet goes for currently at the time making this video 80 bucks so it's going to be competing with other inexpensive tablets especially ones that run
here's a little walkthrough of sorts on how to use the tablet and what the buttons do and all of that you also get a manual which
but if you don't sure how to use the tablet it's gonna walk you through basically everything on how to use the tablet
it's not gonna be a powerhouse it's gonna be someone that wants to consume media and play some light gaming so let's check out a game
they actually don't sound that bad a lot of the Chinese type tablets that I've been checking out sometimes have bad sound
I don't even know what was asking me right there but I am totally killing it and you can see this game having no issues on this tablet
so if you like these type of games or you play like word games you know things that aren't super graphic intensive
Plus open that up real quick when you close that and I'll play a half a second of something in here
it is 1.9 megapixels or you can make it lower back camera you can record an up to HD 720p front camera on records in 480p
I said it gives you a little bit of customization with the navigation bar you can put a microSD for expanded storage to save
it seems fine on there so overall not a bad little tablet if you want to pick it up it is linked down below
an art teacher a professional artist and uh in today's video we'll be reviewing a tablet but not only a tablet
power cable some screws for the mount and then the panel holder with a bunch of nibs inside and then the pen itself
it doesn't look super super high quality but it's made out of metal for the most part i just kind of wish it was black
it's not like a plastic film on top of a regular glass surface now quickly if we look at the back of this thing here
let's just say it's portable-ish because is only one cable connecting to the wall and that's it which is definitely nice but yeah
let's just put it that way and then well when you boot this up for the first time we're going to be prompted to install windows 10
now let's take a look at this machine see if it fits any good and so to test the computer itself
i loaded up my version of pc mark 10 and then basically ran the you know the basic test to see where this computer stands
and it's kind of a bummer that this can be upgraded but it did not perform as badly as i thought it would
you know as soon as you get this up and running the integrated graphic cards drivers i mean because without it things were very very choppy
uh the fan does make a little bit of a noise especially when pushing the machine a bit more like like in z brush e3d software
uh express keys that you can configure and then two little sliders like to increase the brush size or something like that
but let's say i wanted like a quick character mock-up for painting or if i'm sculpting a prop or portrait or basically anything under 10 million polygons
well you can't right because it comes together or maybe what happens if the computer breaks and needs repairs or what if the display itself needs repairs
now with that amount of money would you be able to build yourself a pretty good desktop computer and then buy a canvas 22 tablet separately
the painting part which is important was really really good all right so this is going to wrap up the review
USBC will go to the tablet and this USB a will go to the computer the pen feels lightweight but solid enough
so that's a pretty weird because most other drivers they allow you to enter your own keys you can also use the driver auto shortcut button to open up
so there's this disconnect it's going to take some time to get used to in terms of drawing performance this pen
I can draw with my mouse which I am doing so right now but when I draw with the pen for some reason it just doesn't work
you just get used to the movement of the pan on the tablet and how that translate to the distance you will get onto the screen overall
the drawing performance seems to be quite decent except for a glitch with MIDI Bank paint Pro on the Mac at the time of this review
I'm not able to test this on Windows because my computer is at a repair center once I get my computer back
what is good to last up to two years on different types of usages but around two years in the end
I would say I would definitely actually recommend this device as it was actually a really helpful device for all you guys out there
there's only a couple downsides as not very good viewing angles and then again you guys have to always delete things completely
oh that's good that's like connected on there so that if you're kind of traveling you can wrap it up nice and neat again
Express keys our customizable buttons for keyboard shortcuts and application functions pen hover hover the pen over the surface to move the cursor tap
the pen tip to the surface of the tablet click register your products redeem your software sign in or create a
that's me there we go create a Wacom Wacom ID I still want to kill and wake up verifies so they sent in email so congratulations
Pro also offers easy to use advanced tools for any art style cool so I'm gonna add that to my library as well so here we are so
it's saying the front is a scroll but again by clicking here you could have that button there for anything you you like so you could
look if you go here and for some proportions then that means that the tablet is the same proportions as your screen
so you've got a lot of fine-tuning that you can do clips to do which I downloaded this looks like this
then you can up rate it in to us pro and some kind of major art package if you want to now icon sent this to me to review
I was clicking away all day and I found I was getting started to get RSI and pains in my arm

Brad Linder with little feuding and this is the Acer Aspire switch 11 which looks like an 11.6 inch notebook and it kind of is you can see
and the reason it's called the switch is not just because you can switch from tablet to portrait modes or tablet to laptop mode
but you can also go ahead and attach this backward and use it as a sort of stand-alone kiosk style system
another thing to bear in mind in terms of limitations is that it only gets about four and a half hours of battery life
Acer says you should be able to get up to six and a half and depending on how you use it
state drive this model is just a keyboard and USB port and a touchpad keyboard itself is reasonably comfortable for typing
let's go ahead and fire up some video and I'll talk a little bit about the screen viewing angles and other features mute
you probably want to plug in headphones or something else if you wanted higher performance audio so it interacts well with touch
I find that some things can be a little bit sort of awkward when you're using a two-in-one device like this it might get better with Windows
now that doesn't happen in every application but it does happen in some applications so there's still vestiges even though eight
I would consider this a medium size tablet it comes down to preference which one you like to me this is the
I think mostly because my pen never actually reaches that high and my wrist never go that high either so there really isn't too many opportunities for them
I get a tiny bit of way with those but nothing serious but overall I think the pen feels good for most folks
you're gonna find two different kinds of USB adapters one is a USBC adapter and the other one is a micro USB adapter
but since those bells and whistles don't work on Android and if that's all you plan on using it for it might be worth it
their lettering can be used by students to just you know jog down some quick notes or you know to just practice solving some mathematical equations or even artists
it's quite dusty and we also get a nice stylus over here so let's pop this out all right so this is how it looks as i mentioned earlier
i don't think you could ask for more and less than a thousand rupees and if it lasts one year or two years i'm happy with it
yeah okay and let's see how we can use these things so we can just you know if kids are using this
if i want to erase only a part of it now i should go ahead and clean up the entire screen
USB cable with a lender on 4 feet 2 USB adapter for smartphone usage vanston with 8 extra nib for future use
and lastly the tablet itself the accessories are minimal but with purpose the build quality of this tablet is very sturdy light and comfortable to hold
Android so you can connect it to your phone or tablet without installing any software and the in terms of design
so it's really helpful to have a tablet like this that gives you the freedom to do your work and I was using the mouse
but it smooth and accurate and there's also this one is the tear tutorial on do a lighting effect and here
so when you are by this tablet you can download this software from their website by mentioning your model number so this right now my model number is
H is 610 so I've done with this model and it's easily customized so when I press this kiss you get this Express
I have customize it for example right now over here I have convert this into command or control C and control V and
you get this open or closed bracket which to control the size of your brush and eraser and you have more buttons over here
that's all there are lots of other buttons but it depends on how you want to use it over here if you go to
you can change it easily by just clearing the string and just pressing it if you want to change it to erase it just press
E and it will be customized and click OK and apply it and it will be updated in your Photoshop file
you can adjust the pressure sensitivity over here so right now if I keep it to medium here you can like draw like this
I have been using this for two months so if you ask me how I feel about this tab that I think this is the perfect tablet for me
I think this is the best habit and if you were professional also I think this is best one like it's under budget
these are one of those tools that I'm most excited about having it as a creator it has increased my speed and workflow
I have shared a link in the description I have included the official link of huion website and the azan link
so if you have any questions please let me know in the comment section and thank you very much for watching
and of course everything in this review will be my own opinion as well as the actual specifications of the tablet
then there was the pen box which has a little plastic insert inside of it and the pen is inside of that
along with the nibs for the pen and the wireless receiver for using the tablet in the wireless mode so for the tablet itself
in as well you can use it wired or wireless and the wireless function worked really well for me there's 8192 levels of pen pressure sensitivity
PPS which is points per second and a 50 80 LPI which is aligned per inch from what I found online
it has a 11 by 7 inch drawing area and the whole tablet itself roughly eight and a half by 15 inches total
and the pen stand comes in two separate parts you can stick all the pendant inside of it and the wireless receiver goes inside the pen
suddenly after using a screen tablet for so long but after after a good couple minutes like maybe a half hour
so it doesn't like cut into your into your wrist when youwhen you have your hand rested over it the one thing
I found interesting was the Express keys are all fairly quiet except for one is really loud when you click it it might just be the one
I think this tablet is definitely worth the price if you're looking for something fairly large affordable and it just feels really nice to use
the the software that it comes with when you have to customize all the keys it's really easy to understand and use and it was also very responsive
I had a lot of fun using it and it just felt like a really nice good quality tablet especially for the price so
even though tablets aren't as popular as they once were and our phones are getting larger and larger having a dedicated unit
like this especially one which has a 10 inch display or above is still kind of a middle ground between a larger laptop and a smaller smartphone
it's used for the antenna bands we have the camera there is also a built-in LED flash as well which is actually for you
so it's fairly up to date and there's all the gestures like pulling up to access the full drawer for your applications
Google utilities access to Gmail YouTube Google Photos and of course the Play Store to download more apps and content to only cite strange thing though
as a for mention in our unboxing is there is an LED flashlight on the back that assists a camera under low light situations
and you can also use it as a torch if you really need to now talking about the battery life ever-so-slightly 5000 million of hours
but you probably shouldn't use it as your primary device so if we take a look at some samples here again for document scanning it does alright
I would definitely prefer using your own headphones since it has a standard 3.5 millimeter plug or I can use bluetooth if you want to improve the audio quality
everything still feels pretty smooth as far as navigation is concerned with these two apps open side by side there right now
it's also doing a pretty good job even though it's another very complex page now if we jump into settings very quickly here you can see indeed
let's say hours on end video streaming doing some light gaming and it never it gets really hot or uncomfortable to use
Amazon fire 10 however the fire 10 does have fire OS so if you aren't already invested in Amazon's eco system
okay so about tablet and gives you the model number of this and stuff like that and then you go to you so you got the soft
he has the multi window so you can actually do multitasking with this smart capture palm swipe to capture easy me and Derek share differ device maintenance
and so it's really interesting when you can find a good alternative to a Wacom Cintiq tablet and this is I think a really good alternative
Wacom tablets so this tablet I think in my opinion is just that it is a really good alternative to a Wacom Cintiq tablet and on the left side
I think you can change the Express keys if you wish to but just the way it comes is very useful in general
I just don't really find them very useful and even though these were on the left side so for me a person who draws with my left hand
I realized I could still use my keyboard to use whatever shortcuts I wanted so then it quickly changed in that
sure your computer your or your laptop have an HDMI port or a mini DisplayPort and I'm kind of stressing this
I thought it was a really good quality sturdy tablet I have no concerns with it basically what I was expecting and the pressure worked fine
Helion for the purpose of reviewing granted but I am very happy that I've been able to spend a week with this thing ok
so let's crack open this $40 beast and see what's inside after going out and getting the mail the first thing you'll be greeted with
it has an active area of a hundred and twenty one point nine by seventy six point two millimeters or four point eight by three inches
it's pressure sensitivity is doubled from what the 420 was going from 2048 to 4096 the report rate of the h4 30
we have a comfortable routing height at 10 millimetres it also comes with 4 press keys for you artsy types or people who use the buttons otherwise
aside next up we have a little piece of paper shaped like a CD that has instructions on how to download the drivers
I don't know it's a micro USB cable personally I use my own but yeah we also have 10 extra pen nibs as well as a pen nib remover
I'm a hover player so I don't really use those but if you drag hey free nibs and then to end it off we have the starter guide
I think a lot of players will like this tablet a lot especially people who are in the six-digit very high five digit range as of recording
you're gonna love it a big thank you to huion for providing me the h4 30p that you saw in the video and that
if you want to get an h4 30p for yourself the Amazon links are in the description and for my American viewers
huion has provided a discount code for 10% off when you check out on Amazon it's only valid until April 20th
looks great with a rich array of colors and a wide viewing angle but it's 1366 by 768 resolution leaves much to be desired
anyone considering the edge should spring for one of the pro models the added ram and processing power give performance a nice boost and the standard version 64 gigabyte
but let's get to what's most important the gaming experience while the edge isn't going to blaze any trails in terms of max performance
precise and comfortable controls the gamepad offers the most self-contained control method integrating controls into the rigid framework of the tablet itself
the d-pad and action buttons are directly below the thumbsticks requiring players to uncomfortably curl their thumbs inward to make quick taps while it's less problematic in some genres
the gamepad also adds extra weight and can be jarring to hold for extended play sessions in order to play comfortably
of course you could always forego the gamepad and connect a standard control to the edges USB port but without razor's $99 add-on dock
it's difficult to keep upright and really that cuts to the core of the edges problems in order to use it to play games
because they know that's where the users are at but some people still like a tablet for a bigger screen experience
be it gaming or watching something on YouTube or Netflix Walmart's in-house brand on just released two new Android tablets to the on 8 inch and on 10.1
I have right here the 10.1 inch on tablet and I've been living with it for a little over a week and let me just say I have thoughts
and the right light you can actually see random curves which makes me think plastic running your fingers over the touchscreen feels a bit more sticky versus what
but that's actually what they sound like now up on the top there's a volume rocker a power button a headphone jack and a micro
so you're gonna tap out on storage space rather quickly but go ahead and use the SD card slot for media storage
there is the device's Achilles heel which we'll talk about in a moment there's also a 3500 milliamp hour battery that charges pretty slowly but burns rather quickly
let's analyze each use case browsing the web is okay actually some swiping and browsing brings with it a little janky
actually little moments to slow down when tons of action was on screen at once but it made it through roblox
I think my six-year-old could manage but my nine-year-old has refined taste and robot's performance so I'm sure she'd pass basically simple casual games would be fine
anything with lots of complexity and action and graphics might fight to stay alive while running on the on 10.1 inch tablet next books and movies
Android and all of googles apps and services along with the Play Store Amazon super popular fire tablets offer a lot in the way of digital content
who the heck knows how often walmart plans to send out security updates or even full version updates when android q becomes a real consumer OS upgrade
I'm Jason Howell and I enjoy picking apart devices of all shapes and sizes on all about Android every week on Twitter
this video may be a bit long so if you want to save time you can check out the text review that i have already written
so you don't have to charge the pen anymore and this tablet also supports android so those are the main selling points
there's the light there and when your pen is hovering the light will also appear in addition to the 12 customizable shortcut buttons here
this is a good size to work with regardless of the size of the display that you are working with and on the right side here
there is the windows ink feature which you may have to turn on or off if pressure is not working as expected
this is the mapping area which you can probably leave at default unless you are using a monitor with a with an unusual aspect ratio
and it's able to turn very smoothly as well and now let's see if i can maintain consistent pressure without any variation to the thickness of the line
brush to draw thin and thick lines without the need to change to other brushes by the way the express keys or the physical shortcut buttons on the side
i prefer to use my keyboard for shortcuts so i don't really use them but they do work fine if you need them
i do this by drawing the boundary on the tablet so basically i drew a white rectangle here and that's mapped to this square here
i have the whole surface area to work with but this is a white format that's mapped into this vertical format so again the proportion
the proportion the mapping by the way i have tested this tablet with three android devices two samsung tablets and one xiaomi phone on the xiaomi phone
I got it took a little time to get used to it but once I got the handle of it I liked it
I was like the trackpad a lot - I was surprised at how responsive it was and you can change the sensitivity on it as well using Windows
Windows of course has a setting for this now just as taking off the screen if you try to pull it off in the middle
so you've got to go from either side to take it off relatively easy putting it back on it which was a little bit easier
it's not bad but once you have it in there you kind of know that you've got it in place and then of course
Windows sometimes gives you an audible alert as well just going to show you the last year a little bit quicker
so the web browser then went fullscreen and also the interface changes a little bit too so now if I personal the windows
this is 11.6 inch screen and it is kind of long when you go portrait but reading content is really cool in that mode
I want to point out here and bringing these here is that the 11.6 inch is really the productivity device the 8 inch is more of a consumption device
excuse me than the 8 inch otherwise the devices are very similar so certain internal components are the same right now obviously
life is going to be better overall on the 11 inch as well whereas the 8 inch does have some issues
it gives you a list of some of the important specs including the screen size the Wi-Fi the cameras and the internal component information
now we will notice that it does come with a pre fitted screen protector which is actually a nice feature especially considering
the overall feel of the tablet is that it is nice and sturdy it does look really sharp has a little bit thicker bezels than what
impact them in terms of the specs of the matrix pad it's got a 10.1 inch IPS display with a resolution of 1920 by 1200 pixels
some additional features that the tablet has is it does have a GPS antenna inside it does run Bluetooth 4.0 and it can connect to a 2.4
G or a 5g Wi-Fi network in terms of the actual visual aesthetics of the case when you're looking at the side of it it is relatively low profile
the design for the tablets a little bit unique all of the buttons and the controls are located on the top of the tablet
so if we take a look at the top of the tablet from the right hand side moving over to the left we have our power button
you've got all your basics like google assistant and you can download pretty much whatever app you want right from the
I personally tested it and I had no problem at all downloading any of the apps that I wanted including Netflix
so we're gonna put this through the wringer we're gonna run it on retroarch and then we're gonna run some standalone emulators now because of the specs
I've got a wireless controller connected to it so that way I can control it a little bit easier but you certainly could use the on-screen controls
running on this thing fairly decently so we're gonna go ahead and throw that into the mix as well before we get there though
Super Mario World and honestly the game is running really well also so I think that that checks off my boxes
retroarch is gonna be perfectly fine for things like your ate and your 16-bit consoles so seeing how well these two games run
that pretty much tells me that we shouldn't have any other issues with Nintendo Game Boy Game Boy Color Game Boy Advance Steven
I think that might have something to do with it but I just genuinely enjoy this game and the game runs absolutely flawlessly so
let's go ahead and take a look at another game the next game that we're gonna take a look at is
I think the experience is gonna be based on what kind of controller you're using but it does appear to be able to play it quite well
now we're gonna turn the notch up just a little bit and what we're gonna try to do is get some
I decided to try to run some PSP games on it and I do gotta say it was completely hit or miss
there were certain games that are notoriously hard to emulate for example the God of War games that would not run the FPS was dropping so low
you couldn't even get out of the main menu but then when I loaded up a few other games like LittleBigPlanet
you could definitely play it but it did have a little bit of slowdown but it was certainly something that could be worked with
but it's definitely good enough to play through if you want it to sit down and try it but that's pretty much all
I will have links to this in the description down below if this is something you're interested in and I really do appreciate the support
pricing between the two models is definitely going to be a little different for the standard edition with two gigs of ram
this is one of my favorite budget tablets coming in at 150 and $100 when it's on sale this has an 8 core 2 gigahertz
I mean if you want to get one of these for the kids so they can watch their Netflix on the road
I'm gonna go in here and just load up a video real quick and this is the Netflix version from the Amazon
no problems there so basically this is actually a great little media consumption tablet if you just want to view videos on
OpenGL on the new 2020 fire HD 8 plus 658 Vulcan 718 when we take a look at last year's version of the fire 8 it only supported OpenGL
so we do have a significant jump there but if we compare this to the 2019 version of the fire 10 HD OpenGL 1151 Vulcan 1108
Minecraft moving over to some emulation first up we have n64 using Lupin 64 + FZ performance is pretty decent and
moving up a little bit with PSP using ppsspp has tested a bunch of 2d games and they work fine with no frames get 2x resolution
i tested a bunch of games here and performance is pretty decent but there are some harder to run games like that are alive too
Amazon Fire HD or the HD plus we definitely have a big jump over the Amazon Fire HD 7 or last year's HD 8
and if there's anything else you want to see running on this new tablet just let me know in the comments below but like always
so this one we got for ourself and like i said when they have sales so worth it look at that mirror effect
it's pretty cool so we're going to go out and fill all the information that comes up all right so we went ahead and we loaded everything up
let's see those are games and apps books you got your home page and then you also have for you which they just pick stuff
we're gonna have to set our location and stuff but yeah with it linked to everything um you can see so much do so much
that's why i gave it to homestead tessie as a gift and this is definitely going to help with youtube and stuff related by the way guys
there is a way that you can get google play on here as well and what i highly recommend you doing is going to youtube
normally um christmas black friday those kind of times you can get better deals but definitely worth it at all price points
it's pretty standard to tamper-evident seals as well as the all-important spare screws you will probably need those so keep them for later
this is quite different to the crypto steal cassette and this is just the letters that come with the crypto steal cassette
I have also seen some folk who got very concerned that someone could deduce what your seed was based on the words
you've got all your letters for the first floor of each one and you'll notice for that last word that's only three little words so
I'll just Chuck put them in upside down as a blank because there are no blanks that I could see on these sheets
click and just like that up doesn't need to be SuperDuper tight and there you go so you got you twelve words and again
correct in what you've transcribed and if you've got a twenty four word seed you basically just do exactly the same thing again with this side here
you're done the whole thing just slides together and then if you want you can stick a ten tamper-evident seals on there
I'm really impressed that Kobo have managed to pull this off for the price point they have and if you look at Jameson
this doesn't really fare any worse in his extreme fire and crush tests than this one does and to be fair
beyond the kinds of stresses that this sort of thing is likely to encounter even in a house fire the other thing
I love with this one is it includes everything in the box that you need to put it in and again
I've actually said the crypto steel doesn't come with all the things you need to put it together whereas the Kobo tablet especially with their nifty
there is something to be said for having two or three copies of your seed backed up in a row bust way spread across multiple locations
Holdings so thanks to Kobo for sending this out to me and again as someone who's purchased other metal seed phrase backup storage mechanisms in the past
if you have any questions about this video or a topic that you'd like me to cover just leave a reply
so here will contact me a few weeks ago asking if I wanted to review one of the tablets for them and I was like
oh yeah and so the thing about the human brain is they're probably one of the worst well known for selling cheaper and more affordable tablets whenever
it's very very small so I have actually seen a few reviews of this tablet just online already and yeah every time people took our box they did
Express keys off onto the side here and they're quite there's nice real separation between the expressed keys and the actual tablet screen which is interesting
you have a bit of texture at the back and some kind of rubbery pads here just to make sure it doesn't slide around on a table
you have this side which connects to the actual tablet itself and then of course this will connect to whichever computer you're using now here
I have a little little sketch or balloon that I made a while ago so I've decided randomly that for every tablet reviewed I do
go to your character to draw and I think I'll be cool to have that a little bit of consistency across all the different tablet reviews
I actually ended up moving recording of this speed paint to my desktop Mac not my laptop size MacBook no my 27 inch TV size giant Mac
I could move the brush on the screen fairly accurately as I block scenic colors and just in regards to pen to brush correspondence moving tapping clicking etc
once you get in used to feel or pretty much any tablet your your set it just takes a little time and a bit of practice
I did end up using two of the expressed keys which were set by I devote to zoom in and zoom out
and it doesn't really add much weight or either and also think that will be the ideal situation for buying this tablet
it's perfect but if you're like me and you work at home on a giant screen trying to pump out art every week like it antisocial little robot then
I'll have links down in the description below to the huion website which will have all their of the products as well as this one
Orioles and all the other artsy goodness you can get in life and I'll talk to you all next time bye you
USB 3.0 port and a micro HDMI port on the other side here and those are built right into the the tablet
SD card slot stereo speakers on the side docking connectors for optional keyboards and other docks volume buttons our speaker and a micro USB port and headset jack
32 watt hour battery version gets around 8 maybe sometimes even more hours of battery life and with select docking stations
like the mobile keyboard dock you can actually extend your battery life to up to maybe 13 or 14 hours in terms of tablet usage
Firefox web browser you can also run Chrome and other applications and what I like to do when I'm running sort of full desktop style or notebook style
they're almost too small to tap if I wanted to use this with my thumb or with my fingers you can use a keyboard and mouse
but what we're doing here is we're sort of looking at what we would see on a device with a lower resolution maybe a 1366 by 768 pixel display
everything does look a little bit nicer because you have certain pixel doubling here so text and fauns and everything is easier to read
has a slightly slower processor has a lower resolution display but a significantly lower price tag and that might actually be a better option
well this here is the 350 dollar rugged keyboard accessory and it mounts magnetically just like it would with a surface tablet or any of Dell's more consumer-oriented tablets
believe me this one weighs about another two or so they don't have the speck on it but I can tell you it's pretty heavy
but the idea is that it is milspec rated for a variety of things including drops from four feet for dust humidity
Core i3 Core i5 core i7 or available we have the core i7 in our model and you can get with eight or 16
all the way up to a terabyte depending on what you want to spend money for it has Intel Wi-Fi 6 onboard a X 200
it's a little bit more about power savings here but this has plenty of battery capacity not so much of an issue and the swap old batteries as well
I think part of that is probably the waterproofing they've done to it more than just the anti glare now they say a thousand nits of brightness
uh-huh it depends on how high you drive that brightness though and you have something that goes to 887 it's according to our colorimeters measurements
the q11 key the wireless graphics tablet over the last few years I have featured a lot of Rhian tablets this company
I'm going to show you the qe7 key take a look at what's included inside a box list by the way
but even when it runs off battery you can just connect the charging cable to the sellers and you can still use it always charge charging so
let me show you what you can customize with the driver settings so there are several tabs here let me click on this which is called
pen setting you can customize their buttons on this slide again you can customize it to any keyboard shortcut that you want to
I am NOT able to drag this button here so I have to click on different areas to change the pressure curve
let me go on to this tab here so here you can map a specific area on the tablet to your screen
you can choose who area you can choose the aspect ratio and if you are left-handed user you just have to rotate it 180 degrees
and that's all there is to the tablet setting so let's open some apps to try out the stylus now all right so this part of the video
I'm drawing with a small and amount of pressure as I can to get the thin lines this tablet and the stylus
it's very sensitive that's 8,000 levels of pressure sensitivity so let me show you the strokes and how they taper the tapered white well compared to walk home
I think well probably has a smoother and well gradual taper as in this section here it tapers much more gradually
I do not really have any issues with the strokes they come out just the way I want them to this is Adobe Illustrator cs5 and
you have to go into the brush option and turn on the pressure so you can just double click your brush icon
the software will basically correct the stroke to make it even smoother so this is Adobe Illustrator let me switch over to pre-k I do not use this software
I'm not very good with this app so I'm just going to show you whether or not pressure works so it works very well
I thought I should mention is when you are at the locking screen of the Mac for example like this and you have other users so this is you
if you prefer a bit more texture than the one with more texture is actually the Wacom Intuos non-pro the one release in 2015
I see usually is within the first minute of me starting the app for example when I start up many bank painter
another point to take note of is since this is a wireless tablet you do need to use the wireless receiver when I first use this
even though this is 11 by 7 which is 1 inches larger on the top and the side well overall it feels much larger to me
we only make tablets of all sorts of sizes so you can check out their websites or if you want to get other sizes but overall pretty decent habits
if you have any questions let me know in the comment section if I have any updates to this review I would put that in the text review
then we'll switch over to me and actually using it on my computer and you know doing all little doodles and stuff which by the way
this seems to definitely be all a one-time-use thing because some of that stick material did come off this slider on out here and whew
there's a supposed to be some like button things which in there photos look the way more like obvious than here in real life
but yeah that's the touch pad area right over here you have the actual USB slot which is on the side which is very welcome
I've already downloaded so we can go straight to that part so before you install you have to make sure you actually plug it in
Pend configuration which allows you to choose the pen pressure and you can adjust the sensitivity of the pen pressure as well as the little buttons
all right here you see me testing the print pressure but you can also use this to adjust what those two buttons do
next thing you have is your mapping this is what part of your monitor is going to be selected by or being used by the tablet
but you can see what each one is you have k1 k2 k3 k4 all that stuff and you can set each one to whatever you like alright so
I wish they had made them a little bigger or like more pronounced cuz like I can kind of figure out where that is the buttons
I cannot create a circle to save my life with this thing I am not used to these types of tablets
I can kind of work something together like I said it feels nice in the hand actually like it really does
yeah you can see you can actually get fairly smooth with it like there's no real jitter at all like yeah there's no jitter at all in that
because this world ler is not perfectly straight so yeah all in all my impressions of this are that it's a really good solid tablet
it feels really nice like it feels it has like a very subtle texture to it which is really nice the only critique
Bluth you know a blue little plus sign clip that and put like a marker around that little touch pad area other than that
give it the thumbs up if you want to see more of my content that make sure you subscribe for more content
I don't care about that as so as long as the product can make the can do the job that I needed to do
let me show the tablet what it looks like and let's get sketching now before we get into the sketching part
just make sure you hit the subscribe button if you haven't already that way you get notified when new videos are uploaded every single week just
Before we jump into the who yawn before we before I show you the tablet that we're going to be checking out today
that didn't have a lot of money but I knew I wanted one of these and I wanted it in black so this is a Wacom Intuos
I wanted it in black and I've had this since 2007 and it is pretty worn out but it still works great
I still love it and I use it to this day but as you can see the biggest issue that I had with it
I'd be happy to because I'm sketching a lot and I can use it on my channel and show you guys what it's all about
you just need to have the passion for sketching and once you're comfortable with pen and paper that's when you can take it into digital
if you want to do that it doesn't really matter but what we're gonna do now is jump into the tablet
I'm gonna show you the unboxing of it and then show you all the buttons cables and what comes with it
a box and on the side you can see all the main features of the tablet and what you can expect from it and also
it comes with in this plastic box and when you open it up you can see that it has a screen protector covering the screen as well
I may or may not have installed the foot the wrong way around that the first time but all the hardware comes with the tablet
it's not just a tip but it's a warm tip to you to remove the plastic cover from the tablet before you start working on it
you use to setup your display to whatever color settings and kind of tones that you want the display to have personally
I'm used to and you can see here that Rosie also likes to chew on these pens so you can see her
I don't really use this at all but I guess you can customize it and figure out some function for this if you want to now obviously
I didn't want you to miss the moment when I took advantage of the warm tip and removed the plastic cover
I don't like my hand to cover a large portion of the sketch which it does when using a display tablet with a regular tablet
I get a better overview of what's going on in the sketch without having to move my hand off the tablet
new for this is the tilt function of the pen and that the pen itself is now battery free for all the facts of figures
I've had nothing but great communication with the fine people at Hui on and I'm actually really happy that there are companies like this
that are taking a piece of the tablet market after all it makes for better competition better products and in the end more affordable product for all of us
these lights were working fine and they turned off when i enabled power saving mode but now they just won't work entirely next
also in the previous build the operating system would randomly restart sometimes for no reason but since 2nd of november update

it really is cheap and I thought that it may not offer great features in quality but I was wrong once I got the Fire HD 10
I realize that this town is not only the most affordable but it's a top-notch tablet to the Fire HD 10 is designed for anyone
no matter the purpose it delivers great quality and amazing performance despite the price the screen ratio is perfect for watching videos
but as you may know the camera is not the main thing that we look for on a tablet the first thing that caught my eye when
I spend a lot of time researching this one and I came to the conclusion that despite the average graphics performance this tablet is worth it
you should definitely check it out although it's best for multimedia this tablet can complete different tasks and you can use it for different purposes
it doesn't include a kickstand which is not good because I often binge watch TV shows and the kickstand helps me a lot
the cameras are not bad on this one though it comes with a 5 megapixel front facing camera and an 8 megapixel rear camera
you should definitely take a look and see if these tablets is the one you're looking for at number three it's the faces zenpad s8 the asus n bad
I did a lot of research on tablets lately and this one really provides great qualities using this tablet changed the way I see tummies
it's the Huawei media pad m5 as you may know while we did a great job when it comes to smartphones lately
simple design great performance and many other features other things that make the tablet lovers consider by the media pad m5
the display on the other hand is great over seven millimeters thick and has a 16 to 10 screen ratio but although it has very fast
Samsung already is one of the best when it comes to smartphones home appliances and technology in general and when it comes to tablets still
even though it's a cheap tablet it has two super solid cameras in the front it has a five megapixel and on the back in the eight megapixel camera
this tablet uses USB type-c for charging and the battery lasts about 13 hours which is pretty good despite the fact that it's a budget tablet
I realize that it really helped me a lot even though I haven't used it for a long period of time
I'm sure that the Galaxy Tab a 10.1 is very durable and can last you a lot more than you expect
Lenovo Tab 7 essential review by the way the Lenovo Tab 7 essential as a successor to the Lenovo Tab 3 7 essential
7 there's also a Lenovo Tab 7 HD with a bit better specifications in some countries that one is called lino would have four seven all right
all the way on the top is a microUSB port and a 3.5 millimeter audio jack on the left side sets a micro SD card slot
it certainly cannot loud enough to fill a back room and that maximum volume especially voices sound a bit scratchy next to the single speaker
we get a 2 megapixel front-facing camera and the main camera on the back features the same resolution again as you can expect at this price
let's take a look at the display of Si Lenovo tab 7 adventure in fact this is one of the highlights of this tablet
so there's no gap between the IDs panel and the touchscreen unlike seen your iPad or the 7-inch Amazon fire overall
one downside is that there does not seem to be any kind of coating to reduce fingerprints and it is certainly not the brightest screw in either
alright let's continue with the hardware and performance and this is a major weakness of the Lenovo Tab 7 essential with the Wi-Fi version
however if you have the 8 gigabyte version there's not much room left to install apps well as you've seen my benchmark comparison
gigabyte of ram into the dead 2 is kind of playable as well but only at those graphics settings and again with occasional lagging all right
I don't think anybody expect to get a nice gaming tablet at around $80 and indeed the tablet is usable for very simple apps
yes you can surf around simple websites but as soon as you open several tabs you might have to wait a bit until everything is loaded actually
that might be possible under certain circumstances maybe in airplane mode however in my standard very test the tablet lasted for 10 hours
it's great too that you can use the HD version to make phone calls and send SMS however the performance is just too bad
what's up guys crypto renegade here again with Bitcoin lockup and today we are going to do an unboxing video of the Kobo tablet
so basically what this device here is and we're gonna unbox it in just a second here so that you can see it
well what happens if my piece of paper gets lost it gets damaged or if something happens and I completely can't find it and it's just indiscernible
I sell through my website here and that I that I reference in some of my reviews such as the billfold
that's just an extra level of security so this is a very very nice device and I can't believe it's only thirty nine dollars to get it
so that if something god forbid happens you will have a very solid backup for your recovery seat and for all of your crypto so
so that's what this here's for is basically an insurance policy on your entire bank vault of crypto so very very interesting very high quality highly
I take the rest of this out it's a very nice presentation comes with everything that you need so it actually has a pull out instruction manual
this one is laser etched so it is very very clean very very easy to use so basically what you'll do is you'll locate the letters
you'll unscrew it here and then it will slide out and I'm not gonna do it right here on this video
so if that's not a good enough reason for you to need one of these things for only thirty nine dollars to have a complete
if there's anything specific you want to see let me know and I'll include that in the next video but just wanted to do this unboxing from Kobo
lenovo's tried since the helix and the helix was always a little bit of a Frankenstein product with this very strange and complex bottom fans that were built in
ThinkPad pro pen which normally cost 50 bucks 40 bucks if you're buying it separately and you get something like the ThinkPad x1 yoga
this pen always ships with this little plastic doohickeys here and this goes into the USB 3.0 port yes the depth tablet does have one of those
so that's actually the standard capacity of a laptop charger but in this kind of rip style here instead of a little square
it doesn't flex much although if I twist it a little bit I can make the stand pop out a little bit
I took off the two visible screws on the bottom and behind the kickstand and started prying the back off and it came up at the display panel
that part is very easy but after that it gets very stiff so the idea is that it stays solid on the table
but you have to open up about that much before it works so for those people want to draw on it
it's sturdier than the surface pro 4 which is a bit more flexible for those of you who find surface pro 4
sure a less travel than you would find on a think pad X 260 or something like that but it's good the back is rubbery and grippy
if you like or you can put it up like that and maybe suggests you could try to find an intermediary
it's a little laptop so the law damage is much simpler and less contraption like then the ThinkPad helix was certainly
it's a pretty clean lucky you got your Pogo connectors right here to connect to the keyboard and this little lever
one of them is the product tiffany module if it adds five hours of additional battery life it has a battery in the thing that plugs into the bottom
those which need of course alternative if you get that productivity module that also has a one link+ dock for Lenovo's dock adapters
there that's one of the two stereo speakers mini-displayport so pretty much mirrors the portside surface pro for has but it throws in that
it's not one of those ones you press and hold to turn it on so turning it upside down in the bag conk
that's pretty decent with a flash and there's a 2 megapixel camera in the front this one nice thing about two and ones that are more tablet
CPUs those are the lower power fanless cpu so for those of you had a helix that was always a huffing in a chopping
Core M of course is has less horsepower than Core i3 Core i5 and they fall somewhere in between the core M CPU sub for light work
I saw a lag when drawing and it really got in the way by being able to draw but some lighter programs like ArtRage for example
SSDs inside they are SATA 3 interface not PCIe nvme SSDs you can get with a 256 gig like ours or a 512 gig SSD for the CPUs available
and by the way we have 8 gigs of ram also in ours costs about 1350 and that includes the keyboard and the pen so this is not cheap
bench 328 to 27 for the single core 50 78 for the multi-core test if you want to compare that to a core i5 sky like generation
not really so much and for those of you who are also considering a surface pro 4 here so you can see them
this is pretty pretty good and pretty natural right here and it's doing a nice job of blending in my colors
if you keep going you get a little bit of lag and if I want a light line light and fin heavy line works well
I would show you clip studio paint but there is a pen offset of about three inches for some reason than that program
so that's not going to work out so I'll try to show you the free version of mischief instead and there you can see
but not always but after it keeps up with not too much leg that that's certainly very very usable if I was drawing

a 16 gigabyte version of 32 gigabyte and a 64 gigabyte version runs a 1 gigahertz dual-core processor and has one gigabyte of internal ram
it is quite a bit smaller than the 9.7 inch ipad 2 but for the PlayBook it does really feel nice
HD video so you can actually get some good quality images out of this does have a microphone up the top there on the top
it's nice and smooth so when you're watching videos it doesn't lag and work for the processor and the 7 inch screen does work well
we really did put a lot of thought into creating the OS they did create the OS from the ground up for the playbook so it really works well
they didn't re-engineer an existing an existing software package from their BlackBerry's so that works really well and it is suited to the 7-inch tablet
the screen is really is very good in terms of sensitivity the building edges around the black screen are touch sensitive
there's obvious reasons why they don't and they state them very clearly but for your interest to the users experience is a huge tick of approval
and if you're going to be serving a lot of websites with flash content then a blackberry playbook is perfect for that and it really does work
the 32 gigabyte is for six hundred ninety dollars and the 64 gigabyte version is nine hundred dollars in australia in the u.s.
Taylor's in Australia and also in the US so to summarize I really enjoyed using the blackberry playbook the 7 inch size real wasn't problem for me
I do prefer the slightly larger I've had two sides and if I show you a comparison that's the sort of size difference there as you can see
it might be a little bit expensive over six hundred dollar mark in australia for the 30 16 gigabyte version and the only last point
it's got foam up top so the screen is protected while it's in the box one thing I'll say is it is not
the first one was definitely a return because it wouldn't power so as we had it backwards in the box but anyway it's right here
because if you're holding it this way you can definitely smudge up and mess up your camera but and your charging is on the side so actually all
which is one of my favorites kind of assault circuit and what that are happening is when it told me to set as default
one controls you got your menus etc etc and I mean it's it's a fairly smooth experience and for reading comics
I didn't actually even try it out because the next point I'd like to cover it doesn't have Google Play now
I really do you sure you guys like subscribe and check out t3d techcom for reviews and all kinds of other fun tech stuff
I will be making a lot of comparisons to the regular x1 carbon because I believe if you're looking at this tablet version
the only thing you got to know about is it attracts a lot of finger prints so you'd be constantly wiping this down
it's very comparable to the x1 carbon but it's slightly lighter and slightly thinner so if portability is of the utmost importance to you
goes up to 160 degrees giving you a lots of tilt to write or sketch on it now since we're talking about writing and sketching
Excel if you're writing a document you're gonna feel like you have a lot more screen real estate in terms of color accuracy
which is great if you're using an int albert form factor but a little awkward when you're pressing it in laptop form not the biggest deal but something
you're not gonna be filling up an office with this and you're definitely gonna want to be using headphones if you need a louder audio
so these will kind of rotate as you go but that is generally the only invasive thing that you'll see if you don't want ads
it looks like or feels like but the back is a lightweight plastic so it feels a little nicer on the front versus the back
but they're located on only one side of the device so if I've got it set up like so right now where the speakers are on the bottom
let's take a look now and see how it performs so performance on this one is definitely improved over the prior edition
AC so you've got decent Wi-Fi potential with this as well and overall I was pleased with just how fast everything feels on this
I'm working through the device here so you even get some of this picture and picture stuff that you get on the iPads as well so all in
you'll get the video playing here at varying degrees of speed but it looks like a pretty lousy day out there
it really feels nice and smooth and I think if you've got kids that are playing a lot of these mobile games
let's load up the ppsspp emulator and see how it does with that so this emulator is emulating the Sony PSP which was Sony's original handheld device
we compared it to last year's model and as you can see here we're coming in more than twice as fast on that particular benchmark everything is running faster
I think the performance on this is very very good and something that casual Android gamers will enjoy some of those Android games
given the load it puts on the processor but I think a lot of casual tasks like web browsing and doing some Netflix or Amazon
I think it's not going to be spectacular from its overall physical design with the plastic backing here in these huge bezels
I am quite happy with what they are offering consumers for a very reasonable price this one also comes with a longer warranty than their smaller tablets
I'm sort of ship if you're not realizing it doesn't just hold it sideways like that you can actually poke it in and it holds it vertical
it's sort of hard plastic and one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve different buttons on the side
so you can set those two hot keys to whatever you want and there's also all these numbers along the top and
that's fine awesome digital pin okay so the digital pin you can select what buttons you want the side buttons to do here
I know one thing I can draw really well as eyeballs because I've drawn a million of them says to zoom in a bit
this was all this video was live streamed on my twitch channel so the link will be in the description ok
we'll be breaking down some of its functions and seeing if it lives up to all the hype design upon taking the knobby
it is not sunken at all so if it directly knocks the edge of something it will take the full hit basic features
the knobby 2 has quite a few functions and features but right now we'll cover how some of the more basic ones worked screen graphics and interface
the sound quality is good but the speakers are located in the back of the device so sound is directed away from the user rather than forward them
load time responsiveness because the Nabi 2 has one of the best processors out there for both kids and adults alike tronics
it should be able to stand up to some of the most demanding functions that can be asked of it and it should respond fast
whether you were starting up a graphically intense game or downloading music the time it took to get things up and running was impressive spinned
it also comes with a demo of a tilt sensor game with 8 gigabytes and an SD card slot for memory expansion
you got usb type-c port for charging you got speakers on both sides and you actually have the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
this is a 10.1 inch display with 1920x12 resolution which is going to be a very good picture not quite 4k
now this tablet is basically going to be your entry level so if someone has never probably had a tablet which most people have
if you want to play a game um i don't have a lot of games on here because i don't do a lot of gaming on my tablet
um gameplay looks nice looks fluid i'm just gonna do one little thing just to show you guys that this does work
you're just going to swipe up from the bottom revealing all your commands and press that to go back home so speed wise
so it's it's a decent decent buy guys for the average person like i said the person who is not looking for something to be a powerhouse
can't go wrong and it has a great price behind it as well so hopefully this is able to help someone out until next time
the compact and feather is shotsie with the IP 58 certification and the z2 tablet becomes one of the most well engineered mobile devices
out there you can dunk it in up to 5 feet 1.5 meters of water for more than an hour and it won't skip a beat
thus sir the thick side bezel is not aesthetically pleasing but since it brings added comfort when working with the z2 tablet
that same keys on one of the remarks we have about the side buttons as it feels rather wobbly under your finger
the end result should be more vibrant colors on the display yet without the accompanying of a saturation of OLED screens
which still aren't gory to look at the Kelvin temperature is very close to the reference port so white is spot on some may scoff at the 223
you can add more apps and widgets either from the tablet or from the Play Store they hover on top of anything else
one offers an LTE 3G modem while the other is Wi-Fi only both of them share the same radios Wi-Fi Bluetooth 4.0 sister GPS
so that you can use it as control free of TV or home stereo for example but not your AC unit like with Samsung or LG devices
the technology is known as active noise control and weeds out the ambient fluff like car train noises and busy streets
it also sports a plenty of settings like loop mode or subtitle support the footage looks pretty on the vibrant display
its in line with what one would expect from a 8 megapixel shooter snapping against the sky as the background results in underexposed frames
the device is quick to adjust the exposure when you are panning around with it and doesn't skip frames or insert add effects
it makes a striking first impression to anyone who grabs it and can even be held with one hand without wrecking your wrist too much
the lack of premium materials on a chassis is more than offset to buy the tablets of waterproof certification which makes it stand out in the Android crowd
compared to other high-end devices in its category sorry price the tablet at about $500 or euros for the basic 16 gigabyte
Wi-Fi model that's the same pricing scheme as its main Android and iOS competitors Samsung's Galaxy Tab pro 10.1 and the Apple iPad air
Apple's iPad air is also very soon lighter with a striking aluminum design plus half a million tablet tailored apps to choose from
I've made that decision as easy as possible by creating my list of the top nine tablets to buy in 2020
I'm Aaron Rutten and it is my mission to help artists like you enjoy digital art and learn about the latest digital art gear
the one is about as basic as it gets for drawing tablets it lacks many of the advanced features of the other tablets in this list
it still offers the same top-notch drawing experience as the more expensive tablets that we'll look at in just a bit but one by
I'll share my opinion on that near the end of this video when number 7 pick is the Wacom Intuos Pro second generation medium or the large version
the pro pen - which has over eight thousand pressure levels and can support pen tilt which gives you more control over the shape of your brush for example
we'll be looking at tablets that have a built-in display that you can draw directly on to coming in hot at number
and it's a tablet with a built-in display you can draw directly on to while there are advantages to drawing on a display
Wacom which doesn't have a screen so don't feel like you need the most expensive tablet to be successful at digital art now
Wacom one does not support touch while most Android art apps are built for touch devices but I do believe that
the most notable distinction is that the Cintiq 22 comes with a stand whereas the Cintiq 16 has fold-out legs with an optional stand that must be purchased separately
Wacom one but if portability is a concern the Wacom one does have an advantage by being more low profile than the Cintiq s' which are much bulkier
these tablets offer features that are probably only going to matter to artists who make art for a living even if these models are out of your price range
I think it's still helpful to see what they offer to get a better idea of what you should expect from a more affordable tablet
I've chosen the Wacom mobile studio pro 13 and 16 second generation the mobile studio pro is essentially a Cintiq pro
here the mobile studio pro is also battery powered which makes it perfect for artists who like to work outside the studio
and if that's what you're used to then the mobile studio pro might feel a little sluggish in comparison you're trading performance for portability
so if you don't need to make your studio mobile then save some money and get the Cintiq pro 16 and a nice computer or check out
it feels great to be able to work on a large image on a large screen and see every detail without having to zoom in
we're still at number 2 so I guess not my main gripes about the Cintiq pro 24 and 32 are the size and the fan noise now
this is probably a surprise to some of you but I actually like the Cintiq 27 q HD slightly better than the newer Cintiq pro 24 or 32 sure
I like that the Cintiq Pro has a better screen with a higher resolution and is compatible with USBC but I'm freakin
yes there is such a thing as too big 27 inches feels right to me and I can live with q HD resolution and only 2,000 pressure levels
I created a lot of my early work with only 1000 pressure levels so I know it's not a factor that's going to hold anyone back
Cintiq 27 q HD touch so higher pressure levels can be an advantage in some cases but for the most part
which can magnetically talk to the bezel and it requires one USB a connection for data and a video connection through either HDMI or DisplayPort
Wacom ergo stand but without support for screen rotation or you can purchase an inexpensive VESA adapter and connect an Ergotron arm which does support screen rotation
Cintiq 27 q HD touch in working condition snatch it up even the non touch version would be great if you don't think you need touch
Wacom release a 27-inch Cintiq pro but until that happens the Cintiq 27 q HD touch is my top pick for drawing tablets in 2020
the side has a plastic wobbly button such as a back button and volume rocker and the top has a power button headphone jack mic
all work to just it runs on 512 mega RAM and this is not sufficient or optimized in any way for doing anything
and the touch response is slow and not very sensitive or fluid in any way the Android version running on the device is 4.4
kingroot and purified is to eliminate bloatware that damages the UI several times and clean these programs several times a week
I have to use a browser in it that comes with it or install Chrome just to get videos to look better
don't expect it to last more than one day without charging it the charger it's shipped with stopped working after about four months it does have a gyroscope working
circular number zero then even buy it for a child they would throw it at you and you will be hospitalized
share this video and subscribe to this channel for more videos just like this and hopefully no more bad reviews to depend what I'm looking at
I've been doing an Ecco series for over a year and a half now with the Fire HD tablet gaining so many voice and echo features
HD tablet at the time of buying this the Fire HD 8 was on sale for $49.99 which was down from $79.99
which is a great price something to note that you might not be aware of at this price is that you are buying an amazon subsidized device
life is up to 10 hours of reading music watching videos or web browsing in the box you get the tablet a USB cable and a charging brick
that would be great for kids or is a device to leave lying around the house when you power on the tablet you're greeted by
Amazon's native apps that include Kindle books audible Prime video music photos and more there is an Amazon App Store to download other apps too
I use are Hulu Netflix and PlayStation View for social media you can find Facebook message or Instagram and Twitter snapchat
the device reminds me of when the iPhone and iPad came out and there was no Microsoft Google apps and other apps
I see it as a great tablet for kids to play games on or watch video and this is a good content device for really anyone
you know it's still a little bit duller than I'd like it to be but it definitely made some improvements here to make it very usable actually
it would have been nice if they got rid of this like sticky here with all this information on and put it on the bottom but nevertheless
I'm impressed with the build quality port before you paying for the device so it's also coming with the bit of chamfering as well around the edges
I'd say you should spend a little bit more if you want to do a little bit more with the the device like
which isn't going to be enough for most people but what you can do with that to actually go into the disk cleanup facility which
I have already done actually and I'll get rid of previous versions of you know windows which will be clogging up space previous versions on this
that risky of it and everyone teases everyone cheats as well so confirming each in patch actually then kills here see
Diagnostics we can see that usually the apt on X 5 processor handles things pretty well here in terms of you know we're keeping the device relatively cool
I wouldn't even bother you know you can see I've done some gaming and it hasn't really affected the battery too much so all in all you know
Lenovo and yeah hope you enjoyed the video if you're looking at this device and I hope you found it helpful and I'll see in the next one Cheers
I did a review on the tab ma HD and these are not the same tablets two days after I made the video on the HD version
they announced the FHD so I figured I'd go ahead and pick it up and I actually got this for cheaper
they're exactly the same size they look exactly the same - the colors as for the specs on the m8 fhd for the CPU
this is an octa-core CPU for a 53 course at 2.3 gigahertz and for a 53 course at 1.8 for the GPU we have the power
when it's formatted correctly it needs to be a exFAT to use a 2 terabyte card and the tablet is running Android 9.0
but there's a few apps that can't be deleted like the lenovo support app and the dolby tuner so as the user experience goes with this little tablet
HD in multi core because we have eight cores instead of four but the Amazon Fire HD 10 destroyed us in both of these tests
I just couldn't get this test around the fire 10 HD so the last two tests we saw were CPU benchmarks
I also ran a quick Wi-Fi test over my AC network 285 down 22.5 up overall really good speeds here now sign for some native
everything's on load just like a tested with the MA HD and we're still experiencing some lag here even with more cores and a higher clock in the CPU
it performs really well on here at the low settings it surprised me on the ma HD and it's also doing a great job here
works great but this is an easier one to run but if we try to run something a little harder like
I've also tested steam link and NVIDIA GeForce now but I've been using Project X cloud a lot lately streaming from their servers
it's really hard for me to recommend this especially at the 160 dollar price tag if this was sitting at 99 bucks and you need something for game streaming
and if you buy it from there you can get a five percent additional discount so the discounted price will be around sixty thousand to sixty one thousand rupees
only and you can use it to get five percent discount on any of the exception tablet but the discount code will be valid
let me just quickly unbox it and i will tell you its features and everything so there is another box inside this big box
i will tell you its features later on in the video and you can adjust the angle as well like this
then we will use the tablet in the box you will find some important cables which are required to use the tablet
you get an otg connector and you can attach this to the tablet so that you can place the pen like this then
so as i said the power connector the hdmi cable and the usb type-c that's it it's screen size is 21.5
according to your need let me quickly show you three features of the red dial you can assign up to five functions to each dial
I haven't had any videos on it or I have a written review just yet because the operating system the remix operating system has been in
I've kind of left my tablet for a while just to run a few of those updates and get things working fine on the teller and overall
really really good nice colors very nice and bright too and overall really quite impressed with the build quality to of the tablet
SD card slot very nice and very much like the surface where you have the slot hidden under the the flat there for the kickstand
maybe because it's a black color here so you can see already a little bit of dust there and minor things
I find the feedback on these keys are a lot better and I can just hop a lot quicker and then really just decent decent typing experience
which would turn the screen off and it does sometimes come off like it was quite easy if I hold it up for it to do that
CPU now that we do have an Android powered tablets but I must say that the performance of it is it's fine it keeps up with everything
it's really quite good and the operating system and as you did quite a bit of multitasking so you can run different
and if you imagine you're in the browser here and you want to just add up a few sums then you can do that
you can disable the trackpad - if you wanted to if you found that annoying and you can just certainly push a button there which would disable the trackpad
there as a haptic feedback when you push the home button then you can hear that vibrate and the power application is another very nice nicely
I just played a little bit if it sits down there I will show you a couple of benchmarks but first
and just let you hear these speakers here so you have our left and right speakers on the side here they actually do sound quite decent
some people might be concerned that that timber for being a kind of an old ala chipset might not be up to it
well that was just a little bit of a graphics glitch that I took a screenshot or just to to let them know about that
but for average use and gaming you're not really gonna have any you and I have any problems at all with that
that everything's everything was just fine on the tablet and I roll just to quickly wrap this review up here that I'm really quite impressed with this tablet here
I think the remix is a really nice Android tablet and I don't think there's anything that really comes close to that
it's got a detachable keyboard and it comes with an active pen for pressure-sensitive input but there are a couple of key differences
so there's seven different color options and if you prefer one over the other you can just sort of keep it that way or you can create function
the keyboard also has a couple of weird quirks here so for instance the V is like the V logo for the tablet and instead of backspace
and if we look at some of the functionality or some of the ports here we've got a 3.5 millimeter audio jack
it did work just fine that time so it can be a little bit finicky but it's also the power button one complaint
but a little bit dual microphones and at 799 when you get a device with AK or m3 processor which is a low-power processor
Eve tech for purposes of review and it features a Core m77 Y 75 processor which is the top-of-the-line Y series processor
you will notice that you get some black bars when you go fullscreen on a 1080p video like we just did and there
it's I think some people like like the 3.2 inch screens because they make it relatively easy to use a device both in portrait and landscape mode
they wanted to make available to people who wanted more performance but didn't want to sacrifice the battery life in terms of battery life
which if you extract late that should be up to nine hours of streaming video and possibly even more if you turn off
the fingerprint sensor is a nice feature to have the kickstand works pretty well like a lot of devices in this category
because if you went into the display settings and we're to try to use 100% scaling everything would look incredibly tiny
I do like to have sort of two side by side windows and I think 175 works a little bit better for being able to fit
and if you wanted you actually have options all the way up to 300% scaling which honestly looks a little bit silly to me now that
they're fact that they're sort of making a selling point out of the fact that they listen to their community is intriguing if nothing else
Yuting calm in the written review for this device but I think I think it's a little bit overkill to get 512 gigabytes of solid-state storage on a device
I just kept the extra cable tied up for the plastic tie it had come with another downfall is that the N 708 one properly battery in the pen
it is making it easy for carrying around the light in the kita in the middle of the expressed keys was a major annoying it flashes the whole time
it's a shame because the windows version of the driver allows for rotation and a whole lot more the response after pressing an Express key is fast
you pro when drawing the straight line slowly in photoshop when drawing straight lines are fast speed however there isn't any noticeable jitter at all but when
I noticed I got less juicer than my Wacom ubar Studio Pro so just so will generally vary between program to program
I have heard of other tablets which sometimes need unplugging and re-plugging so I'm glad I have no issues of this
this won't be a problem for many as a dedicated n 708 user probably won't be using another pen tablet alongside with the m7 or a
however what if you wanted to use weapons expressed key remote or maybe the cheaper alternatives the AC 19 remote by XP pen
I also tried installing the driver on my old XPS 12 and finally moving all drivers to be somewhat more challenging
I want a video but I made to help anyone who is stuck and can't get rid of the installed risers on their computer
UI will be accessed from small shortcut icons on the path bar the settings for the M 708 is far more comprehensive on Windows
I could set one of the Express keys to rotate which I couldn't on my macbook pro but it is an essential shortcut that I use
for example if I press undo a maybe zoom in shortcut button on the end 7:08 it immediately translates on screen with no lag whatsoever
it seems to be clear about the tablet devices which come with their own crush level pen such as the two
testing window showed similar results to Mac and as I mentioned before all tablets including walk-ons have a degree of jitter just some time
and maybe the cursor spasms some tablet window users may possibly experience it actually works really well and for the price it is
I started out with trusts tablet which was junk but at the time it really helped me transition from Mouse to pen
if you're not already subscribed consider doing so to watch more art related videos from myself until my next video bye you
of course i'm just gonna get this down so what you create it with this a little open something like this actually
uh but it's quite flat so it's quite sleek like starting your back or some backpack something so that's quite cool
there's nothing outside it uh so at first i was quite worried but then it seems like this is actually quite sturdy so quite nice
i just put this side boom okay so what we have here is the power cable the big power brick a bunch of papers
uh find somewhere to put them there you go the power brick off to the side there you go okay so now
you can kind of see the heatsink from the inside like so and then we got a gigabit ethernet jack now
i do like it and let's take a look at the bottom because i'm actually really excited to see the bottom
actually it's kind of shiny this kind of a kind of a green type of sparkly stuff inside if you can see
it has legislative focus a legion kind of logo on the side which is actually really cool so now the outside is finished
ah beauty let's just put this aside brilliant so now what we have here is just the lenovo laptop itself uh from first impression without touching it
weirdly is located in the middle and we have of course a bunch of speakers you know you get the east supports you
yeah it's really feels really nice to touch this and let's see if any deck flex there is a certain amount but it feels alright
uh and i'll do a more in-depth review of later be expecting that so make sure you're subscribed so you don't miss it later on um yeah
if you want to see more videos make sure to subscribe and please if you like this video leave like and subscribe
i've spoken subscribed three times but anyways thank you so much for watching and i will see you in the next video goodbye
i'm presented with an affordable two-in-one form factor device running on a modern and more optimized operating system is the joy 11 a worthy computing device for simple needs
it is rather weird to use them if used horizontally and while they are designed for vertical use holding it that way feels
well you know the word the two speakers mounted at the back of the tablet and they sounded rather tiny even at max volume
while not using intel's cherry true platform the intel atom z3735d processor is already sufficient for most simple applications paired with two gigabytes of ram
first of all it doesn't have a built-in battery to charge up the device nor does it offer additional storage to the tablet
however you might want to keep the touchpad locked from your accidental touches i use the droid11 mainly as my writing device during the review period
but what actually drives me away from phoning such a device would be the software experience as a rather frequent windows 10 user
I put the Fire HD 10 with Alexa built in to the test against the iPad pro, and some crazy drop tests.
I did awhile ago on an 8-Inch Tablet From Amazon, to put the new Fire HD 10 tablet to the test.
For the speed test, both tablets are on the same Wi-Fi network, using uncached versions of USAToday.com, and here we go, one, two, three.
I don't like that, and I'm sure some of you have a Siri that will give you jokes, but for whatever reason, during this tests, it did not.
For the drop test, I am not going to drop an almost 800-dollar iPad Pro, and smash it against the table, 'cause it will break.
On the Fire HD 10, some of you may recall, on the 8-inch tablet, I actually dented the floor, in a hotel room.
I probably should have mentioned, this is a new table, and we do replace these often, 'cause they break in all the time, but look at the dents.
So, again, not the most breathtaking speakers you'll ever hear, but, better than a lot of portable Bluetooth speakers, and, this is really easy to travel with.
In terms of size, and how this 10-inch tablet looks, this is more rectangular, and you have a more vertical experience.
Okay, so, you want to grab this, you can expand the video description box to find the link to this, but more importantly, how about getting one for free?
Go Connor. - [Alexa] Connor, this is amazing news, you are so lucky you have just won a Deal Guide giveaway, I'm so proud of you.
at least we've got a camera therefore if we do want to take the occasional snap so as you can see here
I am booted into Google Android and this is a ten point eight inch IPS display at nineteen twenty by twelve eighty resolution inside this tablet
eight three five zero processor running at one point nine two gigahertz four gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of storage
if we take a closer look around the edge of the device you can see across the top edge here in this corner
we've got some really cool paws we've got USB C which is used for charging we've also got micro USB we've got DisplayPort output
we've got a little connector here which connects to the optional keyboard that you can purchase and round on this side here
I'm not a fan of Windows but at least if you do want to boot into the Windows environment you have got that option
it's not a very expensive option and it really adds to the flexibility and use case scenarios of the chewy item plus
I'll leave a link to where you can pick up one of these for yourself down in the video description great build quality as well
it's a metal bag and the design is really very good in fact the build quality far exceeds my expectations for this price point
LD 16 drawing tablet while this isn't as well-known brand as some of the other brands out there for drawing tablets
I'm not sure which pens we'd have to actually ask artists on this is 76% Adobe RGB like I said this is a budget tablet
you can see a couple of the space right there we're gonna slide this off and you can see the 15.6 tablet there straight away
we'll look at these all individually so there's quite a lot here to unbox a few cables as well as instructions
you can see the logo there sitting upside down but if you are right-handed then obviously just flip it the other way around
even for this budget tablet that has been out for a while admin but yes all of that feels pretty great
now on the side you have an on/off volume button there's an LED light there as well HDMI and USB port
in the pen can go in either this way up or they have way up depending on however you need it and the money pen as they're calling
I never use but feel free to rock out in which ever way you personally would like to a little cleaning cloth branded utter also comes included
I don't know why next up cables mini HDMI to HDMI the mini HDMI and obviously plugging in to the tablet itself
that comes with different adapters so you can plug it into a UK adapter or a European or a US etc etc etc
but that might not matter to you if you're on a budget especially depending on what kind of illustration or creative endeavors that you do so okay
happy there there's a slight bit of bounce but some people like that softness of the pen nib yeah fully fully happy here
I'm using Photoshop as well by the way for today's line drawing test and yeah all the lines are coming off
that's been out for a while which is probably why you're gonna be able to get this very very small amount of money you know
I'm doing slow lines and I'm happy with what I'm getting diagonal lines there's no jitter that's more of a Microsoft problem though to be fair overall
I want it to do another pen test but this time do something more of a drawing go for something more of a comic book style
I was a big fan of the show when of the film the original film in the eighties when I was kid and now that Netflix has redone
YouTube and watching a lot of other videos and things like that and Netflix and Amazon and you know YouTube and stuff and yes so quite often
this is one of the characters from the Dark Crystal and it's just a light sketch but I think that's one of the things about this
I use it on all the time and I've got playlists about this so yes I found this to be really really good
really really simple and it works really well for line art so yeah really nice really happy and simple to use there
I could change that by using different nibs obviously but overall the experience was good moving on to the digital painting portion of the draw test
now the hotkeys and the jog wheel were absolutely brilliant for being able to change my brush size and so on and so forth in sketch a ball now
of course this is a budget tablet so if you want to make sure that your colors are spot on then
I would recommend using that secondary monitor to maybe mirror this screen so you can just double check that your screens
it's as it should be and you know you're not wholly bothered about how precise your colors are and you shouldn't be
The Stand actually worked really really well and like I say I could use that for other devices as well but you know the the jogwheel was incredibly useful
I'm I was really really thrilled to bits with that so could I get past things like it not having tilt on the pen you know yes
um if you've got the money then you are just going to pay more and have it all but for some people
still just to sketch my normal work my Commission work can take you know two weeks or more to do a finished piece but you know obviously here
but the upshot of this is that the drawing tablet the article d16 actually really helped me kind of idealize perfectly what
the pen movies 8,000 levels of pressure that we looked at in the pen test before we looked at in the other drawer test
yes very very happy with that and I think that's because this is actually a really easy tablet to pick up and just start using
I think this will be an absolutely great tablet for you because it's got hot keys it's got the stance guy thousand levels of pressure
you know on drawing tablets long before they were monitor tablets my first tablet as I've said many times before was just 2 inches by 2 inches
I always recommend a minimum of 2 hours a day and drawing different things things that you find hard to draw things that you find challenging to draw
yeah it has all the basic features that you're gonna need so let me know what you think in the comments about that

this is running full fledged Windows 8.1 touches smooth and responsive and the performance is also pretty smooth of the 16gb internal storage space
go to the fonts setting tap on adjust clear type text you will then get this screen just tap the next button and this is important here change it
once you change to this resolution the screen quality will improve and this is how it looks as you can see comparing with the previous one

HDMI to the tablet and the other end to my HDMI TV so I have this tablet connected to the TV using HDMI port
I'm going to attach this USB hub using the OTG cable to the tablet so that I get more USB ports so here goes the pendrive remember
that is working on the tablet as you can see and it also works on the TV which is basically a mirror image of the tablet screen
if you're using the mouse you can run exe files and all of these applications that you are seeing are on the external pendrive
I'm going to do is use the online keyboard type out my website address and view my website on the TV
now this is not a very powerful tablet but it is good enough for browsing for your office works for entertainment and for some limited gaming experience
moving on to the 16 by 9 high-def capacitive touchscreen automatically adjust brightness using an ambient light sensor and at the risk of burning down your battery life
there's also some backlight flare at the sides but nothing too distressing but what is particularly distressing is the erratic responsiveness of the touchscreen
in fact everything could just do with being a little bit smoother but of course this could all be fixed by a future
no internet fun time for that matter either but the good news is the screen is less susceptible to those horrible finger smears then the iPad
there's no ebook store either or any way to download titles but you can still use the juju as a reader we downloaded a few titles from
so you're left with streaming sites for your music and videos but this isn't entirely a bad thing there's loads of entertainment out there for example unsigned bands on
it's really just the bezel on the back you can see we have that very clean up kind of I pad metal
but if you slide this up which takes a little bit of force pushing like so you can get to the micro SD card slot underneath and doing it
so you don't actually have to use a card but of course if you want to it's nice to be able to expand storage
here's what makes the flyer special though it's not included in the box unfortunately in the US version so by Best
that's just you know your basic white box 7-inch but the vise sits in here and this is the little thing our pen came in
this is not honeycomb this is Android 2.3.3 Gingerbread but not the very latest release of Gingerbread that adds Google Talk video chat support
gigs of internal storage as we mentioned the microSD card slot the battery is sealed inside and this is a 1.5 gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU
we got a twenty forty seven for one of our better scores on quadrant which is getting close to some of the dual core
so we've got the blackberry playbook 7-inch the HTC Flyer 7-inch and the first seven inch Android mainstream tablet the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 inch

and if you don't want one of these you can just grab it take it off and you can put something else down here on the bar instead
applications one of them takes a screenshot of wherever you are and that is actually ours home screen screenshot and you can discard it
the pen does not work for regular navigation features just going to take a screenshot the other app and this is pretty neat
I'm not sure if this is just a customized version base you see I've ever known but yes it does say to Evernote which is great because ever no
you've got a little camera here if you wanted to snap a photo and put in your note an attachment you can attach a PDF something like that
a record button you can record voice and then embed that and send it to the calendar plus is to add a new note
brush a pencil and write to your heart's content and we'll go with the pencil right now and then with options you can choose which color so

I needed to clean my tablet after I unpacked it, and I had to fix some settings to get my pen to sync up to the screen.
you don’t need to charge the pen, but there are only 2,000 levels of pressure sensitivity instead of 8,000 from competitors.
look, but it still happened from time to time and made it impossible to see the fine details of what I was doing.
I removed the protector, wiped the tablet with water and a microfiber cloth and did the same to the screen side of the screen protector.
I wiped again with a dry microfiber cloth and let them sit for few hours in case there was more moisture.
To attach the stand, flip the tablet over so the label on the back faces the direction you can read it in.
Now, before you put the stand down, if you are left handed, rotate the stand 180 degrees so you are actually installing it upside-down.
the tablet can stand straight up, but if you end up doing that for some reason be careful not to tip it.
having this problem in other reviews, but if it happens to you like it did to me, there’s a trick to fix it.
The day after this when I turned the tablet and computer on, I had to reset displays to Duplicate and repeat that whole process again. It’s been fine since.
If you want to change your tablet’s screen settings, press the Menu button on the side of the tablet. Use the + and - buttons to navigate.
Overall, if you’re looking to get your first drawing tablet with a screen, the Gaomon PD1560 may be the way to go.
Drawing on it is the same experience as a more expensive model, with the exception of those tails from moving your hand too fast in Paint Tool SAI.

I'll be going over unboxing and long with the speed paint and pretty much share my thoughts and opinions on the tablet during that speed paint
this tablet is the huion 420 and I actually really liked the stylet but I'm gonna save my opinions for the speed paint
yes there we go whoo okay so once you open this you see a thank you note from huion and then the open ends their contact information
and then you know contact scan thing and it's a it's a cute card and then you have the tablet itself which
I'll get to in a second but you have the pin and I've noticed that this pin has a different end than what I normally used to
I am reviewing just so you can kind of get idea of what it's really capable of so as you can see during
so of course it's more convenient to take with you on trips or if you're just in the car with your smaller laptop being on a draw
it would have come with a little just a little battery to use just to kind of get me started but I mean that's a really minor complaint
I envy newer artists that are coming in to digital now because whenever I first started smaller cheaper tablets did not have this good equality so it is amazing
both how the the tablet is so cheap but it works like a professional bigger tablet and just how far drawing technology has come over the past few years
it is said of the one that I have now although I do love the tablet I have now but I really like this tablet
this tiny tablet can can sure pack a punch it does work well with these programs and I I am in love with it
Just to clarify since YouTube’s full of sponsored videos: as per the norm, a review sample was provided, but there are no contracts
in place, no money has exchanged hands, and I’m under no obligations to present this review with anything but total honesty.
So let’s dive in with some very basic information: this is the standard XP-Pen Artist 15.6, not to be confused with the similarly named pro model
This is very much a tablet for those looking to step up from the screenless alternatives without throwing too much cash around.
version, this standard offering doesn’t come with any stand, so if you’re looking to work on a desk at an angle, you’ll need to pick that up separately.
Out of the box, the colour calibration on the panel isn’t the greatest – aside from the excessive brightness, my sample leaned far too heavily into the blues.
However, the panel itself sits a good few millimetres under the matte cover, which does lead to a common issue with these types of tablets: the parallax effect.
It means that particularly towards the edges of the screen, your pen doesn’t line up with your cursor unless you tilt it directly up.
That’s a bit of a shame as drawing on the whole feels wonderful and responsive. There are 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity
Within the software, you can also change the sensitivity curve, which is super handy for someone like me who’s quite heavy-handed.
As is mostly standard, there are two customisable buttons on the pen that, again, can be easily configured with the provided software.
Strangely, there is no eraser on the end of the pen, so if that’s built into your muscle memory, you may need to take some time to adjust.
By default, one of the buttons on the pen is set to toggle between brush and eraser, which has always been my preference over physically flipping the pen over.
It also supports hold, so much like holding spacebar to move the canvas around in photoshop, the same can be replicated by holding the button on the tablet.
That’s great if you’re someone who likes to work fullscreen and doesn’t like having to faff around coming out in that mode just to access something else.
You have heaps of customisation, robust build quality and very responsive drawing capabilities, all at a good size that’s a nice medium between portability and usability.
I've hooked up a gamepad and you can see the rating game has felt eight running really nice and smoothly really slick when you add the three gamepad
it works really well and it's got bluetooth on it so of course you can add a keyboard if you want to do some work or you could
I love having gadgets that light up to do things to allow you to play games in different ways so just recently
that are huge and take up a lot of space and the drawing surface may seem a bit too tiny for some people
but when you consider that you're going to be drawing and you're gonna be looking at the TV screen for the majority of the time
it's not bad at all so let's look at the game menus and see how this thing works no we got
this is so that the program can redraw your image from the beginning for you and that's one of my major complaints about this system
it is kind of a really amazing feature but only being able to draw so much before you have to stop really is a nuisance
they'll be able to show what they drew to family and friends and they won't even think about the time left that they have to draw
if you don't give help on technique and how to use the stylus correctly on the stylus it can be a bit difficult to get used to ok
then it's going to be tougher because you won't use the side button you'll use the tip like a brush or a pen
I can really see it being very useful and since people can place their images onto an SD card and upload them from their computers
kids might get confused on how to do specific things but they will have fun just peddle farting around with it
8.0 is on top of nougat and for whatever reason many of nougats signature features are missing for example split view
Android devices but having the option to enable these features in the settings out-of-the-box is pretty neat one feature that is found in the developer options of
there's also a neat feature to auto start apps under app settings you can add applications to auto start when the device is booted up
so you can tweak some of these settings to improve the performance so the me pad 3 runs very well out of the box
C a high-end Snapdragon processor but the media tech chip seems to perform well and there's a generous amount of RAM
I just can't really justify buying an 8 inch tablet on the phone in my pocket is only a couple inches smaller
gearbest is selling it for right around three hundred dollars and it does come in English so definitely be sure to check it out
I will tell you that Acer makes it the Iconia one in an 8-inch model great tablet but I like the bigger tablets
you know your usual complement of Google applications and of course there is a few other applications pre-loaded on the tablet
this will be your power on button your volume up and down and it also comes with a micro SD card slot 32 gigabytes of flash storage
what's inside so this is the tablet itself it is huge and the other things that I included in the box would be the driver CD
we have the pen the pen holder and some extra lips so the extra nibs are hidden in the pen holder
that is non removable so if the battery runs low you will have to charge it with the USB cable that is provided
I got the tablet and I find that I haven't seen the need to charge it again a few weeks after this is still quite the battery
this light is for the pen so if the pen is on the surface the green light will light up then there are also lights for the battery
and this will light up so you can charge your tablet and below there on the left corner we have 12 buttons
when you install the driver but you can customize them as well so these buttons on the left side are very useful by the way to use tablet
actually so this is the part where you can plug into your computer it actually has 8 gigabytes of storage and
I would put my driver files onto these thumb drive so if I want to bring this tablet to my office
Mac first let me plug in the USB receiver and turn on the tablet alright so I've already installed the drivers
I find that the default setting works best for me so I don't have to change that you can also customize buttons on the tablet these twelve buttons
performance is very smooth and very predictable the pressure sensitivity works very well and the drivers are work very well to rest well
there is going to be the driver conflict so you can either use free on or the surface pen but you cannot use both at the same time
I've drawn more lines than earlier on but when you zoom in and take a look these lines are perfectly smooth so
I'm not sure with that if that is actually a problem with Photoshop are with the driver anyway to solve the problem with the jittering lines you
let me zoom in and let you see how smooth the lines are so this is much much smoother compared to that default setting without lazy
Nezumi I highly recommend this plug-in but this is going to cost you some extra money if you are not using Photoshop
I have actually installed a lot of drawing software on this Windows machine for example mischeif SketchBook Pro art rich media Bank
and this is the Motorola Xoom Android tablet this is the first honeycomb Android 3.0 tablet on the market and as a 10.1 inch capacitive
there's a fairly narrow bezel here which is great when you're bringing up the on-screen keyboard that must show you later
you don't have a whole lot of beds between you and the keyboard you've got the front-facing 2-megapixel video chat camera up
there are slots for SIM card and microSD card because it's a tray to hold the SIM card for LTE when the LTE upgrade is available
they can take up to six business days for them to put the LTE radio and this is the micro SD card slot
I've actually been able to two-hand multi-touch type and that much more calm and I haven't needed a keyboard as much as I thought
alright well now we're gonna dig into the software but first a quick rundown on the specs if you haven't learned about that zoom yet
Tegra 2 Nvidia processor running at one gigahertz as a gig of ram 32 gigs of internal flash storage that micro SD card slot
and you've still got the scrolling desktops are used to an Android as you can see but they look a little bit different kind of Traum like that
you've got the blue outlines around each one is you're moving around to see the borders and the widgets have changed a bit as well
if you want to get to your apps drawer with all your apps tap them up here on the apps icon and then are there
this is a high quality 800 by 480 inch resolution mpeg-4 file clearly no problem for the NVIDIA Tegra 2 dual core processor with GPU acceleration next
dobe says it's going to take them a couple more weeks and then you'll be able to play full flash on this
this probably isn't going to be a device for you but if you like green you know an LCD pretty image
but because it's 1280 pixels across there's no need to zoom right now so don't happen and we've got another tab running over here no problem
we're gonna take a link some applications that have been optimized with the tablet already with CNN's Reader just came out today
thanks a minute and then it was very graphical looking application and you can scroll through and check out items that are here
take a look at a very popular news reader pulse which has been optimized for tablet as well another highly graphical interface over here
but guess what you can plug this into your HDMI display or HD TV and watch your multimedia content in fact everything replicated on the screen on HDMI
there isn't one in the box with this and as you can see we'll just wake that back up again there
there's five on audio and HD video a trip to the TV all scream up strange little video there man every just want to play something from gallery
that's an image of my 480 and pink for moving that we've got loaded on the zoom laying down for HDMI 750 HTV so pretty new
and this is the Motorola Xoom Android 3.0 honeycomb tablet available now from Verizon Best Buy Costco and other sources visit our website to read the full review
little unboxing a quick setup review and also make sure to stay to the end for a surprise animation that i made using the tablet
galman is currently hosting a coupon promotion up until december 31st so this is actually the best time to buy it and yeah
whoa okay i'm gonna i'm just gonna put this away for now but sure i'll have lots of time to play with it later
stylus a stand with an adjustable viewing angle and 8 192 levels of pressure sensitivity as well as 88 color gamut
it's a decent tablet good build and tons of customizable express keys which i find very useful for animating in a complex animation program like toon boom harmony
i'm like there's no way on earth i'm going to be spending that because tablets are more of a luxury these days than a necessity for me
i'm hoping that this is going to be something that i can say is a good saving on hundreds of pounds
i would otherwise have spent for something that is going to be obviously lower in specifications but good value and just feels good in the hand
i just wanted to be able to carry out the simple tasks that i needed to do without too much fuss and without too much frustration full disclosure
i've got to say full color ac power adapter and the box came in this pretty pink slip casing there which kept it safe
but it was kept safe all the same and the screen itself is a 10-incher 1280 by 100 ips hd display and
oddly satisfying a peel off just for you and the the stand there is my own by the way it's easy to turn on there
it's got that feeling of a certain sheen and it costs a lot more but to be quite honest with you
the k10 in my hands because it's got less slip to it especially at the back and i feel comfortable handling it
it's not too plasticky and cheap feeling there's an eight megapixel camera on the back and there's a two megapixel camera on the front enabling video calling now
it does the job the 2 megapixel uh one on the front uh is crap there are stereo speakers and with 32 gigabytes of storage
the k10 tablet supports expandable memory by microsd card up to 128 gigabytes which means there's huge room for everything after all with the built-in google assistant
for the money the dragon touch and its features has two gigabytes of ram 16 gigabytes flash memory that can be expanded by the microsd slot the whole purpose
there have been no issues with wi-fi connectivity apps that are installed or performance the fact that it comes with a pre-installed screen protector is a sweet bonus
the only minor con i can think of is the micro sd slot is hard to find but since it's behind the cover it's a lot more secure
they said they'd replace the tablet and goes through various updates and eventually he did receive an email from dragon touch customer support
but he's ended up being happy with the service that's good to know things were resolved in the end and xenoline five stars
sound the tablet his android system that supported all the apps from google play had the same features with others expensive products
very good all-round tablet if you don't mind less than full hd so far i'm impressed more product for the money than any other tablet i've purchased
the only issue i've had is a couple of times the audio jack didn't shut off the tablet speakers but nothing a few unplugged
my impression has been that even if i bought it with my own dollars i would have been satisfied with what it can do for the money
you know four or five times the price but once you've got used to that which only takes a couple of hours
those few microseconds back and as obviously less resolution and stuff so it just feels like going back to an old phone or an old tablet
there's thousands of reviews and as i say most of them are positive and you can look at the critical ones and to make up your own mind
thank you for hanging out with me and thank you very much for dragon touch for sending this for review and for sponsoring this video
oh and if you're new here please remember to subscribe before you leave and tickle the little notification bell because it gets a little bit lonely down there cheerio
i'm more on like do moving pictures like pmvs but sometimes i do animate a little bit here and there so open your main drawing program
some people just do line art and some people just do rough sketches and it's all completely fine and for me
it also has this protector that you have to peel before using and under it of course had these manuals for drivers and a thank you note for buying
i'll probably just bring this with me and connect it to my phone while i'm traveling but not one of these days
i haven't found any downsides some may find it too small some may have issues with the size but honestly it's okay for me
it's it's still hard but i'm definitely using this for my future videos for now i'll keep playing around with it
I'm going to show you my Wacom tablet and give you my honest review and rundown of the Wacom one splash and at the very end of the video
what's going to be uploaded on this channel this week here at Satori ethics so at the Wacom splash one tablet for quite a while two years in fact
if you're a professional digital artist or illustrator you might want to look into more of the advanced tablets but for me the
so of course you have the actual tablet itself which is very lightweight and thin the texture of the durum pad is remarkably smooth
there's also the USB cable for you to hook up to your laptop of your computer and there is a CD that comes with it
Wacom pen here and if you press this whilst ruining illustrator you can click and drag to navigate around the screen which is a great addition
be very very ideal for someone who's just getting involved in graphic design but also for professional local designers and also people who enjoy hand lettering like myself like
I have a few scuffs on my tablet and it still works perfectly fine at a low price of around 60 or 70 dollars
it's not that expensive and it will supply lots of fun and lots of opportunity in your graphic design workflow so let me know what you think about the
I guess so that I don't rub accidentally and make marks that I don't want cool dude all right all right you got a glove
USB connectors I got some USB adapters different types of USB cable alright I think that's it plugs right in there SiC
and you're kind of seeing me struggle here figuring out how do that there are so many ways of doing different things in
the thing this is called the lasso tool or the quick selection tool or something but this is like the most tedious tool for me in Photoshop
I graduated from a Wacom tablet which I actually haven't used in years so I guess I can't really say I graduated
I just bought a different pad and it's bigger this one's bigger than my old one by like double and I really like it
I really just was playing around with brushes and stuff oh man I kind of addicted to brushes so I get it now
I tried some this website called true grit they have a bunch of cool comic II sort of brushes and stamps and things
of course so what do we got here with the actual tablet itself taking off the protective screen and just to have a brief look at the unit
there's a pin connector here and that pin connector mates to this pin connector at the bottom and it will snap in place so let me try that out
s all you're gonna get and as far as the disk storage system so there's 32 gigabytes that it comes with and we've got 17 gigabytes free
it did do a Windows Update by updating all the components last night to take quite a bit of time to do that
Earth does not seem to work too well with pinch zoom and things like that as you can see the graphics
I mean it's it's fairly quick it's rendering not too bad zooming in to street-level here loading up through the wireless system and the wireless system is a 2.4
it's it's loading pretty well probably going into Street View and see how it's going to respond to that okay not bad
but if you're kind of like in an angle which you will be typing sometimes because of the way it's you know your fingers move about
this is only a $56 tablet so it's not a great you know it's not gonna have great imaging capabilities but is there
I got Microsoft edge running and I found that edge works the best on this one gigabyte platform rather than Google Chrome
Google Chrome seems to be a little bit more laggy and you can see here it Scrolls really fast there's no problem with the scrolling and
a fast tablet would be and I got it in HD mode so it's in 720p and again the resolution of this tablet is 1280 by 800
but when do you start loading up a whole lot of tabs on here or if you dare to try to run another aggressive application
Windows tablet so if you're looking for Windows specific applications and you need to run a Windows specific application or or hardware for example
I have another review of a Heon product this time I'll be reviewing the huion canvas GT 156 HD feet 2 tablet
I've never owned or tried one before so I gave myself a few days before using this tablet and writing a proper review on it anyway
after that you see me manual on how to use the stand and here's what everything looks like inside the box
now here's the cute little carrying case with the stylus and a crap ton of pen names with a little metal boy that helps extract the pen nibs
I thought this was real cute and it made me feel organized for the first time in my life also comes with an anti smudge glove thing
I'm not a huge fan of these because it makes everything too slippery and kind of hurts my hand after a while but it makes you look edgy
Heon website at checkout pretty sure and an installation CD which is really small and cute and reminds me of a GameCube game discs so BRB
Monitor reveal Wow so new and clean so on the side of the monitor you have six keys and two of which are kind of like analog sticks
I don't quite know how to describe them and I guess you can use that to navigate and in the middle here
that's like detects your finger rather than the stylus and you can use it to zoom and scroll and all that kind of stuff
it just feels more natural like you would imagine that traditional art feels like more natural like drawing on an easel it worked really well with
they spend maybe like an hour on the drawing before it starts really hurting like the nape of my neck / like my back cuz
so this actually felt really nice and I'll probably start using this more often than my graphic tablet another thing I noticed on this tablet
I'm not sure if this is like a normal thing it's not off by too much but because it doesn't have the tilt recognition
I can understand the price being lower for that aspect besides the fact that it has a few errors it has a really good color quality
leave a comment with any questions you have pertaining to this tablet and I can answer them for you if you're interested
