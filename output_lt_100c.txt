today we have a quick review here of the dragon touch 10.1 inch android tablet
care sort of backlight on there
we have a few more specs to talk about
it's running android 10
like i said has three gigs of ram
uh which is nice
the box doesn't include a lot
but you get a usb-c charger and a wall plug you get a two-year warranty which is cool
there's not a whole lot of you know customizing or options
it's a very good quality tablet basic android build
so that's kind of neat it does auto rotate
because of that octa-core processor it is really fast it does
i'm just going to click on this video here
as an example
we'll go back here
see how fast that is
but this model doesn't have any sim cards slots built in so for the us
it's just a
i just gotta click on the right spot there there we go go back
hit the home button and go launch another app like chrome inside chrome
we'll go load a web page
let's go to this little car page right here
you can kind of see how fast the internet loads on this
and then we'll scroll and use the um sort of this is a high demand website for sure
we'll be able to kind of see that right
there we go now
that's fully loaded
you can kind of see that little bit of delay if we go to view the interior and click on that link
now we've got an interior spot
click on one of these buttons
see if we have anything that pops open there get a little book
that was the backup camera
it said there we go and then we'll go to a different program
let's just click on google maps
see how this loads go to google maps
do a little pinch to zoom
it's like i said it's very solid
the other thing to talk about would be the camera
the um the back camera is i would say decent quality
we'll take a little picture here
so i'll zoom in and just uh hit go and you can kind of see those results
it's a decent quality camera you know it's definitely nothing to write home about
um it does work fast
i just have to hit the right buttons there
we go and we can take a picture this way too
and so i think it'll if it fits in your budget and kind of does um media and entertainment
i have on youtube and rate comment and subscribe thanks
how's it going guys
my name is fi and welcome back to the channel
i just want to say thank you to everyone
m106k pro gaomon has been a renowned developer in the chinese local market since 2011.
so we are going to start with unboxing so we have the tablet itself
which is you can claim one year warranty
you can look on the detailed description on the screen
m106k pro can be used on windows mac and android one of the reason
why i like this tablet is because it has this something at the bottom that make the table
stay and it won't be easily move
another thing
is we have a like
we have 12 shortcut buttons here
so you won't be needing a keyboard anymore when you're drawing or animating
let's look at the pen so the pen is very light
download the windows driver
and if you are in mac download the mac driver once you download your driver you open it here
you can see a bunch of settings you can just set your hand pressure here
you also can set the buttons
the tablet shortcut buttons here
so i'm going to start drawing now and let's see if we find any issue you can say
the pen pressure is pretty good
the pen is very good
the pen pressure is good
it doesn't have a problem for me to to draw and everything is smooth
the hotkeys also helps me a lot
it is the drawing that i made with a m106k pro by gomon
i don't really have anything much to say because i think this is a good tablet
i was just like focused on my drawing and coloring and stuff
nothing really bothered me so like i think
this tablet is really good
so it's very nice so yeah you can buy this on the links i will put the links in the description
you go check it out so yeah
check the links below as for my next animation
i'm working on a rick
so yeah so that's it guys
thank you for watching my review
and i'll see you in the next one see ya you
hey MJ here for tech reporter TV today with a review of the Samsung Galaxy Tab
a 7.0 the first 7-inch tablets from Samsung's Galaxy Tab A series that was introduced last year
it's one of the cheapest tablets out there with a starting price of one hundred sixty nine year
olds but you can get it for 119 years
actually right now and
we're starting with the design and build quality and the design is very typical from Samsung
obviously at this price point everything is plastic but I was quite quite surprised
it feels quite solid
but it's changed now which is very nice and the rest is alright as well
it's quite bright
it will transform into a mirror like most tablets but for the price to the display
here is quite nice inside
and what's a bit set
US dollars I kind of expect 16 gigabytes
but that's not what we are getting here
there's a micro SD card slot
so if you want to
you can store music movies and so on on my grade
D card
they're two cameras with a resolution of 5 and 2 megapixels
where we don't have it
that's more for higher
end devices of all the performance is pretty good
most apps
want smoothly in here
you can browse the web smoothly surf
YouTube and play a couple of games
it went quite smoothly
this is not a gaming tablet not because of the performance
it's alright for most games but the storage is with a gigabyte just very low
so you can't install that many games in Geekbench 3 in the single core test
I got around 350 points and in the mighty quadtest
Android 6.0 marshmallow has been out for why now but Samsung still ships
this with n-word 5.1.1
I'm not sure with cheap tablets
we often a stack with the
N word and that's pre-installed on it by when you get it
it's not that bad though because lollipop is still a good and stable operating system
the same goes for touch with
it's not as overloaded as it used to be
he just won two years ago
it's actually quite nice now overall
Samsung did not pre install a lot of apps on the Galaxy
Tab 7.0
well it's not that much room
that's missing which is great
I don't like it but other features that we like that
I like in touch with like the multi window feature and that still included
you can open website beside and that runs pretty good on here in my bed we test the Galaxy Tab 7.0
that's a pretty pretty good battery life
I always do the same battery
test a1 a 720p video over and over again and the brightness will set to 50%
they're only some from Gmail but it's really it so 9.5
hours just over nine point five hours
it's a very good result overall
you get a good build quality a nice display
the performance is not the best
but that's alright
it's kind of said that we want to get eight gigabytes
then it's a very nice tablet all right
this is a quick review from these ten some Galaxy Tab 7.0
and nj4 tech reporter
TV thanks for watching
hello everybody this is my MSM
fire seven tablet for view here is the SD port
it's the heart just so you can have more data
there's a power button over here
this is the charging point
then we have the jack for the headphones
so you don't really need wires and then there's like volume very nice usually
I'm a solo every time it comes with that free time which I really believe is very useful for kids
because it's very simple you can
you just went back for and there's nothing to it you're gonna have control of what
obviously you want them to have and also if you have more than one tab
we're like three pallets
it comes with this camera in the back and this one upfront
and they're both okay
they're not really good but this efficiently gets the job done
if you're gonna get this tablet for a present
it's going to be very frustrating if you keep up with it and there's just nothing in it
I make that mistake the first time
here's the charger
you just plug it in here
very simple really
I love this salad and I'm really happy with it
it really helps entertain my kids
they also when they're driving around in the car
you're like two big pictures of things
it's a very good way for them
that's all the apps if you're clear
I was blind
you're now to be able to see anything see you
there's no it helps with you
Wi-Fi Boucher good structure
that helps you fall asleep
thanks really good
I like this word right
yes you can see you with your thumb
oh and then you can have different profiles
were nice enough to send me a review
copy of a brand new gaomon pd
1560 drawing tablet rolls right off the tongue doesn't it
i also gotta say that
the monitor itself is pretty responsive
we're ready to get started
but the pen they shipped it with just wouldn't respond to our inputs on the tablet itself
so it was unusable
but this is where i need to give props to gaomon
i was ready to give up this whole ordeal which is also why this review took so long
they sent us this whole guide on how to fix it and that did end up working in our case so well
it was a bit of a headache getting it to work
i now got the sweet
15.6 inch tablet with 18 92 and 81 92 pen pressure and hd ips
full screen
it's nothing you haven't seen before
it comes with all the cables attached
the plastic makes it come off as a bit cheap completely
unlike the tablet itself which is a hefty piece of hardware especially with the holster behind it
i think for that you can also use the protective foil
plus they sent us a pair of those drawing gloves to make it a bit easier on their hands
but i can't find them
they were alright
it actually isn't difficult at all to use once you did set it up properly
i'd say look into one of these as i'm happy to own mine make of that what you will
hey there
ATS de volta Villa for hot hardware and this is Dells venue 838 48 inch
Android tablet this is Dells refreshed
venue cradle duck here
the tablet itself retails starting at a very competitive price of currently just 179 99
v ARS g 1600 series graphics core
also onboard is one gigabyte of ddr3
it may not be super premium in terms of build quality but the general design
aesthetic definitely doesn't feel cheap either
it's a well-built tablet
on the top edge is where you'll find the headset jack
and power button on the right
edge is where all the action is and here
port and a concealed micro SD card and micro SIM card slot area on the front face
the tablet on the cradle it charges the device wirelessly
the technology employed
here is inductive charging and it's only available with the Dell Venue 8 3840 line of tablets
configuration devoid of bloatware thankfully
del does install pocket cloud and Dropbox apps for external cloud storage and collaboration
but that's really about it
that's a little bit roomier
it's not quite as tight
quite well actually
what we've noted here however
is that the physics scores show
Dells new Intel dual core powered tablet trailing a bit which is specifically a CPU bound test
s4 in the rear view
make sure you stop by hot
comm with the Dell Venue 8 38 48 inch Android Intel powered tablet
thanks for stopping by
hello everyone and welcome back to the friendly horse
uk tech review channel
and i'm trying a new angle and i just want to say a very big thank you to all the viewers
you're all winners on this channel
let's run through the nitty gritty
and first of all
here's the box and as you can see it's a
it's a rather nice box
there wasn't much in the box you know
the tablet was here in this little plastic thing reasonable packaging some foam around it
obviously there was a whatever they call it
that's it now
this tablet here
uh here it is here it is uh as i said a 10.1 inch and first of all
let's talk about the build quality now
the first thing that struck me it's quite heavy
i don't know if you can see that
but we've got power on and off volume up and down
that's the charging port and unfortunately it's only the old micro usb
it's not the usb type-c you've got a 3.5 millimeter headphone uh socket
there and then you've got two sockets here now
this isn't a 4g lte tablet
it's heavy metal back
it feels you know good quality
i'm gonna give it eight out of ten now screen
i was impressed by the brightness
i have to tell you you know you know it it
it really does go nice and bright
you know if you go lower you're gonna see pixels but uh not a bad display for the price
well we'll give it a 5.
it's it's acceptable
um but you know it's what it is now ram
this was another thing that appealed to me this device comes with three gigabytes of ram
so that's good for a budget tablet
that's good i'm gonna give that seven
maybe an eight out of ten again now
the weak point of this tablet is the processor
it's not particularly snappy
and i think the three gigs of ram a little bit wasted on it but it all works
it's fine
i haven't had anything that didn't work but there is a little bit of lag there
you know things aren't quite as rapid as they could be so
i think the processor
that is the weak link in this device
and i'm only gonna score it four out of ten
i'm afraid uh the wi-fi very good connects fast stable good speed all over the place
i don't know if it's just this app
i suppose
but there's very few settings you know
picture size is 13 megapixel on the rear
it's the same
i'll give the camera a six out of ten battery
uh it's got a six thousand
milliamp battery is fast
i'm not getting more much more than about five hours of screen on time
six at tops
i'd say five to six hours of screen on time from the six thousand milliamp battery
i think that's pretty average
it's okay it's not good
it's not bad so you know you know it's powering a good screen a good good display
you know it's full android 9.
not one of those go edition things
it's the full android 9 but that's it
and it's not offering me any wireless updates of any sort so i've got a suspicion
it's going to be stuck on android 9 with a july 19 security patch
know certain websites vanco matrix pad z10 android tablet
um depends where you live on the prices but you know british pounds in the uk
probably just a little over 100 pounds because let's face it tablets
it does a job
it's got a nice bright screen
you know three gigs of ram fairly reasonable cameras
nicely built um you know
but you know if you're looking for something competitively priced
that does the job then
yeah i think i can get recommend it
you know that's my view on it all the best and i'll catch you next time
bye for now
it's this Gaoman s620 tablet right here
it's great for drawing
that's what my main research was when
I was selecting this but I came across a lot of reviews that from this game called OSU players
alright so you get a warranty card
then you get the cable
the pen and this pen is battery less
I mean nowadays all the newer stuff
it's without a battery
it's nice and light very comfortable and then you have
I mean my hands are average size
I think you'll be fine too all right
and then here's the actual tablet
um it's got four keys that you can program to like quick keys or whatever
it came down to two tablets
so what makes this a good tablet
first thing is the drawing size its 6.5 inches by 4 inches
when you're drawing it can sense how hard you're pressing to make it wider or thinner the line
you're drawing and right now from my research
the most high-end ones have 8192 levels
and that's what this thing has
this is on par with like 70 to $100 tablets in that regard
it's on par with tablets that cost around seventy to a hundred bucks
so that's another really good thing about this tablet for the price
I'm just gonna do some simple designs just to show you the lines and stuff
I have the artistic talent of a tree stump
so don't expect anything fancy but you will get to see how this works
I clicked something there
you could just lightly scribble something and then you know anyway
I think this shows enough of how it works
you can get the picture all right so as you can see it works pretty well pretty accurately
I'll have a link down in the description below
you can check it out
thank you for watching if you like commented subscribed
I appreciate it helps me out have a great day
see you next time
hi Rosie good morning and welcome back to
the channel is the sketch monkey here and in today's video
I'm excited about this because it's not one of these expensive brands
that has a ton of marketing behind it and I want to emphasize that point
can he get a redesign done without any hiccups or problems
and that's we're gonna figure out it right now
it might be mistaken for a tablet with a battery inside
but this isn't a tablet
it's simply a vein monitor that you can sketch on and it needs
I'm gonna show you in a bit
the tablet itself feels pretty solid and well put together with a matte surface all around
it's a simpler stand but same thing here
I prefer to sketch with anyway
you also have a scroll wheel for zooming in or out
is this little character inside the scroll wheel which
I kind of like because it makes me feel like XP pan and know their target audience
it's something I haven't seen any other brand do and it's just a fun little detail next
we have the case in which we'll find the pen
the pen itself is a little bit shorter than a
it's too customizable buttons on the pen here as well just like we're used to and personally
I only use the front button and I use that as a right mouse
click to bring up my brushes in
Photoshop you also get a sketching glove and a cool calendar with this version of the artist
15.6 throw the cables are pretty much straightforward young
you'll need to connect the tablet to your computer via USB and if the USB port is powerful enough
I'm using an iMac and I don't need the wall plug to run the tablet however
not exactly sure what these things are but
I assume they are part of the Holiday Edition
it's pretty interesting now
I don't want you to miss out on that because it's so satisfying to see so here
you go enjoy now since this is a review
we have an active area of 344 by 193 millimeters
the pressure sensitivity is 8,192 levels
the tilt for the pad is 60 degrees
the pen is battery free in the shortcut keys
we have eight of them of course with the roller wheel
the display color gamut is 88% NTS C 120% s RGB resolution is 50 80 LPI
let's get sketching and see what this XP pan or is 15.6 pro can do
I'm starting out in Photoshop
as usual here and just want to put down some lines to check the pressure sensitivity and accuracy
the surface feels a little softer than what
I'm used to as if the pen has more bounce in it
if that makes sense not a bad thing
it's just a little bit different
and you're good to go then download the drivers and do some calibration if you want to
I didn't really have to do any calibration or adjust
the contrast the standard settings works
well it's pretty much the same as what
I have the keyboard next to the tablet
and that's where
I use to control everything in Photoshop such as zoom pan rotate
and more however
I can see this set up being useful if you get used to it
this could create a nice workflow for summer but since
I'm stuck in my old ways
I'm going to stick with the keyboard
first impressions are good
that the only difference is the layout of the customizable buttons as long as the pressure
sensitivity is on point
the pen feels good in my hand
the contracts is has good blacks and whites and the responsiveness is sharp
I'm happy the rest is just stuff I never use or care about
I wanted to show you the distance from the actual tip of the pen and the stroke on the canvas
this can take a little while to get used to since the thickness of the screen
it creates this gap between the two points
it only really affects you
it's one of the most beautiful
I forgot that I was actually switching
tablets this is a good thing because it means the
XP pen didn't interfere with my workflow and is the tool
I need to get the job
done a good tool shouldn't bring too much attention to itself instead
it should allow me to focus on the design work and help me get the result
I want without making a lot of noise about it if that makes sense
so that's the review of the XP pen artist 15.6
pro what can
I say it did everything that I was expecting it to do
the bottom line here is if you're looking for a tablet a displace
I think it's $399
this tablet is a really good value
I hope this video is useful to you and I hope you enjoyed this short redesign as well
I'm the sketch monkey
thanks again for checking out this video
it really means a lot to me if you enjoyed it
hit that like button
I upload it stuff like this I hope to see you in the next one
I'm the sketch
monkey take care
i love it because it looks very clean
you can download the drivers
this is a welcoming card
pretty handy as well right
the pan has a very nice grip right then
this is the latest one download extract the file and install
you don't have to use the default one right so i'm testing it on board now as you can see
it's very smooth on gen bot
i can do my writing
if you're teaching mathematics this is also very simple to use very cool right and i can draw
i can scribble
i can do whatever i want on this jam board
let's try it out
and above it currently does not support ios but uh the tablet supports
mac os meaning
you can use it in your macbook but not on iphone at the moment
okay so you have to use it on your android phone
i don't have ones i couldn't test it for you
um so that's uh zoom
now let's move on to um photoshop right
just look at the photoshop so it also supports in photoshop
you can scribble you can color or you can change it
you can also use the pen as a cursor or as a mouse and you can you know maneuver on screen
so that's photoshop
you can see it's very smooth
you can use it to color you can use it to draw
you can use it to scribble so far
i am i kind of like the the smoothing of it
so there you have it gaomon x620 which is really affordable uh in malaysia
i think it cost you less than 200 ringgit
you can check out
the various links online on the e-commerce website like shopping malaysia
and all that because i think it cost you less than 180.
don't forget to subscribe to my channel for more reviews and also don't forget to like this video
thank you very much
see you in the next video you
hey what's up guys this is
inches it is a 16 to 9 ratio so just standard widescreen
which means it's going to be kind of along the lines of your LG televisions that aren't OLED
it's got a great great viewing angle 178 degrees
you can look at it
basically from anywhere with basically no distortion
so that's really really good now
IPS displays do have slightly less vibrance
they're slightly less color rich but I hadn't really noticed too much of an issue
it's really not a big deal so it's really really nice
in fact it can reproduce a 16.7 million colors so
but it's a graphics tablet not a TV monitor or computer monitor
so when you're when you're only a few inches away with your face in some cases
I mean maybe 10 inches away
it's not a problem
I guess some people might want it brighter
but this thing is not those things so
I think that's not a problem at all
it's up to you to decide if it is for you but for me
I don't have any issue with with the quality of the screen
the the glass is perfectly smooth
perfectly glossy shiny glass so it does look nice but it could be an issue for reflections
it does come with a screen protector on it in the package now
it's not the kind of screen protector
where the entire thing is sticky
there's almost no reflection so that's great and I don't mind the paper feel
I know some people prefer it
I actually like the the smooth glass field
but that's totally up to you
so at least you have the options you will see some kinda like coloration issues from the screen
protector in the hub
you'll lay like plastic on top of a screen that happens but once you turn it on
but that's about it
it's really not a big deal
another good thing about this display is that it has a 5 millisecond response time
I haven't noticed any issues at all with that as far as inputs go we have HDMI DVI and VGA
now one issue with that
is that the
the inputs are toward the bottom of the display
GT 190 that I've used
I haven't had that be a problem in fact
I don't have any issue now
there is a hinge for the display
stand which if you fold it all the way flat
I have no problem I keep it at about 45 degrees
I don't have an issue with those
some people have got could but for me
it's not an issue at all so we did mention the display stand and how that could affect the cords
it hasn't for me because it's a really really really great displaced and
you just pull on it and adjust it and let go and you're done
I like it
I don't see I haven't seen at least in pictures
I haven't used any other display tablets
that aren't who yawn but they they don't look great from other companies
so it's not going to fly it around on your table now
it does connect only in the middle of the unit
but you're really going to have to push to notice it when
I suppose it depends on how you have it
I wouldn't worry about it
I think that's just fine now
the last thing to mention about the unit itself is that it does not have any
Express keys which for me is not an issue
I don't use them
this doesn't have it
it has a few buttons for monitor settings
but that's it so that's a deal-breaker for you then there you go but for me
I have no use for hot or for Express keys so it's fine now
we probably should talk about the pen
the pen is kind of an important part of a pen display tablet
so you actually get two pens in this package
it's pretty pretty awesome
having extra pens nice even though they last 800 continuous hours on a charge
you can do that four hundred times before it runs out of juice supposedly
I haven't been able to test that yet
but supposedly the lasts that long it takes about an hour to charge and it does give you
they do give you the cable to charge it in the package
it's just a little
USB charging cable so it's pretty convenient the Pens do have 2048 levels of sensitivity
which is very nice
it's pretty much standard for these kind of tablets
now the one thing
I have an issue with for these pens
it will sometimes give you a little go to this step
maybe that's how
I'm using it
I don't know I haven't heard anybody else complain about that but sometimes it happens
I've noticed it might just be my the way I do my strokes
I don't know but that's something worth mentioning the Pens
do have two buttons on them which are assignable
so that's useful you also get eight needs eight nib replacements if you happen to wear them down
also the last thing to mention
is that within this package
I guess you could make the argument
you're going to want to use the artist gloves now
your hand will move smoothly across the screen protector
slide your hand across so having the artist
Club in there is very nice
I've had the glove from the GT 190 for a year now and it hasn't really worn at all
so that's it
that's all of the official stuff so the last thing to talk about is just that it looks very nice
it's got a nice silver bezel going all the way around and it's got nice build quality
I mean I guess it could be nicer
it's not quite the same level as my television
which is a lot more money but you know it's for what it is it's very very solid
I haven't had any issues with it at all and the build quality is nice
the buttons all press well so
I'm very very happy with it
I couldn't be more satisfied
and here's the thing at this price point there's really not a competitor that appears to be better
I haven't used it so I can make a direct comparison but it more than double the price
I can't see how this isn't going to be a competitor
practically speaking is that when technically better
I don't know but at more than doubles of price
this one is definitely going to be worth worth giving a shot
I think I'm very happy with it
I'm thoroughly satisfied with it
I'm not getting a commission for saying any of this by the way I'm just letting you guys know
I'm very happy with the product
so if you're not into this you might be into that not my thinks
I like the displays but you might want to check it out

I'm closing in the cat shining on my hands just shining shining on my hands
I'm shining my mother shining on my shoes next
please shine shining on my hands
here's the name speech shining on my hands
man no me
Oh I breathe
I can hear my friend you and me I he's just a little I can you
hi everyone
I'm bringing a new video today about a brand
I'll show you
what would you get
if you had one, the pros and cons and will do a speedpaint at the end to test it out.
When opening the box the first thing we see are cables a power adapter and an HDMI.
Then there's a stand we'll have to fix to the tablet
it allows us to draw in tilt up to 90 degrees maximum control over your own preference in angle
we also find a manual of instructions
a cleaning cloth and a half glove with this set
this one has a different design to what
we see nowadays a nice detail
is this protective case for the pencil
since there's no pen holder included in this model we can find a bunch of free nibs
a pen nib remover
the tablet monitor is 21.5 inches
which makes it too big to travel with it or move it around
it's better for a static
use at your usual workspace
it has no buttons for short keys
what makes it better for drawing since any light source could make it annoying otherwise.
it will take you no longer than a minute to do this now
I'll show you all of the connections needed for the proper work of the tablet
everything looks fine so far
let's proceed with installation
we'll be downloading the drivers from the official page and run the Installer
everything works properly and the touch feels
nice pen pressure is also correct
I've decided to do a redraw of a drawing
I did
two years ago when started with the youtube channel some of you might remember when
I did it
I feel like I've improved a lot
and it's thanks to the opportunity
I had drawing on big display if you can afford it
I recommend it to all of you
a size of minimum 13 inches is the best for a proper workflow
less would probably not be as effective
I feel so satisfied with artisul D22S
it gave me no trouble, worked perfectly
fine and the size is just awesome
I did this
drawing in just 3-4 hours compared to drawings
I do for days when the device is uncomfortable also I want to highlight the quality of the display
how colors stay
almost 100% true to reality
the results are extremely pleasant
that's all
I have to comment about the device for now
so you should definitely check it out you
hello everyone in this video
i'll be reviewing this android tablet by vanco
moto is matrix pad s20 and this is worth around 100 250 pound uk currency
it has a lot of features packed into it
and that's something that really stands out excellent build quality
i love the back bit
it has the power button and the volume control
it also takes a 3.5 millimeters headphone jack at the top here
it has two speakers as well so the sound quality is brilliant
i do recommend it
i would say around six up to six hours of usage time
that's still brilliant
it does charge up a lot
so take care of the tablet when you buy it
the cable is not that long
the touchscreen is brilliant
generally this is a brilliant tablet for gaming
brit is brilliant for web serving for anything
i would say this tablet is brilliant and also it has a ips display with a built-in bluetooth 5.0
um operating system so you can download majority of the thing
unlock weight of this is 525 um grams
so it's not that heavy
now if you go on settings everything on this is exactly like an android tablet
so you've got all the features like android
i'd like to go to the storage so i want to show you now without downloading anything
i went from the registration
i skipped everything to the main menu
and it's already used up eight gigs
so from a gig you got around 56 gig to use to download anything or use it
it'll use up
you've got a security and location where you can use face unlock
now let me go back you go
um google system languages you can change the languages there as well about tablet etc now
this is a tablet that i would say is worth every penny and i would highly recommend it
it's a tablet that wouldn't overheat has amazing build quality

well good enough community who order hurry awkward
I had I could apparently I could have the the coded
Oh plop and floppin I
Buland put up to join blend blend cat
what is going on guys
Greg Oh Stevie this is the Vanco matrix pad
z17 inch tablet actually runs android 8.1
go edition which is like a simplified version of Android operating system
which will allow you to get a hundred ditional 128 gigabytes of storage per
I can't see because it's kind of dark but up here there's gonna be a headphone jack
it's nothing else on
which gives you about eight hours
the screen resolution is not that high
it's 1024 by 600 which matches what you would get on the the fire tablet
they're 7 inch tablet
which goes for that one goes for 50 bucks
this tablet goes for 65 bucks
I said for books
it's fantastic
it's a book
another thing you might want to do on
here is watch videos now
this tablet is not a speed demon so loading up apps you can see
it's ok not that loud
it's a single firing speaker
the viewing angles are okay on this
you can definitely see the screen
I mean it could be better but it's for 65 bucks
it's not too bad another thing you might want to do on
oh oh man
it's scary with this guy
oh you got me but yeah you can see it
plays the game fairly well
doesn't have any issue with it but again it's not a game
it's not a tablet
it has the search bar with the microphone
two is a little bit interesting
you have a volume key here but this was kind of funny and you have a volume up as well
you also have a back button home button
and then recent apps button say recent apps when they pull up are going to be up and down
they're not going to be sideways the way they are on most other devices
so you notice the normal ones
screenshot storage
all that kind of thing that you would like
the other interesting thing is does not come with any bloatware which is wonderful
I said I wouldn't probably take any photos with it
it doesn't do video like I said but you can see
I'll open up some photos that I took so these are some photos that I took with this
that was with the front camera
it's okay
I mean you can definitely get a photo out of it
this is with the control over the light on when I turn the light off you can see
it doesn't really have good dark light photos in there so overall this tablet is gonna be great
I would think for somebody that loves to read books
that doesn't want to spend a lot compared to the fire tablet
it runs a lot of the same
you know hardware specs or similar to it as the fire tablet
it does have more storage on here
you get the whole
it's just an overall in for 65 bucks
it's don't expect a speed demon of a tablet
you're not going to get that
it's gonna be a tablet
have it be you know looking at a website or playing a game
it's not what it's going against
it's going against the Fire tablet
you can get this for you know a few dollars more fifteen dollars more
you can get this tablet so if you want to pick it up
I'll link it down below if you have any questions or comments
leave those down below
thanks for watching guys
I'll see you down the road Poots
hi guys and welcome back to another product review
today we're gonna be looking at a new tablet from the company
mio cuore
you may recognize the name from the past
we previously reviewed their a1 and old version of the n1
but today we're gonna be looking at the new 2019 and one tablet
what's in the box and give you our top six features of this new
N 1 2019 Edition tablet
so first of all
let's open the box and see what's inside okay so straight out the box
we have the tablet itself
we have an instruction manual
we have our warranty card with all the repair information
we have a USB charging cable and we have our USB charging plug
okay it's worth mentioning
so if you don't like the product within 100 days you can return it and they'll be here
there'll be no charge whatsoever
okay so now we've seen what's in the box
I want to talk about my six favorite features of the n120 19 edition first up
we have this huge lovely great-looking screen okay and for the money you're getting a 10.1
now support 400 gigabyte
that's one of the latest versions
so that's absolutely fantastic to get a budget tablet with the latest operating system again
Oreo and it's absolutely fantastic
and a pleasure to use
I really like it
it's a big jump up from some of the older versions of Android and yeah fantastic
that neo core are pushing this to their recent devices so another big thumbs up okay
point number four mini
HDMI absolutely fantastic
it's a brilliant feature and white isn't featured on
they're saying ten hours which is absolutely fantastic
they've got fantastic battery life and unlike other
Amazon tablets that we've reviewed and had when you put it to sleep
and you've got a hundred days to return it if you're not happy with a product
I know I said I was going to make six points that I liked about the tablet
I do want to throw in one more bonus point there that I had forgotten about
and that is the pre-fitted screen protectors on all of their tablets
so when they come out of the box straight away you can have a screen protector on there
I don't know if like me
you find it
an absolute mission to put on screen protectors
I think you're getting a fantastic tablet for the money
you're getting nice large screen
good storage options
take care bye for now
hi this is
just a tablet
standalone tablet does not come with a keyboard not a detachable keyboard
promo s is a tablet operating system
I'm also running this on developer channel software something
69 is because we get this nice touch screen friendly
there are front and rear cameras
they're pretty lousy
I wouldn't really recommend using them for anything
Arak chip our k33 nine-nine processor it's a six core
we can open up a couple of tabs here
it's not what I meant to do though
video playback works nicely
I've used it for Netflix
like use it for YouTube
I've used it for
plex watched a full video on it gets around 9 hours of battery life 9 to 10 hours of battery life
Chromebook that's one of the things that makes this sort of tablet
specific another is that
you've got this little back button down here on most screens
it's sort of a little bit more like a cross between Android and Chrome OS in some ways
now there is a multitasking button
here and there is support for multiple windows of chrome
so let's open a second one here and say open the New York Times website
and if you wanted to do split-screen you can do that
now you notice it doesn't resize perfectly here so let's go ahead and reload that page and then
reckon support resizing
sometimes they'll just want to take up the whole screen now
we can flip back to full screen here pretty easily just by dragging it over
so that's a little bit of sort of multitasking split screen and I'll show you
you have a couple of different options there
now it's a stylus device and so
I think some things that they might want to do here involve using that stylus
so let's go ahead and switch back to portrait mode
pull out the stylus and say we want to create a note
I'm not really sure what's going on there
you can change it to others
I need to choose input with a pen
so it's kind of a slow way to enter text
it's not mostly something
Google's a quick draw web app
this just runs in a website
you use your fingers but it's a little bit easier with the pen it says
let's draw a teddy bear so Charlie sure I can draw a scorpion
let's just go ahead draw a beard
okay that should be a little bit easier oh
I know I see circle or blueberry or lollipop more for crappy
oh you got it okay anyway so using the pen you can sort of go through games like this
palm rejection is a little bit finicky
some apps seem to work better than others with it
you can use it for reading
so here for instance is an attack on
they're relatively easy to reset if anything goes wrong
I have a whole separate video
there we go so
I've got LibreOffice
I've got a note
tricky and overall performance can lag and the device can lock up now
I'm running beta Channel software
it doesn't necessarily matter that this isn't as compact as it could be
that's done text
but it includes a pen it includes the full
it definitely has a feel of a work in progress
but it's it's coming along and it's something that's that's worth keeping an eye on
I really for the most part enjoy using this device when I spend $329 on it
I don't know it depends
not just the screen mode and I prefer a built-in keyboard husband for something
that was a tablet specific device
I usually prefer something a little bit smaller than nine point seven inches something
it's a little bit easier to hold in my hand and that's why
I use a relatively inexpensive
Amazon Fire HD 8 as my primary tablet for those purposes but for the education market
so that's the Chromebook Tab 10 this spradlin derp with little buting
wow what's this a tablet review really
are you kidding me
there are hundreds of these out
what are you doing get up okay
i know i know
just watch the video all right
i have things to say so i've been doing digital art for about four years now and over that time
i've tested out a bunch of tablets and i've deduced
i'm incredibly picky
about what tablets i like
the only tablet i really liked was actually my first tablet
this thing was awful
this tablet was way too
clunky had loads of wires in the back that the sand rested on yet to charge the pens
i couldn't even see what i was
drawing part of the screen just didn't work
this thing just sucked
chibi actually made a really good video
about what huion tablets are actually like so
their tablets look really nice
and it's not a huey on tablet
the tablet is really nicely packaged
you got the main screen with seven customizable buttons and a wheelie thing
this tablet's lifetime
the glove is also really nice
it's maybe a bit big for me but keep in mind
i have really small hands so if you get it you should be fine
the cables are very easy to set up
my huion had out the back
this is my article tablet compared to my other two tablets you can tell
it's a really good size
the screen is really nice and doesn't reflect anything
unlike my huion does the driver is pretty easy to set up
you just download it off
the website restart your computer
make sure all the things are set up properly with the driver and then you're good
it works really well when drawing
it's got such good pen pressure sensitivity
it just feels like you're doing naturally on paper
i found that it works almost perfectly fine
just like my old tablet
it just didn't work well but only for the pencil
i looked around trying to fix it but i just couldn't find much
i messed around in the driver
i mean it's not perfect but it's good enough for me and keep in mind
i used this tablet for half of this map
amv it's a reader of one of the frames in it
you should really go give it a watch
it's one of the best amv's i've seen in a very long time overall
this is a really great tablet especially for the price
it's a great size easy to move around the setup and a lot of fun to work on
okay thank you so much for watching
hi my name's
Adelle and this is my son Jacob
hi we are from our family
LiveCode at UK
and we've teamed up with curio and internet matters to talk to you about the kirio tap connect
it's a 7-inch Android tablet
it's got this protective bumper
its splash proof it's got Wi-Fi bluetooth
it's absolutely brilliant one thing
I really like about it is that it's actually got curio genius on it
you set up a parent profile account
uh you don't have permission to use apps right now
I'll try again later
if you've got a phone you can actually download the curio connect app
once you're connected you can actually send them pictures
you can send the messages you can send emojis
there's also a kiddo store all aimed at kids you know educational fun games
it also has child safe browsing this actually filters out over 32 billion web pages
that is a lot that is a lot so what
we hope you enjoyed this video for more help and information go to curate
well calm and internet matters bottle
thanks for watching bye
greetings everyone Eric
here and welcome back to another product review in this one
so right off
the bat huion was gracious enough to send this to me
but this is not sponsored - didn't pay me and yeah they wanted me to review this and say okay
let's just let's just get the pleasantries out of the way
this is the tablet
you might be wondering to yourself man
that box is small
is that really a tablet there
I'm um I'm opening the box
which first you get a little little thank-you card which is pretty nice
there's the tablet
it's a very small tablet
also up here
you have the pen
which does require one triple-a battery
oh that's a good
I said this is gonna be mostly a talking head video
so if you don't care about the visuals and you just want to listen
go to the website and get the drivers
oh wow it even has like like mac and Windows versions but yeah for an unboxing
it's super simple
and so yeah
this is kind of weird for me as you
anyone who's watched my videos before knows that
I'm not very fond of graphics tablets
and that's what this is
this is a graphics tablet the difference between this a graphics tablet when
I'm used to which is I think you can see
let me touch it
let me touch me
yeah this thing right here
this black bit over here
here you see behind me
it is a monitor it lights up
tablets are not like that you plug this in through USB
I have ever held
I'm gonna read off the options that they say that this is designed for pen signer
industrial design nice
osoo which is a kind of a
I've never played it and then I guess
apparently there's two models there's the H for 20 and the 420 high blades it
the H for 20 apparently has three buttons on it
so if you want to upgrade to get a little bit more to get some buttons on it that's fine
I see where the 420 comes from four by two point twenty
three resolution is four thousand lines per inch
it's got a report rate of 200
because it's so small
every little microbe movement translates to a big movement on screen depending on your resolution
but if you're using like 1080p or even 720 every little motion will be a drastic motion on screen
I think that this is for kind of a big for someone who's a professional artist
who's like trying to you know do
Commission work or works in a business and stuff like that if this is going to be
I don't think this would be your main tablet
if you're a pixel artist you can do kind of small movements and stuff like that
this is very inexpensive
I actually would recommend taking a look at this now
I know Coppa
but it's probably gonna get in the way here and say oh
you're directing of the kids no
it's again $15 it's really easy to pick up and it's good to have around like
I would have no problem giving them this and saying here
try it out
see what you like
I'll make screen tablets um but anyway
yeah this is a weird one but I want to thank you all for stopping by and watching
if you enjoyed the video give it a thumbs up
make sure you use the subscribe sub scribe and hit the little
Bell notifications to stay up to date on all my videos and content down in the description
you'll find a link to this tablet so if you want to check it out
Twitch I'm gonna try to get back into doing live streams but anyway enough rambling
all right i got this new tablet and it is a wonderful size
i mean i just love it
um it's got a very nice high-end camera and it just it runs beautiful
i'm gonna
i play asphalt 9
i mean this actually rolls really good
uh with about anything
i mean
it's fast you see
how fast that came up
um i'm just going to pop over here to youtube real quick
look how fast that loads
isn't that unbelievable
that's really good
uh internet connection just really nice internet connection
um i don't know what all we got going on here
let me see but i mean it goes through
that's really nice
um it did updates as soon as i signed on and started loading it up
music is really good
i mean for that size
it sounds really nice
um i mean it handles the memory chips
um i don't know what more to say about it other than it's it's you know
even my netflix
i was going to bring up my netflix
just so how nice that is and it sounds sounds real
i mean it there it it doesn't
it's just seamless
it runs really smooth
that's fast
um it's just a robust little tablet
i'm really impressed with it
really happy with it
that's just awesome
now this is a tablet that is designed to replace all your notebooks
so you can write on this tablet you can read pdfs
they want that organic feeling of writing
you have of course the remarkable two tablet
you have the stylus with it which we will get onto a bit later on then
you also have replacement tips for the stylus
now let's get on to the actual tablet so this is the thinnest tablet in the world
it is 4.7 millimeters thin
the experience is nice for me
personally it does not feel like writing on paper there is friction
i wouldn't complain that oh this doesn't feel nice
your palm won't interfere with the writing on the tablet so the whole writing
experience is quite accurate
now let's talk about the actual interface
there are very few features but all of them are very useful
black gray and white the eraser function is also really cool so you can erase a selection
you can copy and paste little sections onto different notebooks and different pages
the undo and redo feature is of course really cool something that naturally
if you're writing in a notebook you wouldn't be able to do so
it's a bit like a notebook but on steroids
then another really cool thing is the convert to text feature
so say you're done writing your thoughts
you can quickly convert text and send it to yourself via email now this
i'm a bit hesitant to use because when i did use it once um it messed up some of the words
i'm not that neat
you can also choose different languages and if you are not right-handed but you are left-handed
you are in the minority
it still caters to that now
i use it every day multiple times a day
i can't remember the last time i took out my notebook and pen and started writing with that also
whoever i've shown this to so for example my sister she absolutely loves it
she wants one so everybody i've shown this to they
it doesn't feel like using a samsung tablet
even a phone but now let's go on to some areas for improvement so firstly the pen tips
i wore out my first pen tip within about two to three months
that's not too bad but i just expected the pen tips to last longer
also do not give this device to kids they will f it up
they will take the pen tips and smash it and your pencil will be gone within like a minute
because then you can just be done with it in the tablet
all these features
i think would just help everything
be in one place overall
i think this is a great device
without going overboard it is definitely pricey
it's 400 pounds
you can get a tablet with way more features but what this device offers is something unique
you don't have to carry around a bunch of different notebooks
like one is my diary
one is for youtube video planning so
that's pretty much it for this week's video
if you enjoyed it give it a thumbs up
share it with your friends and subscribe to my channel for weekly content
hello guys i am nia and i'm here to do this review video of vague x-640 as you can see
it's a normal tablet
you can use it for drawing playing also and online teaching
it's a normal tablet
we do the considerations watching the drawing process that i've made using vague establish
i really like this tablet because it's small
uh it's not too big for my desk and it's 8 000 levels of pressure guys 8 000
it's a lot and it is nice
it's soft straw as you can see
i really like the fix tablet
besides you can draw on your cell phone
i never was able to draw my my cell phone
this tablet is my recommendation to people who want to start drawing digital art
it is cheap
it is simple no secrets and 8 000 levels so enjoy the rest of the video and thank you so much you
welcome to tau to connect today
this is a 7-inch 800 x 480 screen
capacitive screen has a 16 29 widescreen ratio
nothing here has two external speakers it has a docking port
are these three buttons here on the bezel
there's a home button mini button in a back button
unfortunately they are not backlit so in the dark
you're not going to be able to see these buttons
so let's just turn this on and you does use android 2.0
so you would see it's a basic
it's very basic
it has some apps listed here on the bottom
okay one complaint that we had and hopefully there will be a firmware update
that will fix
this is the responsiveness of the screen
it's really not as responsive as we will hope especially from a capacitive screen
so this is definitely something that we're very disappointed with as you can see
the responsiveness is not really that great
and it's definitely something that's very disappointing
you can see that
it's not as responsive as we want but let's go to the browser
i'm going to use skyfire
which is our preferred browser of course anything better than stock browser
it's going to make your your interview in
Europe is going to make your internet viewing a better experience for right
now it's just loading here
okay there we go okay
let's just go to the New York Times website okay
these there's obviously debate whether 7-inch or anything from nine to 10 inch tablet is ideal
we have had experience obviously with the epad
I guess
disillusion and how small this really is compared to to a 10-inch tablet
so as you can see there's not much real estate on here
their is no flash again
this is the issue
that we're having with the responsiveness of the tablet
okay here we go alright so again
it's a two-point no it's doesn't support
we believe 1600 megahertz
let's go back to home page
which will be a little better and you can actually see the pinch to zoom in action
usually our internet connection is not this slow
I guess there's a lot of people on online today
the stock browser the pinch to zoom does not work on the stock browser
just for your information and let's go back there
we go again
let me apologize for again the delay in the the Wi-Fi connection here
we haven't had any issues with that
let's go back to again the home
okay page now
we're going to show you the multimedia functions
well don't have any problems again
there is no pinch to zoom in here as you can see
the external speakers do work well with music
didn't have any problems with that now
I'll show you some videos here
now this is an HD 720 just want to show you that it actually does render the video
well no problems at all at least with this file
now we do have problems with this 720 video you watch again
this is the under power processor
that just really has a hard time processing this
i think it was a 1.3 version of the app
gigahertz am or 11 processor the image in the resolution which were significantly better
in here again you can see how pixelated it is
the struggle that this processor has so no matter what video you try to look at it
it just gives you a poor resolution of it
and that's very disappointing
that velocity micro chose this processor for their tablet this does not come with any of the
Android apps that the suite of Android apps obviously google android market
but that's very limited in here
mind that if you will use the cruise market do not use
the any other browsers accepts a stock browser
it is very limited
obviously there's not many apps here one thing
excuse to try to increase the number of so-called apps on their market
unfortunately it's it's disappointing $300 for this
the quality is very good on this though
that's one thing
I must say it does appear to be glass
the back has a rubber-like material which prevents scratching and also to have a better
so that's a big plus on this but again this is just a summary for the full detailed review again
visit our website where you could get for the details and pull the testings that we have done so
thank you very much for watching talak connect
let's look at the hardware a little bit so the nova has a flush front screen
it's got a single back button below the screen uh smudge prone back
you got a speaker on the back as well
it adds a micro sd card slot both have usb c ports and then on the back
it's just got kind of like rounded edges
uh so i do like the design of the pocketbook
it's nice and comfortable to hold
the onyx is a little bit more tablet-like a little bit heavier with that glass screen
it also has a wacom touchscreen and comes with the stylus so it adds a lot more functionality
i loaded up
i just wanted to compare the page turns initially because the pocketbook
it's really slow to turn pages as you can see here
the the onyx is much faster
what i saw was even more interesting is the color is completely different on these two devices
they have the exact same ink
uh screen the new colladio plus screen
so i find it interesting that uh i mean the screens
look so completely different as you can see here so yeah
the puck look a little bit slow to respond here
we got to get back a couple of pages um so we get the same page here
yeah totally different colors on these two
so one thing about the onyx is it
has this color control in here where you can control the contrast and the color saturation
so let's just keep that down for this comparison
i got the saturation halfway up
yeah you can definitely see how much brighter it is right now than it was by default
so let's load up a different comic here
um so like this page is a little bit interesting like on the pocketbook
it almost looks like the colors
it doesn't have the best refresh so you have to kind of refresh it
it has a lot of ghosting
i actually have a setup to minimize ghosting
you still get quite a bit of ghosting
we'll talk about that a little bit more in a second but yeah i don't know it's just interesting
how different the colors are on these two devices
look at this completely different color
when you're using onyx's you know customizable contrast or color saturation settings so yeah
i find it very interesting that how different these two screens look
even though they have the same screen so like i was saying with the onyx
i don't have any ghosting problems on the pocketbook so i got a lot more
ghosting problems on the onyx
you got to have go in here and set it to do a deep refresh every page
so um that's one thing that pocketbook definitely has an advantage on
so yeah the refresh is definitely better on the pocketbook
how these two devices with the same screen can perform so differently
another thing i notice is like a text balloons with the onyx
see how much darker the text is they have more of a contrast control
they do this on their system-wide like contrast control where like the text is a bit darker
you don't have control over that kind of stuff
so let's talk about the text
here's sort of a similar layout with the text
here i also noticed the text looks darker on the onyx than it does on the pocketbook
when you're using just a regular ebook we got
the front light turned off right here
they have a boldness option
you control the contrast separately from boldness whereas the pocketbook
it just has a boldness option so when you go bold
i've kind of find that it's just too thick
different color on the onyx
i say it's a little more neutral on the pocketbook
front lights vary so much from one to the next though
i tried it with a capacitive stylus
it didn't work very well
you had to press down really hard
i mean so
it's linux based
they have a few different reading apps
you can install on this
someone told me that you can install a reading or a a viewer app
image viewer app
that will make the uh comics a lot faster
the puck book is like 90 cheaper than the onyx which is significant
so um i mean it can get the job done if you wanted a color e-reader but again with the onyx
thank you guys for watching
check out the main reviews if you'd like to see a little bit more in depth for these devices
thank you guys for watching goodbye
this is a Smart Tab 2 in 1 tablet as you can see
here is the front of the box the top the side the other side
and you have the back in the back
you got all the specifications for the tablet itself but this
I would explain that on in the video
so yeah they stopped buying boxing
this tablet with my knife here
ok go cut the other side
that's pretty much it
let me put this knife away first so I don't not want to stab myself on the side just tap out
oh oh the whole box comes out
yeah as you can see you
it's like a box inside the box with inside
of course um oh this far
ok this is the tub itself it is pretty heavy
we got the books
pick this out see here or just patience
this is to charge the tablet and to transfer files to the tablet as well so put all this back side
um let's start by buying unsealing
the tablet itself okay so
I got this plastic
and oh yeah it smells like plastic all right
Oh son of a okay
so let's start by dripping okay
here's your tab here just just just rip it like that as you can see
this is the front it does have a matte finish to it hasit material
it's like so so got the back
I got the bottom of the tablet and of course if you open it up
oh wow that is stiff right there
that is okay
that's how far it goes
I don't know you could hear this
it's like this crackling sound
wow it sounds weird but yes
it's the tab itself before
I start here the main specs for this tablet that I will show later on on the video
okay so the screen size of the tablet is 10.1 inches the resolution is the IPS
display of 800 by 1280
it's a 64 intel quad core processor with a 1 gigabyte of RAM and 4 hours of battery life
we also have a 0.3
ok so on the front we have the power and the volume buttons on the right side
we got the microphone
the head jack micro USB DC slot with the reset button all this button
we have nothing on the other side
we have the second speakers on the top
we have the front camera you know for some reason
megapixels and in the front was 0.3
we have the two rubber grippers
this part right here is made of a plastic so this material does not grab the bottom of the tablet
where are your apps are at
basically at any time you want we also have the options to UM forward backwards and pan
it did not work with this video so
I'm guessing this is meant for music playing
this these options will not work only the playing pause
we also have the mute option
this basically just turns off your screen having it to go to sleep one thing
I do not like about this mouse
pad is that it cannot be clicked like a normal mouse pad
sometimes the mouse pointer will not land on that specific item
since the mouse pad is a bit jet-lagged
now let's test out the web browsing
let me start shop
Amazon okay so the keyboard keys are a tad bit small
I will say a couple millimeters smaller than the normal size laptop keyboard using the trackpad
truly lags out the web browsing even using the touchscreen as well zooming into pages
okay as you can see here
this speaker does not work so only this one does playing videos on this advice
it's pretty good actually
now let's test out both of the cameras and see how they compare
there'll be times where it will feel like the tablet will lag or slow down but for the most part
I ran the game pretty decently
I'm pretty sure if I kept on playing this game
it will heat up
I got around 2 to 3 hours of gameplay overall
this tablet did a very decent job
but is it really worth $80
not really maybe if it was 20 to 25 dollars less
hello internet world
welcome to a new video on the geeky noise channel in today's video
i'm going to be sharing my opinion about this android tablet
this is the dragon
touch max 10 running google android
it's got a 10.1
inch ips screen really great specs
it was sent in free of charge by the manufacturer for me to review
just give a little quick look at the box so really nice box and packaging
it's also got an optical processor now you can expand the storage if i just quickly actually
we've also got just at the top here
we've got a memory card slot so you can expand the memory on the top edge
also you have got a usbc charging port as you can see and then on the side here
we've got the power on off button
we've also got volume up and down and the rest of the edges are pretty much clear
apart from a couple of speakers at the bottom
the speakers are pretty good on this one uh also of no is there is some texture on these sides
let me just unlock this again and put my uh passcode in
i don't want that on camera and here we go
we are unlocked so it's just a passcode unlocked
there's no face recognition or anything like that on this one but that's acceptable at this price
point is an extremely extremely good price point
now you'll have noticed lately
i like covering these budget devices
and that is purely
it's mainly the google apps that are pre-installed
no sort of bloatware
a good selection of apps pre-installed on this also
the screen does go very very bright
let's just pop this brightness up
we're at mid brightness
nice resolution pin sharp display now it mentions ips on the uh sort of spec sheet
i think it is an ips display
but you do get some color shift when you're looking at it off angle but it's not too bad
it's pretty good viewing angles
you can also see that screen rotating
actually let's concentrate on this a little bit better
really cool indeed
now it does come pre-installed as well with a screen protector
so that's really nice
nice nice build quality as well
i really do like the build quality
the primary build quality on the side is plastic
you've got some grip along this bottom edge
so some nice texture there
it's a matte finish on the back and the cameras aren't fantastic
of course then
this is well worth considering
i've been using it mainly for a little bit of social media browsing the internet
it's a really nice experience
stage just removing the screen protector overall
though it's a very very nice product really great great value for money
so this is the drug dragon touch max 10
i think it's a very very nice budget
pocket friendly android tablet that still delivers a great experience
nice size screen and overall very impressed with it
then this is well worth checking out
so that's it for the review

hi guys welcome on
Silk Road Channel today
I want to show you down on as 56k tablet that I got for free to test it
ok let's start inside box
it is flexible so it won't break easily in my opinion
this tablet is better than my previous one but there are little things that I would change
I also wait to change battery in our pants sometimes
but that's not a big deal
this is really nice tablet but you need to get used of it
I think that I've said everything about this tablet
hope you enjoyed the video
make sure to leave a like and subscribe see ya
hi everyone
and they haven't paid me any money or anything to give any positive reviews
they fear leader
sent me the tablet for me to give my honest opinion in this video
so that's what I'm going to do
we'll pick two winners to win those 580 tablets
I'm so sorry
this is not available to everyone in the world
I wish it could be
but that's just the way
the shipping fees work
unfortunately inside the box
the first thing is a thank-you note from Shu
Yan and underneath that is the tablet itself and I was actually really impressed
it looks awesome
it looks very stylish and very professional having the twelve buttons along
the left side looks great as well underneath
that is a bag for storage and for traveling
they provide the rechargeable pen which again looks amazing
the build quality on both the pen and the tablet is super impressive
the tablet has a ten by six point
two five inch active area with 2048 levels of sensitivity it also has 12
they're extremely helpful
the tablet comes with eight gigs of memory on a micro
SD card which comes in extremely handy
it's also super impressive
it's something that
I'm going to try and bring to the channel this year
it works absolutely perfectly
I didn't notice any issues at all
I'm really glad that I got this opportunity
because this tablet has been so fun to use so huge
thank you to
if you enjoy drawing and painting videos then make sure to subscribe and any likes or shares on
this video are hugely appreciated as always another huge
thank you to who yawns
for supporting the channel by sending with tablets it was so much fun to use and
I really appreciate the opportunity
thank you so much for watching this video
I hope you're having an amazing day and I'll see you all soon you
hi everyone and welcome back today
I'm going to be doing a review and demo of the sim bans Picasso tab
this is an entry-level
Android multifunction tablet aimed primarily at beginners to digital art and students
it comes with both a pressure-sensitive pen and a case in the video
thank you to some bands for sending me
this tablet to test out in review
this is not a sponsored video but they were kind enough to send me the tablet
so thank you very much to them for that as always with my reviews
my thoughts and opinions are 100% honest and my own
the tablet comes well packaged in a nice box
there are a few different bits and pieces
a drawing glove is also included
then there's the pen which is battery-operated and the box contains two batteries
the tablet itself is not as thin or as light as other tablets
I've placed a layer of plastic over the tablet screen
just because the tablet was reflecting everything and in order to film
I had to come up with a solution for the video
so that's why there's a layer of plastic over the tablet
the tablet does come with a screen protector
the tablet is 10 inches
it has a front and a back camera it has 32 gigabytes of disk space and 2 gigabytes of RAM
the tablet fits into the case really snugly and one of the things
everything is included in one box and I really liked that
the case felt pretty well made to me
it protected the tablet really
the pen also feels really nice in the hand
it's very similar in size to a regular ballpoint pen
to the case the setup for the tablet was really easy
Play and things like that
I very much enjoyed working in Autodesk
it could do everything I want
it even had a line straightening feature which
I used when I did the line
art portion of my drawing today
I like to make several test pages when I first start using a new program or device
there's always a little bit of time
the pen comes with 1024 levels of pressure and I was really pleased with the variation I got
I got a lot of really good line variation when I was using the pen
now part of the pressure levels can be adjusted within the drawing app so in
I liked that the pen was small
it felt very comfortable in my hand
it felt very much like a regular pen
it glided across the screen very well and the only thing
I didn't like about the pen was the fact that it took batteries
I'd prefer a rechargeable pen
rêveur cable the performance of the pen was very good and I liked how light and small
the pen was especially compared to some of my other digital stylus pens
the tablet is meant to have palm rejection
so when you're drawing the screen won't recognize the side of your hand and make marks
you don't want on your artwork
I found this feature to actually be very good
I didn't have any trouble with this but I have seen a couple of other reviews on YouTube
talk about the palm rejection not working very well for them
didn't need to
you're using and turn on the right settings it's the same with the pressure sensitivity
not all apps and brushes are pressure sensitive
I found that sketching things on the tablet was really enjoyable
I still do love the feel of a pen and paper though so I am a little torn between the two
the tablet is so easy to use and to sketch and to rework things but I also do love
the tablet definitely did have a little bit of lag
I noticed it more at the beginning but as I was working
it really didn't bother me
I didn't find the lag to be bad at any point
rotating the canvas was definitely slower once
I added more layers
I thought it was good when I placed the pen down on the screen
you may be noticing during the sketching phase of this drawing
is that some of my lines of wobbly
this is because I'm using a very small brush and I'm zoomed out too far
when i zoom in further the lines are much better and smoother
the screen resolution was not the best
you can sketch you can watch YouTube
you can download apps
I think this tablet is really good
yes there's a little bit of lag it's small but there is a little bit and yes
I've been as I mentioned earlier
testing out the tablet for a couple of weeks and it's been really useful for my workflow
I've been using it for sketching and I've also been using it for watching YouTube videos
I've also found the move ability of the tablet really useful
then this tablet could be a good fit for you
it's not going to replace my
I don't have to sit at my desk all the time which is really nice
so that's about it for the review today to sum up
I think the tablet is good value for the price point
it's not going to have the resolution or the power than a much
more expensive tablet will have but as an entry level tablet
I think it's really good
I was very pleased with its performance
I could create sketches and finished illustrations
it was nice to work on
the pen was good and it comes with a case as well
what's happening everyone
my name is alex and welcome back in today's video
we are checking out the latest affordable tablet from vast king called the kingpad k10 pro
so this tablet is powered by an octa-core cpu
that's paired with 4 gigs of ram and 64 gigs of internal storage
that are wondering
but we'll talk more about that later on in the video
i feel the screen looks great
the colors are nice and vibrant
the viewing angles are really good
we have a six thousand milliamp hour battery and on one charge
you can type easier if you're writing a long email or a paper for school
the back of the tablet is not gonna get damaged so for the price
i'm not a big fan of drawing on tablets
it is a bit on the heavier side
so if you'd be to compare this to an ipad
i feel that this feels a bit um heavier in hand at the top here
we have a 3.5 mil audio jack
as i said we have that done slot for the sd card on the left hand side
here we have the power button and the volume keys and the usbc charging port and the bottom
we have two speakers
so it's a good thing that we have dual speakers
we have a 8 megapixel camera so those cameras are definitely useful
so let's hear that is hello
this is a quick example
so this is a recording done with a front facing camera on this tablet
they're not using a heavy launcher on top of that android 10.
the launcher looks very close to stock on android so nothing holding up the tablet back
i've seen other tablets in the past that have these strange launchers that are pretty heavy
well that's not the case with this one
the tablet also doesn't company installed a bunch of useless apps
everything works pretty smooth mostly taking in consideration
how affordable this tablet is with that four gigs of ram
that we have
you can also do some multitasking
so for example
if you want to do a split screen you can
but everything that i've done with it does seem to work on pretty decent
i've tried facebook on it
i've tried the browser
i was also able to play call of duty now
call of duty works
but i don't think i would use this tablet for um call of duty that much
i mean this is not exactly a gaming device and even though you can do it
the experience isn't going to be as good as a more expensive tablet
something that has a more powerful um processor and gpu but gaming is possible as well
it's um found your location
it doesn't seem um to lose it
the tablet also supports dual band wi-fi so of course
if you're using the five gigahertz wi-fi band you will get better
everything you get in the box for that money i feel that
this tablet offers really good value
not to mention this is much more powerful than the last fasting tablet
i've tried maybe like four months ago now
of course there are some more powerful tablets available on the market
with the tablet this will do great for facebook for watching videos for browsing the web
i think this will do great all right guys
hopefully you enjoyed this video
thanks for watching and i will see you in the next one
hey guys the CTA Prime back here again today
we're gonna be taking a look at a really inexpensive 2 in 1 laptop slash tablet from
I own a couple mini laptops with this chip and I think it's a great performer
if you can get it for the right price
I'm not expecting much from this
it has a 10.1 inch screen
we also have the keyboard attachment which makes this a two-in-one and it feels really heavy
it actually feels like this should have an extra battery in it but I don't believe it does
you're gonna receive the charger and I believe this came with a stylus
it's known as a smart stylus
I mean it's definitely all made of the plastic but this little crooked
Celeron sticker is really bugging me
it's not an extra battery
I think the PCB is kind of hanging off inside of here
that's not a good sign
the keyboard does attach to the tablet with these little magnets here
it'll disconnect the keyboard from the tablet even when
this is a dual-core
CPU at one
point one gigahertz but we do have a burst
up to 2.6 the GPU is the built-in Intel UHD 600 for gigabytes of lpddr4
RAM at 21
33 megahertz this is non-user upgradeable and is soldered to the mainboard
it's 802 that 11n Wi-Fi plus bluetooth 4.0
and this whole system is running
it's definitely not the best screen in the world but for an $80 tablet
with this tablet another thing would be the 32 gigabytes of internal storage now
is this keyboard not working even at $80
this keyboard should attach and it should work right out of the box
plus there's a copper pad on the back casing
you might notice some fingerprints here
these are my fingerprints
I simply pulled this apart and this is what was here from the factory in most assembly plants
they use gloves but I don't think they're using them where they're assembling these
Evo's so the screen on this thing really isn't that bad touch sensitivity and the image quality
so it will be a bit slower than if it was running in
PCIe mode the only time
this device does have dual stereo speakers
you so here
it is before we get into the testing
it's around eighteen hundred for the single core and three thousand for multi
so we're right on spot with the multi but single core is much lower
I figured I'd test out some PC games
first up
we have csgo 720p all low settings get an average of around fifteen
at least that's what afterburner saying
I can never get sound out of HDMI with this
specific game
720p low settings
I turn as much as I could down
we're getting average of 24 fps rocket
Li 720p although settings average 19 there was one game that performed quite well
but that's pretty much a given this thing runs on pretty much everything
and that's minecraft
this is actually the Windows Store version either way
it runs great on this little chip
set moving over to some emulation first up
we have some dreamcast using the re dream emulator this is
Dead or Alive to get in the constant 60fps and this redream emulator works great on these end
4000 CPUs PSP is another one that performs pretty decently on the in 4000
this has got a four chains of olympus a harder one to emulate
this is just a harder one to run along with
it's just not going to cut it for GameCube but in the past on other systems with this same chip
there's not a lot of
I mean it does work as a Windows 10 tablet you can check your email
she can get on YouTube
you can play Minecraft with it but I don't see this lasting long especially seeing the issues
I had right out of the box
so if you've been thinking about picking one of these up
I would skip it
so that's pretty much it for this video guys
just let me know in the comments below
so if you're interested in seeing any of those videos let me know in the comments below
thanks for watching you
stuck at home me too
we all are social distancing
means staying at home at least
I get to work from home
my company is still functioning
I'm very grateful and fortunate for that
the kids are home
but there's only so many screens and rooms to go around
it still works
but it's kind of twitchy then my friends at Van Keogh sent me this and it's been a lifesaver now
I'm such a bad liar
okay so let's pretend pretend we're surprised right unbox it
oh it's so clean and then the best part of any new electronics
oh yeah hey you can see my camera rig
okay and look at that
it's already set up for me
there you can see the camera alright
that's a pretty unboxing
thank you for indulging this lie
this is the matrix pad s20 not to be confused with the samsung s 20
speaking of which headphone jack someday these will be history
32 gigabytes internal storage but it's expandable with an SD card up to another 32 gigs
I need to pick one up before my next road trip
I actually have some time
1280 by 800 resolution a 10 inch
IPS display
we've got dual speakers
it's about a hundred and forty dollars on Amazon
it took a few minutes and a few more to install some apps and I was off before the lockdown
so you feel like you're reading a newspaper
it's much more readable than person than it appears
here it doesn't come through very much on camera
they look the same
there's also a mode for eye comfort
that's supposed to make it easier on your eyes for late night
this happens with most devices
the camera loses fine detail and it makes things look like a beauty filter
she looks five years younger doesn't she
I swapped out my trusty
the screen is responsive even with gloves
it's got a good battery life it charges with the USBC connector so be ready for that
if you're still using older microUSB cables ice to stream three to our movies on
Netflix back-to-back with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on when playing movies from the SD card
I got four to our movies with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned off
it's got a strong build
its hefty
it feels good and solid
there is occasional UI lag high-performance games and apps can struggle a bit
the same thing happens on my s10 so who knows
I think the biggest con to this is the lack of accessories like case a screen
protector whenever you have a model that's not super popular like a Samsung or an Apple product
so you might need a universal case
the camera juts out just enough about the width of a piece of paper
so I'm always afraid I'm scratching the lens when I set it down the home
I kind of Miss having a physical home button something I can hit without having to look at it
those are becoming a vestigial feature on other products anyway so
I can't really hold that against this tablet
it's just my fear of change
the camera falls a little short model specific accessories
like cases and screen protectors will be hard to come by
but if you're stuck indoors like me who needs a case anyway
thank you so much for watching
like subscribe comment the
Bell you know usual YouTube stuff
this is the newbie and I'll see you later kids turtles
ask and you shall receive
you guys asked for a more basic
we have the onyx books nova 3 color and on the right we have the ink pad color
the major difference between these two is that the nova is using a glass screen
a truly glass screen not plastic like the ifly tech flush screen
embezzle this one's truly glass as you see on the right here
the ink pad is using the same
shell form factor housing and overall design as the ink pad 3 which is a sunken screen and bezel
so this one's actually dipped down about a millimeter
so it's not actually an exposed screen to the point where you're scratching the actual screen
there are a fair amount of things in the way in fact
the onyx is a fully fledged note-taking android
google play enabled device with audio and video
that's an indisputed fact that you can do more on this than this
but in terms of the overall look and appearance and everything
let's get started on the two here
you will see that
reading is a little bit different and looking at them with your eyes
it is very apparent it
both of the glow lights are off
this is the exact same shot
we did see in our tear down
now it doesn't exactly tell you what most of these are but we do know that it's saturation
you don't want it too dark
this is what manga looks like as well it is very vibrant on both of these again
they're using the exact same screen
you can sideload in your own
adobe whatever the case may be you can put it on here
although both of these display manga beautifully they both do pinch and zoom they
they look very very nice
it actually shines into a layer of thick silicone gel that lays over the entire assembly
they look nearly identical
there's no spillage
the flush screen has nothing to do with it
the sunken screen
it's irrelevant
they both look absolutely fantastic
so the glow lights cannot really be compared or saying one's better than the other
we covered the three basics
the pdfs reading and manga
i mean anything else you want to do with these two can't really be compared
this doesn't have the capability of audio right out of the box without a dongle
you can't watch videos because you don't have any further video modes unlike the onyx
you actually do have three different modes you have speed mode a2 and normal
i don't care what the advertisement campaigns say about either of these two
be it a composite
be it plastic
whatever the case may be this looks a little bit better so weigh the options
check it out if you want to see individual reviews and comparisons on these
this is peter
in this video we're gonna unbox and review the van
Keogh matrix pad s8 edition
the first thing you'll notice is the large 8 inch IPS screen IPS
technology is better than LCD technology because it allows for better viewing angles
Keogh matrix sa tablet is powered by a quad-core CPU
I really love the fact that it's a clean vanilla Android experience
it honestly feels like a pixel device with no bloatware unlike
Samsung which has all this bloatware in general
I'm very impressed with the software experience
it's very light and compact even at 8 inches
it's very easy to hold on one hand
I think this is a really good budget tablet
especially if you want to share this with seniors or kids and for someone like you
it handles all those tasks quite well
it's not too big but it's not too small
I personally use this tablet as an extra monitor when I'm filming with my mirrorless camera
I'm able to connect to the Panasonic image app such that
it allows me to see what my camera sees remotely
it's been very helpful and I really appreciate the larger 8 inch screen anyways
that's it for this review of the Venky
OH matrix patent s8 review
thanks for watching it and I'll see you in the next video
now if you follow my channel you know
now i like that form factor
i like its versatility
i reviewed the thinkpad x1 tablet
that is up until now i took delivery of this
we're going to get into it now
hey everybody it's andrew
i'll check it out in my new series so stay tuned
that's coming soon now for those that do follow my channel
and that was unfortunate because i really loved that two-in-one check out that review
i'm not being paid by lenovo
i'm not being sponsored by lenovo
all the opinions you're about to hear are my own
lenovo is not getting copy approval
they're seeing this video for the first time just like you now
this unit was purchased with my own money
i did not receive a review
unit from lenovo pricing starts at 1097.40
my unit cost 1187.40
now keep in mind
the pen and keyboard are included
let's find out what you get inside the box
let's open it up now
this is typical thinkpad packaging
that's good and as i mentioned you get the keyboard cover
we'll get to that in just a moment
it's a usbc power adapter and it's pretty compact
you also get the extension cord and i love the fact that the pen is included at no additional cost
it uses one quadruple a battery
we'll get into that a little bit later
it has a really nice anti-fingerprint coating on it not too many smudges
i like that now
taking a look at the keyboard
i'm really impressed with it
it has that legendary thinkpad style keyboard with the trackpoint
it also has a precision touchpad
and it's working well so far and yes
the magnetic connection to the keyboard is very secure
you won't be losing it anytime soon
that's good to see
and the kickstand allows you to have a pretty wide viewing angle going down as far as you see here
and speaking of the kickstand very rigid and very sturdy
not too loose
we like to see that especially over the long haul
hopefully that will stay that way and here
it is next to the thinkpad x1 nano i recently reviewed and as you can see
they have a very similar size and similar footprint
a little bit larger display
i'm gonna revisit the surface pro x as i picked it up for less than six hundred dollars
that you do get you could also lay it flat as you see here now
this is an excellent keyboard
all right
let's check out
the ports on the left side is a usbc 3.2 gen1 port and above
that is the sim tray for the optional
lte above that is a thunderbolt 4 port which is good to see and a 3.5 millimeter audio combo
jack moving over to the right side is the kensington
this is the front-facing camera
uh i'm using the rear-facing camera on the x-12 detachable and as you can see let me just show you
what a disaster
this area is look at all these laptops
look at the boxes just thrown around
you know this is the life of the tech reviewer
this is where i sit for my live streams and so forth
there's my green screen
there's the back of the studio which is a total mess with boxes
don't mind the mess that's going to change
i'm going to straighten it up so don't worry about it now
i'd say that the rear facing camera which is an 8 megapixel cameras pretty good and again
it did 1080p video so not bad for a two in one
gotta say that all right
let's check out that display
it's actually pretty gorgeous
its own right now
it does get bright at 390
nits has really good black points
good white points
excellent contrast and it has a low delta e score of 1.68 making this a color accurate display
it also covers the color
gamut really
well you're looking at 92 srgb
plus where you have to pay extra for the keyboard and the pen
that's not the case
no complaints on that front working really well now
the pen doesn't stick magnetically to the side
and that's thanks to that
42 watt hour battery which is a pretty good size for a two in one detachable
life that's something we'd like to see
and the 65 watt usb-c power adapter included charges in about an hour and a half
and that's really fast now
as far as performance is concerned this is running the core i5 1130 g7
detachable is not too bad actually in terms of the numbers as you can see here
don't expect it to be a major powerhouse
but you can get it with up to 16 gigabytes of ram which is non-upgradable meaning
it's soldered into the motherboard and my unit has a gigabyte ssd drive
and here's how it did on the reads and writes on the crystal disk mark test now
they're two front facing speakers
let's wrap it all up
what do i think about the lenovo
thinkpad x12 detachable
i absolutely love it
i love the included excellent keyboard
we get from the thinkpad line here
it really works
considering it is a low-powered tiger lake processor worked really well
i don't think but this is really an excellent competitor
i really liked it a lot
what do you think about this bad boy
the x12 detachable
i really like it
it's got that think pad quality now
it's got the magnesium alloy chassis
now i love the fact that the pen and the keyboard are included
i like the battery life on this
you can pretty much count on all day battery life
i really like the camera on this
it's got an eight megapixel rear facing camera and a front facing camera with five
the rear-facing camera can do 1080p video
that's the lower powered tiger lake processor
it's a bright display
so just keep that in mind but it's good nonetheless but i'm curious to know what you think
let me know in the comment section below so please hit the like button please subscribe
please share this video
don't forget to leave a comment in the comment section below
let me know how i'm doing
let me know if there's a device or something out there you think i should review
i'll do my best to try to make that happen
you might still find it awkward to use on your lap though and in general
I just throw it over a cross-leg to balance it out
lenovo includes its magnetic keyboard
and it's active pen too with the tablet
so you're ready to go out of the box
the backlit keyboard in general
I like the key
you'll probably have trouble using it outside on
one side of the screen are the power and volume buttons and a combo headphone mic
what's a bit of an annoyance though is that lenovo's pin storage solution
what's new is in sigh
1/8 gen intel core i5 processor
you'll get slightly better battery life
we got 6 hours and 27 minutes in our streaming video test
quick editor's note
i still made to some other tablets that are slightly
cheaper are still valid
but keep this in mind as i'm talking about them
this review was supposed to be at the launch of the tablet
but with how crazy this year has been
i'm way behind but i have quite a few things to say here about it
i reviewed last year inside of the box
you get the tablet itself
a bit light for me personally
but that's offset by the overall
nice feel to it
and the tablet only comes with what it needs which to be
honest is quite nice
i really like the surface
feel of this tablet more than anything else
i've used so far even my ipad pro
do make this tablet stand out
i do have two minor complaints off the bat and these held up throughout my testing
the button on the pen is actually quite frustrating to use
i also feel like the four express
keys is a form over function
i think that i can push aside those relatively minor shortcomings
the drawing surface is really
what makes this tablet shine installing
the drivers was also incredibly easy and xp pens
ui is pleasing and intuitive
the pen tilt support which works as well as it does on my ipad pro and on the wacom tablets
i've tested you should be able to use it in any art program without any hassle
the pressure curve is quite nice and responds how i expect it to and overall
i'd say that the drawing experience feels quite nice
the surface just has a very satisfying smooth but slightly grainy natural feel to it
that's difficult to describe
the tablet also boasts android support
i like the tablet
i still think it's a tablet that is worth buying if its strengths fit
what you're searching for
the drivers are reliable
the buttons feel nice
xp pen always seems to be looking to improve their products
and i hope that they'll appreciate some of the feedback i've given here
anyways a big
thank you to xp pen for sending me this tablet to review and being patient with me
i do hope that i'll be able to bring some more xp pen reviews to you in the future
thank you so much for watching
hi everyone this is teo from
pakka blocks calm crayon has sent me and not a tablet to check out this is the Inspiron g 10 key
yes i have already revealed the g
it covers the same things that i'm going to talk about in this video
so let's do a very quick unboxing first the packaging box
is this pot here
let's unbox this quickly to show you
what's inside this is the warranty card
this is a thank you card and this is
the tablet itself is a wireless tablet so it needs to be powered by battery
some finger smudges from my hand
this is the metallic back
the build quality is very solid
this is the most premium looking and feeling tablet that
I have tried from 3 on
so let me click this aside and show you the set arrays
this is the box with manual and driver
CD is pancakes
that has a pen and a wireless receiver
is that a charging cable
there is one charging cable for the pen because the pen is also battery-powered
this is a charging cable for ten
let's take a closer look at the pen case
this is a very solid pen case
this is the 10 it has a nice weight to it
two buttons on the side it has a matte surface texture
this is the remover
there are eight replacement lips provided and this is the USB receiver
this is a bit small so be careful not to lose this
you need to plug this into your computer
in order for the computer to be able to detect wireless tablet
the red light will show up
it's a very comfortable working area for screen that is 20 inches
and so this is the trackpad you can use these to move the cursor around the screen
this is very smooth
I have already installed the driver
I'm using Mac
you have to choose from this drop-down menu some of the woods are not translated properly
these are Chinese words
and this is the track pad for the track pad
I think is a good choice
all the basic finger gestures like pinch to zoom pan
screw-ups cool down
so here we can customize the pressure sensitivity of the pan
you can choose the dowel here on the right side here
just dial it up or down
the default value is fine
and this is where you can customize the two side buttons
this is how you can map the working area of the tablet to your screen
you will not go to the right side this is other
V Photoshop cs5 on the Mac
this isn't very smooth
very nice pressure sensitivity works really well
the transition between a thin and thick lines is very soon suddenly
I cannot be any of you
NT it was quite bad
but now it's actually very usable
this is ought to be illustrator
cs5 pressure works very well
this is MIDI Bank pinch
Pro pressure works here very well
there is no lack here
strokes tapers smoothly and secure strokes
it doesn't work with me
Bank so that's one glitch that I found this
is this cheat pressure books here as well this is
so that's the problem here
it's the same problem with MIDI Bank pain to prove
this is taya sweet catches pearl
it works quite well
you can use the trackpad to zoom in and zoom out so it tracking here
and now let's do a quick pro's and con's recap so the major
Pro for me about this tablet would be the boot quality disk use first solid
it feels quite premium because of the metal back and smooth finishing right at the front and back
the drawing functionality is very good to the strokes taper very smoothly circular spiral strokes
they asked move as well not angular and this applies to
Windows as well
so this is a very good tablet forward drawing purposes the downside is when you draw very heavily
and you lift up your pen suddenly there
it now works quite well although with some software it's dude doesn't work for example earlier
I show you that you can pinch to zoom with photoshop
illustrator is three sketches
Pro quite well they work well but with MIDI Bank pinch
I think we need a pinch to zoom in
I think it's a good choice
I really like to use keyboard shortcuts
the physical shortcut buttons here
they are 9s they have a nice tactile feel to them and it worked
I prefer to turn off the functionality of the trackpad for me
this tablet is battery-powered
you're charging the tablet so that's quite real anyway
that's the end of today's review
thanks for watching
I hope this video is helpful
see you in the next video bye you
hi this is
Brad Linder with will repeating and this is an asus memo pad 8
it's got the same intel atom z3580 fastest chip on the market
but it's going to be good enough to give you a pretty good performance
tablet sells for about $1.99 makes it a little bit cheaper than a full price
Google Nexus 7 2013 edition or Amazon Kindle Fire HDX and in terms of benchmarks
it actually fares pretty well against those devices or at least the Nexus 7 which
I've had a chance to test even though this has less RAM than the Nexus 7
it's got android 4.4
let's take a quick look around here
we've got stereo speakers which are on the back here
and they're only on one sides if you're holding it in landscape mode
jack microphone and micro
USB ports a little bit on that that's on the top but through the management of screen
rotation you could make this the topic you really wanted to
but it's it doesn't really feel like it gets in the way too much and like
I said there's a couple of nice touches there
there's also a few custom asus
let's go ahead and open up a few applications here you can see it does come with
Google Play Store and while early tablets with Intel Atom processor is
I feel like didn't do a great job of running every Android app
that was available
I haven't really found anything that you can't run on this guy so I find chrome here
we've got support for pinch-to-zoom webpages load reasonably quickly
when you're not having issues connecting to the internet or something yep
Internet issues here
we go and in terms of video
I've had no problems with Netflix or YouTube
viewing angles are pretty good
so it doesn't really matter how you're holding the tablet
you should be able to see don't know
I'm having internet issues
it's not dual-band
let's go ahead and fire up a quick game here now with a 1280 by 800 pixel display
some people might lament that it doesn't have a full
HD screen held a reasonable distance from your face
you're probably not going to see a huge difference
between this and a tablet with a 1280
we ran a 1920 by 1080 screen
you don't hear anything coming out of this side speakers reasonably loud so overall
that might be even more appealing
I like where Asus is going and I like where
you're probably not going to notice much especially now that
Android KitKat really
lets you run full-screen immersive applications
I think that's the way it should be one thing
I think I forgot to show here is
let's go ahead and there is a custom keyboard application here
there's some things to like about it
there's a lot to like for $1.99 budget
hey guys so today
I'm gonna be reviewing the like s 640 m tablet that was sent to me for review
alright so let's start so it's quite small
let's see the box is really nice
alright so the tablet is quite tiny but could be perfect for outdoor use like outdoor painting
and then some studies on a laptop or even like someone who was a beginner
that seems like something nice to start with
price is about twenty-five twenty-five dollars
it feels pretty sturdy
it's thin you can see but it doesn't
Bend it's nice
it was really nice
yeah that's about three four feet
we have the pan
nice nice holding for the pan
what's really nice about the depen
I've seen they all need a battery battery free pen
all right okay
we got nice and this is not an actual CD
this is a driver
download all right so one of the things
I noticed right off
the bat is there is no left or right it's a left-handed and right-handed suitable
you can switch it either way you want doesn't matter it still looks the same which is really nice
I found it quite nice
I'm right-handed myself
nothing's unusual just not gonna make sure that you unplug your other tablet if you have one
it is quite impressive for such a little tablet as this and it it works nice
you can do anything light
I simple when I paint in Photoshop
I sample with alt and I switch between the colours with X
I always had that this way so this is really great so far
you know it's quite impressive
you have of course the mapping you can map it in my case
I have two two monitors
that's what you see here right now
it's on all so
I like to click press very likely when I press someone that was with my friends
my and/or the mapping because there's such little space but if
I use both monitors all right
so let's see how it does in clip studio
it feels good
it feels just like a regular tablet
it's very small something you would take on the road probably from what
I understand you can also play games with games
that require a tablet
that is so definitely a nice little tablet very versatile
very lightweight doesn't take much space perfect for beginners or outdoors traveling
I would definitely keep it as a backup
it works really well
the pen feels really nice and big closet
it needs no battery no charging whatsoever
hey guys it's me
ren and welcome to another tablet review
in today's video
it's the vague vk1200
let's just jump right into it as you all know
i've been using vague tablets until this day
all are the other necessary accessories as you can see here
i was quite surprised to see two pens
both stored in their pen pouches
the fact that they had to provide two pens is amazing
it has a very nice feel to it
we have here the greeting card a cleaning cloth to help
clean your screen as you should here
we have the cables to connect the tablet to your computer
which is the hdmi cable
and ac type usb cable the quick start guide which i really need to use later on
eventually and here we have so many extra nibs and a key nib remover
i swear they provide so many nibs which is insane
i don't even replace my nibs often
we got here a pen holder but with more nibs to store in it like this is already a lot of nibs
but i ain't complaining though
this pen holder also serves as a storage for your nibs and can go as your nib
remover onwards to the tablet
it's a 11 by 6 inch display tablet
here are the two ports where you'll connect the provided cables from your tablet to your computer
i love the design and its thickness overall
so these are the contents
you'll get when you purchase this product
the colors are way different from my laptop which is good
the screen has an anti-glare design which also can protect your eyes
i'll link it in the description down below
i'm just kidding
hey jojo reference here
i'm comparing its size to my ipad which is 11.2 inches
let's move on to the driver
what i like about bix driver is that it's not separated per model
it's just one driver installation and no matter
what big tablet you plug in it will detect which model you're using instantly
you can download the driver on their website at big.com and just install the driver
i always provide a speed paint process so in today's occasion
i'll be finishing my paintings
which is ya boi kaiman from doro hedora
if you haven't watched doro hedorah i highly recommend it and also the manga is really good
i like that
they provided an extra pen
the fact that it only has two cables needed was beyond my relief
i also did a fingerprint test and it doesn't leave any behind
the surface of the tablet was like it was giving me the feel of like drawing on paper
it was very matte
i suppose it was
it's really smooth
it's not one of those like screens
that is very slippery and stuff like that it
it gave me the feel that i was like literally drawing on paper
now i'll be listing down some concerns
i don't know the cable ports could have been designed to be in the left side of the tablet
would i recommend this tablet
well you can take it on the go which is very convenient
and of course it's battery free so no need to charge the pen
i love the product definitely recommend to any beginner artist
and it's very affordable too if you're looking for a cheap display tablet who knows
you can ask your relatives as a christmas gift
what made you start doing digital art
or what inspired you to do digital art
big vk1200 display tablet
well i bid you guys good luck and stay safe everyone bye you
you has made some very nice touches with this particular tablet however
I need to treat one thing first
that is the charging cords that it comes with
I recommend doing it that way
this is why I actually could not really get a nice good secure fit with the pin charger
I'll go ahead and unplug this
a silicon casing is
I love this casing
it just doesn't quite sit in as it should
I don't want to fit into certain cases
this is open enough to come any and it does come with a micro
you just take the casing off
put it in there and then you can cover it up which is like
I said actually a nice thing because it prevents accidents accidental popping out
the cutout on this is superlative
I own quite a few silicone cases
if there's button
how well do they respond
you hear that
click they respond excellently superlatively so nicely done
plastic stand now
that's it really
it's some it's plastic
you notice how it's grayed out that's inherent to all IPS displays now
whoa look at that
displays have that phasing
but they're not all equally as dramatic as that once you get into about the $130 and you still get
I know I do
it is good and clear
I just have the kids at Kids Place which is a very safe environment
you get your general games
because this is huge as you can see
it has eight gigs left with
I'm sorry 7 gigs
I'll go into my written review
exactly what that means
so that's a huge selling point in my eyes and of course
Bluetooth capable once again
it was pretty rare to actually have these budget
tablets have bluetooth support
this does in fact
I have those contextual
kids headphones paired up with it
so you just go to settings go into bluetooth
it's already paired and all you do
is you simply leave on your Bluetooth
they're automatically repair
so it's a one thing
these particular headphones are actually
they're either you know market for kids but they act
I have had value in kid
adjustment this actually
although very well fit on a child does have a enormous amount of flexibility
and boy can they get loud
you just turned that button on that button is only for the FM transmitter
you're going to want to look at the instructions
I did which is really unusual for someone like me
who's you know gone through hundreds of headphones
but that's for the FM transmitter
I'm really surprised
how much functions
it's just nicely done its depth out of the
this is the third pair of kids headphones
I've evaluated and this is definitely without a doubt
I mean these are some upgraded kids headphones
these are definitely not what you expect with the kids headphones
I would expect really high thin anemic middle range and like no bass at all
this is actually a nice
it's emphasized ties but with some bass punch to it
it's good pair of headphones so between the two
I have to applaud context here
oh one last thing it comes also with a net mat mesh net bag so yeah
a lot of great touches with context shows kids tablets and headphones
a lot of forethought went into this
you guys have yourself a great one
yes yes oh
so this is the vankyo matrix z1 tablet
now this is a very low end tablet it features android
this tablet does enable you to install disney the disney app as well as netflix prime
maybe your 40 quid 50 quid
it would have been a better price point
i think for this but overall it's a very cheap tablet
there's really not much to say about it
basically apart from the ips display
it's got good viewing angles and overall not a bad
you know viewing experience for this sort of price point at least so overall yeah
it's it's not all right
tablet does its job but nothing special you
hey everyone this is teal from
Park Blocks calm in today's video
I'm going to review there's tablet
this is the sim bans
Picasso tap this is a ten inch
Android drawing tablet that was sent to me recently by the company sim bents
so the highlight of this tablet
I was told is that it supports pressure sensitivity and part rejection with included stallers
so that got me interested to review this tablet but before
I start the review
let's check out the things that are included in the Box
this is the packaging box other than the name of the tablet and a company's name
there is not much printed on it not even the specifications
so let's take a look inside
the tablet is prized at us $200 and it includes this carrying case
we'll take a closer look later on
there is a manual
we have a warranty card
the tablet has a one-year warranty and here in this small box
we have the power cables and pulp locks
that's this little battery for the stylists
that's included this is the USB charging cable that's included
this will go to the wall charger and this site here this
it's very convenient very easy with this
it's imitation leather
it doesn't make that have let go to sleep
this material is quite smooth and there are
is this elastic holder
here this is for holding the pen that is included for the price of the tablet
this stylus pen is also included and the build quality of this pen is excellent
we have this little clip
here there is no eraser at the back of the pen
I'm not sure about the battery life but it's supposed to last quite long
I haven't used the pen enough to drain out all the battery
I do not see any replacement tips included so
I'm not sure where you can buy replacement tips when this one wears out anyway
I'm going to ask the company and update information in my text review for us 200 dollars
you get this pen you get the case you get tablet
I think that's a good price
I actually do not expect a lot from a tablet
there's price range especially when they included all the freebies as you can see
this screen is quite reflective
the screen protector is already pasted onto the screen and this is how reflective it is
this is a 10-inch screen on the front
we have a camera on the back
we have another camera as well
we have the logo on the back
this is a nice matte surface but of course when you put it in the case this does not matter now
this tablet is a bit thick
and it's a bit heavy a bit thicker or behaviour compared to other
Android tablets that I have used before on this side
we have some buttons and pots the power buttons here
the volume buttons are here
they are quite close together so sometimes when I'm pressing the power button
I mean accidentally press the volume button speaker on this side
there's another speaker on the other side
this is the type
C connection pot
you can use this for charging you can also use these to transfer files to your computer
this is a micro
though this is the 3.5 mm audio jack
a small microphone port and this is the micro SD card slot
so if you want to add more storage to your tablet you can do so the speaker on this tablet
it's not very good
it feels too echoey
I'm going to do a search on my review so let's type in sim bans
I can also sort of show you how fast the Internet is loading
so it's actually quite responsive
so let's take a look at the specifications of this tablet so we have a gyroscope
this tablet will auto rotate so these are the specifications
the screen is 10.1 inch aspect ratio 16 by 9 this is an IPS screen so color
reproduction is actually quite good
the viewing angles are quite good as well
the resolution is 1280 by 800
this is not a very high resolution screen for a 10-inch screen like this
I would have preferred 108 opie resolution
the storage is 32
you get we have cameras we have
those are the google apps and also the drawing app which is a sketchbook pro sketch
it doesn't allow you to upgrade the Android OS so you have to stick with version 7.0
all the way as we have any
Android OS tablet or smartphones
you can customize a lot of things about the OS so I installed Nova Launcher
that's why my desktop looks like this
I'm going to use sketchbook since
that's the recommended app for use with this stylus
let me show you some strokes on sketchbook app first so
I'm going to draw some slow diagonal lines now at the camera and go that I'm pointing at
this is something that you have to get used to so these are slow
diagonal lines that
I was actually resting my palm
wahwah drawing this lines and I had some stray strokes here so palm rejection
it doesn't work that well earlier on
I mentioned that this is an active stylus so it supports pressure sensitivity and palm rejection
if you want palm rejection to work flawlessly the pen tip has to be really close to the screen
I put down the department
and that's that strange stroke
I'm going to put that tablet in the case
I can actually raise my palm on this surface which is higher compared to the screen
so this sort of prevents those straight strokes from happening enough of the testing
so let's try and draw a quick sketch using this pen and have it
you can use finger gestures if you draw at this speed that
I'm drawing it now
the diagonal line
Jeter it's not really that big of problem
I'm lifting my palm away from the screen because I'm going to prevent the straight strokes
I can raise my palm on this side here drawing performance
it's quite responsive so when
I'm drawing at normal speed
I do not have a lot of jitter
here's another sketch that I drew earlier with sketchbook
let me just scroll slowly to let you see the lines
so pressure works but there is jitter when you are drawing very slowly and at the normal speed
I usually draw
this are how the lines will look like
sometimes there are jitter but sometimes there aren't any so for lines like this
there are some slight cheater but overall still looks quite smooth
you see all these dots here
those are straight strokes because of the palm rejection so that was the sketchbook app and now
I'm using art flow
let's try and draw something again now
for some reason the strokes in up flow they are a bit smoother
compared to sketchbook pressure sensitivity is supported here as well but again palm rejection
it doesn't work too well but I'm glad that the strokes here
sometimes it depends on the app that you use there is still some slack
oh let's do a quick sketch again because palm rejection doesn't work very well
I'm going to raise my palm on the case here
hot flow is definitely a nicer app
to draw with compared to sketchbook
I really like this app
let's try and sheet this
let's create some dots here
what though definitely feels much smoother compared to sketchbook and
I really like drawing with this app
sometimes there is still a bit of
Jeeter but it's very minimal
so if you look at this sketch that i drew at normal speed
I think it's a bit difficult for me
to find a jitter
the lines overall they are quite smooth
let me show you a sketch that
I drew a few days ago outdoors while I was with my friends at a cafe so this was drawn on location
they are quite smooth
sometimes there are jitter but not really a big deal so check out this lines here
they are pretty smooth
you're as well
this is quite smooth
this is quite responsive you can definitely take notes with this dollars
the handwriting is
I think captured quite accurately although not at 100% accuracy but for Android tablets
I think this performance is quite good
well I was writing this
I was resting my palm here and there is one straight stroke here which is not too bad
I was expecting a lot more the last app I want to try out is MIDI Bank paint Pro on Android
there is slight lack but not for a big problem
so let me draw those slow diagonal lines again
there is slight cheater but not too bad compared to other apps
this is normal drawing speed
I think it looks fine
Autodesk SketchBook it works fine but I prefer to use odd flow which is really great
it works wonderfully some of this apps
they are free some are paid so
I recommend app
flew the battery
life for this tablet is actually quite good
I can get around 8 to 10 hours on a hundred percent charge
it's quite good now
this is at its brightest in fact let me just
I'll show you how dim it can be
the responsiveness is quite decent
you can use it to watch youtube videos but the song isn't that great
you can surf the web panning and zooming
it's quite responsive
I actually kind of like the price point at us $200 we have a very good pan
we have the case
we have the tablet
so that's a good price point for those
we've limited budget for students for beginners who want to try our digital sketching
the battery life is great
I am more than satisfied when drawing with this pen and tablet the 10.1
inch screen is a good size to draw on color
reproduction is quite good
the resolution is a bit low for this 10-inch screen if it has a 100
P resolution screen
I think this would be perfect
that's the only thing
Jeeter but some apps they are they perform better so again
I have to stress
that drawing performance really comes down to the app that you use from the Google Play Store
Android is the Samsung tablets
and those are much more expensive
Android tablet for drawing
the drawing performance is as you have seen
let me know what you think about
this tablet are interested to get one
do you think it's good enough for digital sketching
I hope this video is helpful
thanks for watching
see you in the next video bye
hello everyone it's Apple mint and welcome back again to my channel as always
I post a new video every Friday
so if you're into art videos please consider subscribing so for today's video
I received this tablet a few weeks ago from huion
thank you so much for sending me this
that's a mouthful
I know but this tablet is totally amazing
this thing is absolutely huge
I can't really fit the whole thing in camera but I'm doing it the best I can as always
Julian always includes these little thank-you cards so this is the best part
and are you know
they're meant to sit on the desk and not be mood whereas this one is thin
so this is the tablet stand so it opens up like this actually
you don't have to worry about having this gigantic stand with you
you can just slip this into your backpack with your tablet and you're good
so yeah these these are really they really come in handy
and it's nice that they included it with this tablet so this is the pen case
ok let's do that properly
this is the pen case and the pen is actually a lot nicer right
I have one of these
I want to point out about this tablet is that it has the command keys on the side
these are so so useful so uh yeah
so this tablet if you buy it off
Amazon which I will provide the link below
or you can purchase this it is 483 dollars and let me tell you
that's at that
might sound like a big amount
their tablets tend to be super super expensive
they're like the Apple iPhone of the tablet market
they are really expensive and their quality is really good
don't get me wrong
I say almost exactly is good that you can get for a fraction of the price
it is a really good tablet for what you pay for
it is amazing so you know this is honestly my new
go-to tablet every other tablet
I've used I had a Wacom Bamboo
sorry was it no
it was a Wacom
Intuos Pro medium-size
this is my my favorite screen tablet
I've ever tried out
I love health than it is at the price
point is great and for the specs
it's got a 8,192 levels of pen pressure sensitivity which is one of the highest if not the highest
it's their bigger tablet
model that run into the thousands
so this tablet is pretty big
it's it ten point six inches screen which is a large screen for almost around $500
because if you're looking at a Wacom Cintiq which is 13 inches
it's about like $1000 so already right there
you know
I think in this price range you should
it should have it and this one luckily does so
that's another plus and just the overall portability of this tablet is really nice
you know you can take it anywhere
I I'm gonna say it's not you know it's not perfect you know
I was touching on the screen
I'm not really feeling at a loss here so I would definitely recommend this tablet
I would definitely definitely say to take a look at this tablet
I'd say this is totally worth it
I've always wanted a nice tablet screen tablet and I just kind of love
let us know what you think so
this is my honest opinion
I'm really in love with this tablet and I'm so so happy and grateful again
thank you for sending it to me so
there's a link in my description on exactly where you can get this tablet
so if you're interested please check that out also in my description as always are the links to my
Instagram Twitter
I hope you guys have a beautiful day and I will see you in my next video bye bye you
hello everybody and today
i'm going to be reviewing the gammon m10k 2018 drawing tablet
let's just start so obviously you can see me pointing out all of the shiny stuff obviously
let's read the back of it
i don't know why it just took me so long to flip over a box
but here's all of the wording
i guess so at first what i see are the requirements all this stuff and then what it contains now
i'm going to flip it over again and let's see what's in the box
this has already been cut open
oh it's it's big
i didn't is it that big
oh my oh my gosh
that's so huge
all right so it is the size
it's really nice as you cannot see in that angle
there we go
it has a bunch of side t's ten actually and then the middle button so basically eleven
oh another well
this is the first badge or is it
i don't yeah it is wait
no beach has a tablet
what the oh
it's a taste
um i don't know why i didn't think that it was a case
it obviously is fits on the tablet nicely
let's just see if it fits in there
oh all right
so those are the nibs and that silver thin tape them out
i really like the felt pouch
oh i see a pen
go for the pen
yay i went for the pen
oh it's really nice so it has two buttons
that's not the right way you put it in but okay
oh and there's a glove
i thought that was only with the pro version
but that's really nice of jam on to include that
it's a bag inside a bag
all right
i'm gonna open the bag inside the bag
um if i can yay there we go
thank you from damn on that
everybody does then the warranty card then how to download the driver all right
don't throw it out yet foreign so do so so do so foreign so bye balls family
uh now for the pros and cons
the pros are that it's smooth and i really like all of it
the only con i have is that there was a strain recorder
good there you are my name is Alex and welcome to a new review
I'm not sure how useful this could be
I guess you could use this as a mini PC
we have the Intel Zee 8350 CPU
this is a quad-core CPU
we also have four gigs of RAM 64 gigs of internal storage dual band
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
this tablet or mini
PC it's running Windows 10
the box is the brand name and the model name inside the box
those metallic legs can be used as a stand
the device itself so even though this is not that big
it's not as comfortable to hold so for example
anything over 8 inch tablet
it's nice cute
then you can basically hold it in your pocket if you want
well that's another case so this because this is quite thick unlike the previous model the goalie
1 F 1 if I remember correctly this one is actually made out of plastic
it's on the back on the right hand side we have a 3.5 made audio jack
you're going to find the holes for the speaker and
I do believe that this has only one speaker
I haven't actually opened it to check it out but it sounds like has only one speaker
the speaker doesn't seem to get that loud either
so if you're in a noisy environment you're not gonna hear what's happening on the tablet
and lastly on the back we have the port for the power adapter
it's also important
so we have an 8 inch screen the resolution of 1280 by 800 so just over 720p
now the battery life will depend from user to user
I was browsing a little so a bit of everything but it really depends from user to user
and how you use your tablet connectivity wise
we have dual band
I'm going to start recording the screen
we'll do a couple of benchmark tests
alright so first of all these loops just like any other mini
PC that runs Windows 10 one thing
I notice that I didn't like that much was the screen resolution
so even though
I have this set up like this at this time and then I tried it on having just one display
not the display on the tablet
so even like that
the maximum resolution and shoes
Windows 10 as I said before and this used to be an activated the copy of a Windows 10
I didn't do a whole bunch of updates yesterday
we have four gigs of ram
I also wanted to show you the task manager here
we can see the CPU
this is the RAM so we have available two point two gigs of ram
at this time this is the harddrive yes so we have a Samsung Quran
it is being there somewhere
run all the scores
that we've seen on our other mini pcs with the exact same configuration
so now if we click on home here you can basically see all the components out of the mini
this can probably tell it doesn't totally go the more like moving around so move back
this is the hard drive so we have some type of a Samsung storage
and we have 50 gigs
this is a resolution of 720p
and you can probably tell it stops it goes again it stops
it goes against all not a better experience for watching YouTube videos
I'm not sure where this is happening
but yet only among the words that
I've seen for any mini PC that I throw when I try to make this full screen
just you have a better idea how code use the form for live strings
so let's keep on this again and we'll just wait a second
it's in slow motion
let's pick on the first one here
this is the file
yeah not like great so
I'm gonna skip forward a bit as I said if you don't move the mouse and you don't touch anything
it seems to go okay but as soon as you touch anything next thing kind of stops so for example so
I'm not even sure if we should try the other file
look if it's going to be the same all done all of them
oh let's just go on a 4k file out of curiosity and see what happens so we have a 4k file
60 frames per second
let's try this on just out of curiosity turn again
we wait and go
I'm seeing it's a black screen
oh look at that
I'm duplicating the screen
there is no point in trying other ones
because you've seen there girl needs slow motion so long
stop call the and next
I wanna play a game for a couple of minutes
just have an idea
how gaming would do on this okay so
I'm using the keyboard and mouse
it's not totally horrible
but not the absolute best either so as I said not the absolute worst but not the best either
so let's keep going
I'm not sure why
that's amazing maybe this will be fixed with some more future software updates but at this time
it's definitely not the best all right
I totally enjoyed this video if you did like it press that like button
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you in the next one
thanks for watching
sup guys welcome back to world tunes
i recently got a brand new drawing tablet from xp pen and i'm here to review it
the drawing tablet i've had for the longest
is this one also from xp pen
satisfying shot and with the drawing tablet comes a little drawing glove
the other cap serves as a pen stand
so when you're not using it you can just put it in there to rest it on the table
it's really helpful
the left side of the tablet has eight customizable shortcut keys
that you can program to do whatever you want in your drawing software and in the middle
there's a little red dial that you can either use to scroll or zoom
i hope you enjoyed my little review of it now
i'm gonna do a speed paint
enjoy watch out
watch out watch out
I used the translator :,,) I HAVE A TABLEEEEET!
Sorry, I'm still excited ...
I've never done this type of video, so I don't know how to start ok
So ... I'll show you what it brings, I guess first
the first thing we see is the huge tablet, I can't believe it
It has ten shotcut buttons, man, TEN, WHAT TABLET GIVES YOU TEN BUTTONS
?! don't respond.
Bring a pencil with its own
beautiful felt case, does not use batteries and does not have to be recharged
that is very good, because it is somewhat annoying, the pencil also has two configurable
buttons brings a glove so that when drawing you do not scratch the screen with your hand
let's try it!
oh! gaomon also gives you a one year warranty in case you have a problem with a product
This is the first country that I draw with the tablet, believe it or not ... ready!
Look at her, how beautiful (inclusive language, Hispanic thing, info. in desc) also later,
I will animate a little bit
because that's what amazed me the most when...
it's realistic hair!
:O it's for cheating
haha: ^) (drawing:
ok, class, let's see how well you draw hair)
nope, it didn't die, it's only in ... (how to make an interesting protagonist?
plz) ... pause :,,)
the meme is a backstory, but not a character, it is a fact
I hope I can show if I do the pilot ...
I don't know if I will either don't kill me ;-; this story has to do with my animation
meme of "soldier, poet, king" so ...
I don't know, make theories, I don't know, you are for that >:^
ok, you saw how everything works, it is beautiful <3 now
I mean The one they sent me doesn't cost more than 65 USD with the discount
that's less than half of what it costs about 10 seconds of wefere
(Hispanic thing x2) make your investments u u
so, if to buy any of these beautiful tablets at a great price, links in the description
it were so beautiful that I didn't want to be the only one to see them
I wanted you all to see it too
I will also leave the links to their social media in case you want to give them some luv bye <3
hey this is
the design is really nice in hand
I actually really do like the the silver finish which has replaced the black edges on the color
it's actually different from the color in two ways
and since it's now a tablet it has a dual-core
you'll be spending most of your time touching the beautiful 7 inch
IPS display
but there are some things
I really like about it
Barnes & Noble does have a good ecosystem of newspapers and magazines in its newsstand app
they don't have a great ecosystem when it comes to movies and videos and music unlike
Amazon they don't have a place to buy music on the device
Plus to stream video
the app selection also
isn't that great
hi everyone and welcome back in today's video
I'll be doing a review and demonstration of the Galman pv 1 161 pen display
this is a graphic tablet in a compact size that you can plug into your laptop or computer
so you can have a screen to draw on and a pressure-sensitive pen before we dive in
this is the second
I'm going to start by unboxing
the tablet taking a look at what comes in the box
then setup the tablet test out the pen and create a finished artwork in Photoshop
I've worked on ok
so the tablet comes really well packaged in a sturdy box
everything is well protected and set into a molded packaging insert
the first thing in the box is the tablet
it's a 11.6 inch tablet with a 256 point thirty two millimeter by 144 point 18
millimeter working area
it has an IPS screen with a 1920
by 1080 resolution there are 8 customisable
Express keys down one side and then power menu and adjustment buttons along the edge
there is a full list of specs over on the Galman website
I've kept the tablet in its packaging bag just to lessen the glare on camera along with the tablet
there is the pen that now
when you're working can really help your hand to glide more easily across the screen so
I'm always pleased to see these gloves
it's just one that you can draw on
I liked here that the cables were all connected as it keeps everything tidier
issues they have all the drivers for their products available for both
Windows and Mac downloading
the driver took less than a minute and so did the installation once installed
I could fiddle and adjust any of the settings to the tablet
I was ready to start drawing for the drawing portion of this video
I'm starting out drawing lines and swirls varying the amount of pressure
I'm using going from light to hard to see the difference in the lines as you can see
I've used these practice pages
I find a really useful when you're starting with a drawing tablet as you can practice
how much pressure to apply to get the line that you want
the pen itself is actually a bit shorter and slimmer than the other
Gangwon pen I'm used to working with
it was also a little lighter as well
Galvan Pen and some of the other drawing tablets
I've reviewed in the past is the lack of battery or charging cable
I don't know if it is rubber
I have had more issues with lag when I was working on an older computer
but that was the computers issue and not the tablets one thing
I did find however was that the tablet heated up as I was working
now this is the same as my other
it's a small tablet the working area of the screen
it's actually just a little bit less than this
and that's not something
I normally do as my other tablet is much heavier and thicker
I found that whenever I do have a glitch with the pen on these sorts of tablets
it's also important that you have the updated driver software as well one thing
I want to mention here is that the tablet doesn't come with a stand
this again is going to be entirely personal preference
some of you may prefer working completely flat
on your tablet
I enjoyed working on this tablet
it's another great product from Galman
there were some design differences in the pen which I really liked and using a smaller tablet
I hope that this video was helpful if you were looking for information on this tablet
Galman is currently having a big sale
thank you again to
Galman for sending me along this new model to have a look at
thank you all for watching and have a creative day you
hi everyone mahmoud is here
today i'm going to review my first ever powerblock graphics tablet
this is probably nino's medium-sized graphics
and let's get started
but you look at this tablet guys
the first thing you will notice is design
it has a very unique design guys
i think it's called the hook design
and this part you see extends from the right top corner
let's start um let's start with a quick unboxing first
this is the tablet box pretty colorful
i like it
they all are pretty similar to wacom intuos graphics templates
this is a stylus
it looks like a good quality battery free stylus
it doesn't have a rubber grip but it looks comfortable
i like the usb cable
it is usb type-c my favorite and also it looks super sturdy
i like it
and there are two usb adapters for the android mode one type
c and one micro usb adapter
these are the extra nibs and the classic nip remover and we have manuals that's it
let's start testing as soon as you plug it
okay first of all guys i like the top of the surface um it is really good and i also like the pen
the pen is not heavy enough
it would be great if it was heavier
but it's not bad
the tablet and the pen shows a really good performance
now let's check the tablet pen software
at least for mac right
i believe you will find it
setup is it's a zip file um you need to download it first then install it
it's a very cool looking software
um yep everything works great
now it is time to test the android mode
the good thing is the cursor is visible
i know there might be shorter problems in samsung phones
and i will record a video about that with the solution
your phone needs to be in the portrait mode guys
it's good and finally i will change the nib and yes
this is what you need to do
okay okay
this is um pablo nino's medium-sized graphics
tablet it's about 50 on amazon
yeah it's a good price for a medium-sized graphics
tablet and you can check the current prices amazon affiliate links are in the description below
it could be heavier but it's good
it does the job uh by the way guys
pablo nino's m has different colors
that's it for today
if you have any questions please comment below and let me know
i'll be with you in another video about online teaching
keep watching mathematics goodbye
I was on fire Kindle and it was this one here and I truly did not like it
at all
it was heavy it was bulky
I was on have come back with the Amazon fire
which although maybe not full HD it still manages to provide a 1024 by 600 resolution
its internal storage comes in two sizes ranging from 8 gigabytes to 16 gigabytes
however you can't just increase the internal storage yourself
by inserting a micro SD card up to a maximum of 256 gigabytes
Wi-Fi connectivity and of course one of the best things about the new Amazon fire 7 tablets
is that it already comes pre-installed with Amazon's personal assistance Alexa
how good is this tablets to actually use now
Amazon's operating system
but to be honest that is pretty much exactly the same as most operating systems out there have
itself don't get me wrong however this is not a major problem and in terms of general use
I found it to be fairly pleasant
the camera for sleep does let it down and should really only be used
Smash Hits Super
if you are one of them people who must watch something in the true HD 1080p formats
the screen itself does look fairly crisp however it easily and I do mean easily
it is in fact just a simple tablet
it provides a fairly decent performance
it can run games and of course allow you to watch movies and YouTube on the go
you've nothing to maybe worry about
if anything should go wrong with it or in case you lose it so what
I personally recommend the Amazon fire
seven well to be honest
that's entirely on what you need it for
I would highly recommend this
it may not be the best in quality up there but in regards to its price
hello everyone and welcome to the second installment of the seer
a 'but reviews trademark symbol
today i will be reviewing a graphic drawing tablet specifically the goemon
i still don't know how to pronounce it pd
1 5 6 0
i hope you all find this review interesting enlightening and it changes your life for the better
like last time i will be straying off the beaten path of typical unboxing / review videos
i will review the tablet and then unbox it
screw your conventional review video methods
we do things different around here
i'll start things off with some basic facts about the tablet
it has a very nicely sized 15.6 inch display
that's larger than most phone screens
there are also 5 buttons on the side
one is a power button
the other four are used to adjust the display settings of the tablet
now let's go over how to set this thing up
the first thing to do is assemble the stand
it's pretty simple
on the back of the tablet
there are four screw holes on the stand
there are four screw holes
you will be given four screws
there are even pictures to show you how to do it
then you use the provided
screw driver to screw the screws in
I think this is the first product I've ever received
where a Phillips head screwdriver was provided I loved it
it saved me all the time
it would have taken to find my own
it was great
you then pull this latch on the back to adjust the stand up and down
it's pretty simple
the next thing to do is get it connected to your computer
this may all be slightly confusing
so here's the diagram provide in the user manual now that you have your tablet set up
it's time to download the driver which you can find on the goemon website
once you've done this open it up and you'll find many different useful functions in the
About tab you can
export tablet configurations and import ones
you've already made before in the work area
lastly there are the press keys aka shortcuts which
I am so very fond of in drawing tablets
there are 10 shortcuts which you can format using the fairly intuitive button
mapping system now that that's all covered
I don't like it when tablets are smooth or slippery
I've never used a drawing tablet before that has this kind of resistance and it's very nice
in my opinion the pressure sensitivity worked fine and the shortcuts also worked well
there isn't much else to say about it except it draw good now
please enjoy this footage of me drawing some stuff on the tablet
I hope you all enjoyed that
I sure did now under the second portion of any review / unboxing video the unboxing
the dog was useless in opening the box so I enlisted the help of my female assistant
there were no scissors on hand so
I gave her a small spoon to use
she made surprisingly quick work of the box
despite the excess use of packaging tape that had been applied to it
I was disappointed
it wasn't more entertaining inside
the first box was another box
the items it contained were a note from
I had immediately mistaken it
for one of those screen covers that are super satisfying to peel off
and yeah what it's supposed to be is a textured screen
protector that simulates drawing on paper
alrighty let's move on to some final thoughts
I don't like the software that goemon has made for
its tablets
this isn't a complaint about the tablet itself
but if you get the tablet you'll have to deal with the software
I do because you can't set different shortcut inputs for specific software
second isn't really a complaint
like you'll whip it out at the airport while you're waiting for your plane to arrive or something
connect the tablet to a power source and connect the tablet to your computer
and if you want to use the stand you've got to put in four screws
it's not a bad thing that this tablet isn't portable or convenient
it's just that it shouldn't be marketed that way
lastly is that it feels kind of cheap
the screen is plastic
the buttons are plastic and they wiggle
I'm not saying it isn't a reliable tablet or that it doesn't function well
the display looks very nice
protector works very well
I wish other tablet companies would include things like that
most importantly about the tablet is that it's functional and reliable
I can't express how much I like the slight amount of resistance between the pen and screen
there are plenty of shortcut keys the larger screen size at least compared to the tablet
I usually use is very refreshing
it comes with its own screwdriver
lastly and very importantly it is relatively cheap
I hope you found this review helpful and anyway thanks bye
as promised here's my review of the wacom cintiq 16.
i bought this tablet with my own money and wacom did not supply the tablet to me
now let's get started so for the pen
the pen buttons started to feel quite loose
you have to keep pressing it until it does
each a pro of the pen is that
it's really nice to erase things
and i like how the eraser is as pen pressure to it
the screen is really nice and fingerprints or hand
prints don't really show up which is good
the screen also feels really natural to draw on
it's smooth but not too smooth where your pen is struggling with how slippery the screen is
but that's just musing like i said earlier
the screen does sometimes show imprints of my drawings and they are easily wiped off
i'm not really a fan of the whole pen sleeve thing
it doesn't feel intuitive or natural to me it's just not ergonomic at all
i have with the cintiq 16.
all of them are rather minor though
i would have to restart the driver
it's quite rare but when it does happen it's very annoying
there are some miscellaneous pros
look up references or even to watch shows whilst i draw well
if i'm not drawing i can have both monitors on especially when i'm playing d
the express menu isn't very intuitive
which is roughly around 120
i tried using the keyboard at first a lot of my keyboard shortcuts
i use a two-handed i found this rather finicky
use both hands for the keyboard shortcut
then come back and yes i could have changed the shortcuts but i liked the shortcuts
how they were
i didn't want to change them so what i did
instead was i got a numpad i messed around with this
software called hidden macros but the software didn't work at all
everything i set to
ac 19 will come out soon
so is it worth it
the answer to that is a big
thanks for watching
they're both at gleamie arts
see you in the next video bye
hey there today i just wanted to give a little bit of insight on how i make my animatics
i use fire alpaca and imovie fire
alpaca is completely free drawing program
you can have on mac or on windows or just on on linux as well as just like anything
so let's go in right
this can be really useful to make sure the frames are consistent and moving at the right pace
ken burns off
because otherwise you'll have it moving
you know the camera will be moving in each frame separately
and it'll just look awful so here i just bring them in
it takes a few minutes
i made this using a tablet from gaomon now
this video isn't sponsored but the people at gammon very kindly sent me this you can see online
they have this seven day offer on at the moment
um it looks really nice
it's got some good hot keys that you can
it's very simple just with the driver you can
you can put them to wherever you want
so i put them to like ctrl c ctrl v ctrl z
and so on um also the pen has quite a nice grip
you're not going to do that because you have this really neat glove
i've never used a glove before
um with a tablet and it was actually quite cool
i don't know how i feel going for it
i don't know if i'll use it much or not
you know um but it was really cool that it came with the tablet
yeah here's some footage of me just initial doodle of technical blade
um i quite like it
it's quite it's quite nice especially as a beginner tablet

hi there this is
Ranjit from tech to bus comm and in this video
I'll be doing a quick review of this Samsung Galaxy
Tab 750 this is a 10.1 inch tablet from Samsung and to unlock
this is the lock screen and to unlock the same
you just slide it and this
is this default home screen
I haven't inserted a SIM card in this
this tablet can take a SIM card to provide 3G functionality
UI on this
it is very subtle and it's nice and as you can see
the operation of this tablet is really smooth
you can easily swipe between panes and it performs brilliantly
the interactions are done via these three buttons
that's the back button home button
the browser would load and at any given time you
and if you click on the same it quickly takes a snapshot of the screen
so the user interface is really cool
let's say this is an open pane over here let's say
I want to drag the browser shortcut window
I just click here and I drag it and the shortcut goes over there
let's drop this agenda widget
I click on the same and I leave there
I like the UI interface
it's pretty easy and fluid to use and offers a lot of customization you get this
is the app tray and you scroll between the same using this and the next thing
I want to talk about is the actual screen quality of this tablet
so everything looks really great on this tablet
2 because of the sheer great resolution
that you get now moving to the web browser you get the standard web browser
this is the standard web browser that you get with the tablet
let me just open some websites to give you an idea if you open a new tab
let's go to tech me
me.com take also the on-screen keyboard is pretty good
I'm gonna click on the same and one thing I am really impressed about
this browser is how quickly it renders to their pages
everything just looks great
also pinch-to-zoom etc is silky
smooth as you can see
let me open one more tab
let us go to tech to bus comm
I just click on the same and boom
just click on this pane and it just switches so it switches pretty easily
no problems with that also as this is an Android tablet it will support
what do you say flash without any issues so just let me
just close this
you get the optimized version for the tablets for the market and
I'm loading the same right now
actually you can load any
Android app on the tablet
it does not need to be a specific tablet app
you can also load them normal
what do you say
don't get me wrong
you get a quite a few apps but again if you compare it with the native
also let me just quickly go back again to the truth of web browser again
go back to the home and let me show you the
what do you say keyboard
let me click on this and you can actually normally type like this but this keyboard also supports
what do you say swipe
so let's try
the what do you say
I'm going to quickly just start scrubbing the video and you can see that how quickly it performs
I just see I'm scrubbing the video
it's so smooth
I have noticed the battery life
I didn't do extensive testing but I've found the battery life to be also very good on this tablet
now some of the things that
so you are stuck with the storage what you get on this tablet another con that
I have with this tablet
that's thousand ATP
it's a small quibble but I just wanna let you know about the same also
I did some Skype calls on this tablet and I didn't have any issues with that
the front-facing camera works beautifully with the same
so no shoes with that also
Samsung actually loads up
Polaris Office with this tablet
so you can open up
what do you say office files
so that's a great value
according to me now let me go back
and this area is the notification pane for the honeycomb tablets
Wi-Fi sound etc
also you get a notification like you are
I'd really like about this
look to this tablet this tablet excels and actually
it's also very similar but even lighter
I hope you found this video helpful
that's it for now this is
Randy from tech tabasco
and hopefully i'm going to see you in my next video you
hello there and welcome back to the channel
today we are going to be talking about this
the dragon touch max 10 android tablet now in this video
i'm going to give you my thoughts
having spent some time with this tablet
display is housed by a small black bezel that runs around the side
on the right hand side of the device
you will find both the volume up and down the power button as well as a headphone jack
it features a webcam on the front for your video calling and on the top
you will spot the 5 megapixel camera with an integrated flash next to this
you will find the icons for each one telling you what they do
and there is a small reset button located just below the volume down
this tablet is running the android pi vision 9 operating system
and one
nice feature of this
here you can see
i've added one or two more but it still leaves me plenty of space
the next thing i just want to talk about is what you get in the box with the tablet now
so don't worry if you don't have one there is one with it
i'm not going to say it's brilliant
it isn't as good as some phones
i've heard out there or tablets that i've tried in the past but it certainly isn't the worst
there is just a slight hollowness to the sound that i do find is noticeable audible
even when it is in front of you or plug in a set of headphones into the headphone jack
overall i actually think it's a bit of a bargain
it costs 149 dollars in the us and about 140 pounds in the uk for that
the dragon touch max
10 is well worth a look now
i will put a link to this in the description of this video
that is it for this video
if you've liked what you've seen please do consider hitting that subscribe button
i'd like to thank dragon touch for sending this one over to us to actually have a play with
i am really really impressed genuinely with this one
if you'd like to support the channel please do check out our patreon page
that's it thank you for watching and i will release another video again soon
you are watching a little
TV with the brand-new Toshiba
8200 tablet
PC it's also called a called excite sometimes or it was at least last year
now we have the 10.1 inch display right here
this is one of the slimmest tablets in the world with seven point seven millimeters
we will show you what's pre-installed and as you can see already here we have
Android 3.2 installed which is quite fast
I have a new email so we I will show to you how the swipe works
unfortunately the micro SD and the micro USB port
don't want to work right now
so and we can show you local
: data bar bar trailer 1080p
let's do it again exactly then
we don't have sound because we have the
HDMI plugged in right now
but that's not important
I think for you and let's choose 720p but of course
you can see that
it's kind of hard to hit everything in the menu but yeah you can see it's smooth
it looks really nice
interestingly the eye tell of course has the same
I managed to break one
all the apps here are pre-installed
Angry Birds and on the bottom here that was just for my test purposes actually real
what actually would be the case right now so
you can see it here
that's also fast
you can even move it around
you have here the compass which shows you in which direction this is actually a non
it knows where we are so
Oh Google will find us but I don't care much then
let's go to the emails as already
said we have here a nice little email theme you already know that from
Android you can browse through your emails here
I will just compose a new one can type for example Julien
but that's actually not that interesting
let's go to English and then we can write even long words like McDonald's
we could try that that's actually
I'm not sure if that's in here
it's kind of hard for me to write upside down but at least
I'm like regular user I guess
where's the elders the
I missed that but it still knows what I wanted to write
so that's pretty nice
that's even nicer to do two-handed thumb writing or even just connecting your words by swiping
let's see if breaking works actually as a husband if you already did
McDonald's tell the other company so we have borer and no
that wasn't well oh
I see so Android is in favor of McDonald's but I don't care much as you can see here
it's pretty fast already showed you debt
we didn't register it yet
I think we have a 30 day trial here and then you can
of course see you can do a different things here and make it bold
maybe or things bold that you write you can actually make it even bigger
you can choose color and so on and so on you can hide this if you need more space and well
this is a simple editing tool of course we have the same thing for
Excel which is pretty nice and then we have the same thing for presentations
which looks like this so you can do your own
you can write anything you want
I think you should be able to select can I select the words
okay no well
I don't know you have to use it
but it's not that new you can use it with a Bluetooth keyboard so it's pretty nice
the calendar is also well standard
Toshiba 8200 which actually I forgot to show you with the iPad
2 right now you can see here
four two three display through a 16 to 9 displayed as of course some difference and in thickness
also where you can charge your device and maybe do something else
Wi-Fi if you are using it really hard right now and HDMI is connected but still
it doesn't really compare to an iPad and one other thing I forgot to show
you is a standard website actually
I'm sorry for that and we have the New York
Animalia TV my name is bars
goddess was the toshiba 8200 full test
take much watching and till next time tune in again
okay so today
stick it in the post
it's you know
is this kind of is the magnesium vapor castings that Microsoft do and it truly is
it is beautiful it is very very well finished and you know just build quality wise it's impeccable
it's just a little bit noisy
you could rock it up and down and you can hear it there
aside from that it was very very uh it was pretty good the a couple points
I did like was the accessibility to the micro SD slot which was located underneath the flap
and you can see that little micro SD card in there
I liked the power adapter
it much improved from the surface one
it's much easier to click in and click ad on the surf the first iteration the surface
it took twice as long to get it to fix him and micro-hdmi
I did use
it was functioned perfectly in screen
mirroring work wery well
USP tree read and write speeds again very good power
IPS panel as the original
I have brightness
settings are good
I'd say I'm not sure exactly what it goes up to put to my eyes
it looks like it does about 415
it's so it's not on par with the likes to some of Samsung's you know brighter option offerings
but you know really it is very good color
I'm something this size
1080p is adequate on
I think this is a 10 point
6 inch screen it is adequate you know when you get up to ultra resolution
well looks great and and that so there's nothing really wrong there
I'm honest I didn't do much gaming on this unit
I probably should have but I bought in a DDS shield so I started playing on that a little bit more
it's an even game
I played on
this was halo
Spartan assault which
I'm trying to load here
they're they've really come a long way and orti itself
it does feel like a developed platform and actually the only reason
try something a bit different and this table
I think weighs about one point
five six pounds you know it does feel a tiny bit clunky but it certainly
it's just it
it needs the active venting
but that's pretty much it the a couple of points one
it adds exception little bulk
it's about three four millimeters thick
it illuminates aluminum
this is the type
Farsight touch to cover so it's illuminated and and it
it really does work very well did
I add original touch cover
the original touch cover was not as good as this it it
it required a little bit more force on the keys and it didn't always register this
is you know this is very accurate you know
it's quick it is actually you know it's it really is very good for lengthy typing no
it's it just doesn't replicate like a full-size keyboard
I'm pretty awful
I'm a pretty awful typer but the the actual it is it is pretty good
generally you can senses
the type keyboard is better value
it's ten bucks more
it's it's probably word
run time about ten hours
I'm Wi-Fi connectivity
all that excellent
I'm very very seldom getting any drawbacks
and you know if you're looking now let's say use models and that
I'd say yeah definitely go for it
there still is not anything better out there really like a lot of the new
Atom stuff is like I've had the Dell Venue Pro Venue 8 Pro
I haven't had the the new 10 Pro and it was pretty
III enjoy the Dell product
this is a polished product the office the productivity and all that honor is
well worth your time
Lumia I don't know I'll know next week anyway
thanks for looking
Well I sure hope
my package is here today, oh hey there it is thanks
It's the KAMVAS GT-221 Pro , and I am NOT an unboxing channel, so we're just gonna get into this
Oh Inside our box
we had a nice thank-you message from
Huion. No thank you guys.
Disc, a little helpful booklet, a screwdriver to help us build!
that's a good feature
that's a good feature little little wipe
that's a good feature a stand for the back of the tablet power cables a USB.
I'm not quite sure what this one does yet?
That's a good feature HDMI cables, it's another cable
So they sent me this box and inside this box
there was another box and then inside that box there was a pen
Then they send me another box as a gift
Lovely which had another pen
I could draw with both hands.
What? They also sent me this glove which keeps me friction free
and that's my hand freeze in the chilling
Canadian winter now that
You're gonna notice how big they're this is my hand on it and
Like this is like a size of line paper
you use for like notes in school.
It's it's bigger than two of these
That's a lot of space to draw on
Remember that screwdriver
they gave you earlier
this comes in handy because they sent you four screws
you got your power cable
And you're here
There we go okay now
the review part.
Okay, first of all just a friendly tip if you're upgrading tablets
So you can get drawn real quick first thing
you're gonna notice when you use this tablet
is you have a lot of room to?
Draw, it's a big old 21.5
Need to plug it in for like five minutes
And then it lasts for three days and with two pens
that means two times the drawing
so you're gonna be super productive and you
Have a smudge guard glove, and I really like the glove
I feel fancy.
Let me tell you my hand
sure do get sweaty
But the glove solves it
well what else is there?
side button setup and a touch bar
Sixteen point seven million colors, I can't even count that many colors 8,192 levels of pressure
I can look at look how hard I could press
two pens two footlongs one dream
KAMVAS GT221-Pro ten out of ten
I got to give it a ten out of ten
So thank you very much and don't forget to
Like comment and subscribe
hey i'm ryan from technically well and i'm checking out the taj
atoll t 10 plus tablet at the time of this review
not many budget tablets
come with an octa-core processor but this one does and thanks to these eight cores
switching between applications was also very fluid with only an occasional hesitation
the display is good but it has a narrow viewing angle and can look washed out
there is a micro
SD card slot and headphone connector
I was also pleased to find that
I think you should be pleased with the performance of the t-ten Plus thanks for watching
hey everybody its Luke over Galaxy tech review and today I've got a product from irulu
this is the e X Pro x1 7 inch Android tablet
you can get this guy on Amazon
I'll have the link in the description below and this is an entry level tablet
I want to say that right off the bat
it's an entry level tablet
this would be good for your kids
this would be good for somebody
it's a 7 inch tablet which is kind of an odd size
it's not an 8
it's not a 10
I'm not quite sure whether we're going with 7
but they did a few things to mention on this tablet
I'm gonna mention the things that I don't like first
first thing is first
the resolution is pretty low
it's 1024 by 600
to be honest those are the two major cons that
I really don't like I'll show you the screen quality
it's not bad on the verticals
when you flip it a little horizontally
it washes out a little bit
that might be my third con but beyond that those are the cons now as far as a pros go
it's a $38 tablet
this is only Amazon for 38 bucks it runs KitKat 4.4.2 so it's super stable
it plays back perfect
you can do all these things
so let's plus this guy open show you what's going on
they're doing a couple different colors
there's a black
there's a blue
they do a pink and they send me the pink one
so that's the one we're gonna reviewed it as let me get everything out of the boxer for you guys
I'll show you what they give you
they giving a little bit of literature here and they give you a charge cable
this charge cable is your going to be your standard
USB to micro USB charge cable
this guy has the lower end specs but also is the lower end price too
so you are kind of intriguing one for the other
it only has half a gig of ram
that's where the slow down for loading
applications comes but not playback or not actual execution
so you've got that
I'm going to power this guy on real quick
it has eight gigs of on-board storage
I guess you can recharge it that way
but they don't supply one
you recharge it just by the micro
USB you've got a microphone you've got a rear facing camera a back firing speaker
they give you a user manual
you can check out my www.cms.gov thing
you're not gonna have to worry about that if you want to check out
YouTube it again will take a couple seconds to load up
and that's because of that half gig of ram but once things are loaded it runs really
well doesn't have any problems you know running
you're good to go you know we'll just check out you know la beasty - cactus
you know again a couple seconds
load up but look the playback is is not bad at all so that is it's pretty cool
I mean the verticals that wash out a little bit but the you know the the side besides great
the horizontals are great
I'm pretty impressed with that
so let me go home here
I'll get out of that Temple
Run another thing
you can run these things
you can run 3d games on this now
it does take a few seconds to load up
that's going to be something
Run but I'll give it a give it a quick go here for you guys and play a couple seconds of it
um you know no stuttering no nothing
I mean it does
it does what it's supposed to do
I'm pretty much when I jump
I want hit jumps and you know it does good
you know on games like this now
I do have a 1080p movie trailer on here on my external card and I want to show you
it looks how that plays back really quickly
this is for Star Trek
Beyond and we'll play it back and I'll show you guys again
this is a 1080p video
I mean actually pretty impressed with the price point that they put this out so anyway
I'll get rid of that
this is me obviously not the greatest quality but you know
hey it'll work for video chat
it'll work for what you need to do with it that type of thing the rear facing camera
I'll switch over to and you can see
I can web browser
I can watch YouTube media consumption and it all works
it's got you know the
Play Store is all there
it does have dual cameras
Google now built into it so you can ask it questions
you can do whatever you want to do
I'll just run it
it doesn't do such a bad job if you can
you know deal with a little bit of wash out there
the wash out on the the verticals obviously not horizontals
but on the verticals
if you can deal with that if you can deal with no
Bluetooth then this isn't a bad starter
tablet so this was the irulu
DX Pro X one you can pick it up on Amazon at the time of this video 438 99 go
check it out
this was luke from galaxy tech review
please remember to like and subscribe if you have any questions or comments about this guy
hey guys today
I've got the hair pad
two-in-one tablet that packs
Windows 10 and it retails for 240 dollars starting off with the design
the screen is 10.1
inches with the 1280 by 800 display which is sufficient for media consumption
the camera isn't anything special though
I would use this to take pictures on notes
millimeter headphone jack and a micro
SD card slot on the top is the power button and the volume controls and to the left is the speaker
that's acceptable but doesn't get too loud
there's a Windows logo which is actually Palmer
Start button
you can call it and it's pretty useful when you're using this in tablet mode
this keyboard case is made of soft fabric and has two magnetic parts to keep the tablet closed in
interestingly you open the flap turn the back into a triangle and rest the tablet on it
the keyboard is responsive for the most part
I liked a little flap to rest your hands on
and if you don't then you can always flip it underneath
there's also a trackpad and you can use two fingers to swipe up or down but it's really sensitive
this tablet is packed with a quad core Intel Atom processor with 2 gigs of ddr3
it's pretty good
run pretty smooth as well
I've tried modern combat 5
and it lags a lot
I also tried to play a game on Steam
Dark Souls was the only game I had
that was the least graphic and processor demanding on my list and it was pretty much unplayable
the biggest problem
I had with this is the case
I also realized that the 5 pin magnets are weak
and don't keep the tablet fully secured and the tablet slipped out and almost fell on the ground
it's just so much more smaller and lighter to carry around and it gets the job done
this tablet is also packed with an 8,000 milliamp hour battery
and it's excellent on my normal use
I easily got through two days
there was only one time when the tablet died out on me and that was when
this is a tablet for you
I missed in the description as well as any diss count codes
this is Lisa for mobile tech review
and this is the Archos 7 home tablet this runs Android 1.5 and given the name
quality isn't bad
it's plastic over here on the end caps
you've got the micro
USB port here this does support USB host
we'd have to find an adapter which is pretty challenging the headphone jack over here
power and lock over here micro SD card slot right here it has 8 gigs of built-in storage
probably in fact flexing which is a little weird
I know the thin metal
maybe or if it's actually a plastic
I suspected it just flexible metal
Arco seven here it is next to the iPhone force
what's good about the
I finally have to tap it
it doesn't have the full
Android Market also kind of a bummer
Arcos does provide something called the apps
Lib which is a customized version of an application download refer the device
it is not the fastest thing as you can see here
this is running over
Wi-Fi it does have Wi-Fi 802 and EG since
it doesn't have a cellular radio
it's neither very fast nor very stable
it's about as stable as an elephant on rollerskates
half the time it seems to crash the device try to use it
Arcos used to be great about offering updates for the device itself
new firmware is but with the Archos 7
they're done see me any updates since this first came out about
Oh two months ago or so and I believe they're outsourced or Android development so
I'm not sure we're going to see much
on the way there
you can see the available
update screen finally loaded
you can take a look
what's available for free
not a huge number again
this is pretty much all stock
I've downloaded very few there is no YouTube player here either so a mobile YouTube player app
no too bad today only with the web browser
it's easier on the eyes certainly and right now it's working on loading the Google homepage
Internet access is not terribly fast
which is surprising
this is a pretty fast
we suggest that you stay within relatively close range of your Wi-Fi access point
if you go about 20 feet or more you will see the signal drop significantly right now
we are about 25 feet from our access point
ok we turn
there is no dedicated
Android menu button here so you press the little software menu button
that's up here to get your controls and here is the Android keyboard
so here's our website
there is no pinch zooming
because it's not capacitive it's not multi-touch display likewise with the keyboard
you have to be careful
you really can't type with two fingers and do input because of that
that is the web browser next
we'll take a look at what
Arcos players are good at which is multimedia
the video player on here does a great job
this supports a variety of codecs
avi MPEG 4 stuff like that up to 720p
it will fast forward to a more interesting point of it movie
I'll crank up the volume of it
no stereo speakers
obviously it's not supremely loud
this is pretty good next
you can see it changing up here
you don't get a manual equalize
you can switch between classical pop heavy bass jazz and there is a custom so like all
what you get on here is an alarm clock
the apps let the music player
you've got a photo frame function which is pretty cool
Photo Viewer sound recorder
and you get the settings here since there is no hardware button for settings on the main menu
we'll take a quick look at the photo viewer
these are pre-loaded pictures
they're pretty fairly pretty good quality and you can scroll through like that again
I understand and if you're keeping it plugged in it's a nice alternative use for the device
I would say bring your charger with you
definitely on the road
and that's we're gonna take a look at the e-book reader that's a nice interface again this this
Android app has been around for quite some time
you want to read a book just have it
there's no accelerometer on this device
if you want to read in portrait you have to use the software controls in the reader to navigate
we are switched into portrait mode
it's pretty nice and readable looking at
it's not that fast
though it's much faster on a motorola droid than it is on this
go figure so that's the
Archos seven home internet tablet it runs Android 1.5 and
it's very reasonable at $199
can we got ours from expanses USA as a review unit
there are some things that are attractive about it
the the screen is fairly an unresponsive
the device isn't that fast
I'm Lisa from mobile tech review
visit our website to read the full review of the Archos 7
hey guys welcome back to clown fish
TV we have yet another yet
another art tablet digital art tablet
unboxing for you guys so
xB pen says the 24-inch unit which I loved
I've been using it
but they also sent us this brand-new 16 inch unit
so now we can compare
this is the innovator 16 from XP pen and I got to point out point out
look at all the clownfish
that's not because of us but that's it's good to see all the little clown fish on this
so this is their brand new 16 inch tablet
they also sent us their mascot
so here we go
let's take a look at the specs here and we're gonna unbox this unit and then
I'm gonna do another drawing and let you guys know what I think
and kind of curious
how this compares to the 24 inch unit which
I do love
just be able to make room for the 24 inch tablet
I just blew this off there
we go this is during this there he is he was really cute
so let's get that
Newtown was smelling
this is thin
oh whoa there's no feet on this one but this one
I think like you know it makes a good tripod
let's see let's see what kind of accessories we have here
this is the stand so mom take out right now
we've got our box of goodies
of course we've got pen in the nibs and for instructions
we got a cloth
yeah so we're gonna try this one out
I'm actually you know what to expect
they said we're gonna send you a 24 inch we're gonna send you a 16 inch and the 24 inch
got a click wheel and everything on them all right
so that's the tablet now some guy
Tim which is yeah
he's our mascot yeah
I know we see a fox
I think it's a fox
he's really cute
so this is a colorable model
the car both colorable mascot model so I guess you can
he's got a little
pull tab on them now
oh my god
she's got dibs on this guy
I guarantee it is
everyone is creative all right and we believe that we believe everybody can be common our teacher
I would be really roomis if I didn't
what stick him out
can we take him
oh yeah he's family
is that so yes
it's very much like a resin or something
that would be cool
but you're gonna have to fight your daughter for that yeah
I'm a strong
it's probably gonna wind up purple and black alright so we're gonna go try this tablet out
I did a drawing of I was called her bubble jam but you think she should be called
Stevie if you watched for long enough or clownfish is named bubbly Steve by me and Triscuit
so and she's supposed to be like bubbly
Steve so like it's an anime girl so she should be Stevie Stevie okay well we can call her
Stevie or bubble Chan
maybe they'll be your nickname anyway
this is a 13-inch
Wacom we reviewed this a couple months ago
so you can kind of see you know
this is a 13-inch unit
this is a 16 inch unit
there's a lot more drawing space on the 16 inch unit
but what really surprised me
now this is again her
Wacom this is how thick the 30 inch
lock-in is and it's a light unit and it's a really good local unit
we reviewed it a couple months ago
but the innovator 16 is actually thinner than the Wacom tablet which kind of blows my mind
you don't have to use a stand with it
it does have function keys on the side
it has the click wheel
you can zoom in and out very nice because you can you know
I mean this is the thickness of an iPad know how to put some earrings on them
okay but the performance
the performance is really good too
let's show you now
I mean there's no jitter
I had no problem drawing it all
it keeps up
now the only issue
I had with this one again
I had the same issue with the 24 inch
XP pen was the driver
took me a little while to get this unit
hooked up now this one
I did hook up to our gaming laptop whereas the XP pen 24 inch
I have it
if airplane seats were big enough
so it's portable
I think would fit comfortably into a laptop bag but I just love
how know this
this is very portable other than that and again
you don't even need the stand you can just take the the tablet itself
I also love the pen
this pen is thinner than the other
I think it does yeah so I'm going to go over some tech specs here for those of you
who are interested again
I had a really good experience wrong with this one
yeah we saw that
it's actually pretty cool
alright guys so here are my final thoughts on the innovator display 16
this tablet is great
it's great it's actually a lot of fun to draw on
it's feels very much like drawing on paper or drawing on an iPad
it's right-sized it's 16
inches the whole unit is about the size of a 17 inch laptop
love the stylus
it's thinner than the stylus that came with the 24 inch
XP now currently this unit is retailing for only 499 dollars
that's that's insane
I love that you've got the function keys on it
I had no problems right out of the box
it did exactly what
I wanted it to do
there was virtually no parallax at all on this unit
there's no lag loved it absolutely loved it now
here are some of the tech specs for it for those of you who are interested in the tablet
styluses battery free
again it does have tilt the interface is you
SB HTMI
it's a very compact unit so

he won this he won that and I was like whoa
whoa whoa
I never tried a Hugh on tablet before you guys so I can't help you
so we're gonna get started
we're gonna unbox it and try it out on my computer just like with my other reviews
let's get started okay so
I'm just gonna open the box first over here
I like that
I don't really need like an exacto knife or anything to open this
I probably should have opened it like this
so it's the cute 11 K tablet and you can tell it because it says it on the side all right
oh my god wait get out okay
a box inside another box nice nice
I didn't even know it was gonna be like that
I thought this was the original box but I guess it's this one
I don't even know to be honest so it turns out
I do need an exacto knife or wait do I
oh wait maybe
I don't
hooray we didn't need an exacto knife
okay then um okay
so let's oh my god
sorry if there's like random water spots it's because I just took a shower okay
I don't dry my hair okay
I don't I don't follow the rules
anyway um come on please
I know I just want to open this nicely without having to remove the other sticker
no almost there
yes oh my god that was such a workout
oh my god oh thank you for choosing huion huh what
I like this card
oh that's cute okay okay
I like that card all right
let's open it
Wow Sugoi oh my god
this is pretty big
whoa whoa whoa and on an off button no
I'm just kidding wait
tablets have on and off buttons thing
the only tablet
I know has a not enough button is the Cintiq 13 HD
am i right guys now
I'm just I'm just messing around okay
let's get this open wait
I don't get to open this part yet
whatever so there are about eight there are eight control keys
it's really light when there's a lock in and unlock and wonder what's that for
I'm King interesting
alright let's put this on the side
it's really big
it is hold on okay
I'm just gonna put the size of the tablet on the screen
here is the driver -
wow that's nice if you like
I'm unboxing like a kpop album
oh my god yes okay anyway
moving on there's the DVD instructions ticketing agent against it hmm hmm
I don't know what's wrong with me today
I can't do a normal unboxing like everyone else
okay cute oh my gosh
I love how there's these little boxes okay you know
I'm a sucker for packaging
I love packaging and this
oh my god there
is it more in here okay
there isn't it right okay good
Wow okay I just love opening little boxes so and it tells you what's in it
oh my god okay seriously
this is great because honestly like with the Cintiq
it wasn't even like this
they just threw it in there
they were like here you go
here's your stuff but this is like here's your stuff your highness and I'm like oh my god
I just exaggerated that so much but seriously I love this okay
whoa this is really nice great job like
I don't know what I'm doing
okay so here are the two pieces so I know for sure it should come with or does it come with nibs
wow that's really nice okay
so here's how the pen holder looks says huion on it
it has some nice dots on there
yeah okay let's put that okay so next we have this um this is all the cords and stuff correct
yep okay easy easy easy
what's this
oh okay cool so
there we go
I first started drawing on here
it was just me kind of warming up
I really like this tablet and I'm not just saying that I actually like I can't believe this
it's really nice
the texture is so nice like the texture of the tablet is not too smooth and not too rough
Wacom I would have some kind of disconnect where I have to take some time to get used to it
like what is going on and the size is really nice like I just felt really comfortable
that's about 15 inches or 13 inches diagonally
those are the most comfortable ones
I started out with a small tablet
it was really small and it would kind of hurt my wrist because I would have to keep moving around
I would definitely recommend going with this size
also you guys
I did not show myself drawing in the corner like I usually do like you know with the actual tablet
yes alright so anyway the only thing
oh my god like it's a normal it's like
I only had one problem with it and that was just my laptop being a but but um yeah
I did use my laptop on this so just let you guys know
you don't need a huge heavy hardcore computer to make this work
just a basic laptop will do just fine though yes anyway
better like you know in my painful size so I was like whoa Nelly
what's going on here anyway um
I don't even know what I was gonna say
oh yes so if you guys want to check it out
I'll put the link in the description
I think it's like 120 right now on Amazon
and that's pretty good for a wireless tablet for me
I got my welcome for like a hundred
this was like four or five years ago
this one uses a little USB card
you don't even need like the huge chunky piece to attach to it
just to make your wireless cuz it's already wireless to begin with anyway before
I choke and die right now
so if you guys are kind of confused as to whether or not you should get it
I don't know I really really like it
I'm just really shocked
I don't really have any other words for it to be honest
yeah it's just like it just has everything you could ever want
it wasn't even the the tablet that was bothering me
so it's like what do
I say at this point and the pen is really lightweight too so I was like there's nothing I can say
that could kind of be like
oh yep this is a valid review
because there's this and this wrong with you you know what
I mean there's nothing really wrong with it to be honest
so yeah if you guys are really confused as to what to get
I definitely say just try it out for yourself and see if it works for you
that's the only way you can really judge and see if it's good
yeah anyway
thank you guys for watching
I love them
criticisms in my right guys alright thanks for watching and I'll see you in my next video
bye bye oh yes by the way guys before
hi guys and welcome to another unboxing video if you remember my last unboxing video
we unboxed a gaomon graphics tablet
we are doing the same today except it is a newer model
it is the gaomon m106k pro
so let's crack it open and take a look again
just like the previous tablet
this has a really nice solid
look to it really professional looking
i love the silver embossment on this one
it just looks really nice
i love minimalism in graphic design
it's just really pretty so let's check out inside here
we have the main board of the tablet
you have a pouch for your tablet a little pouch for your pen a glove
they just give you all these nice little extras and it's just
it's really nice to see this
one also came with a really cool little
thank you note which i think is really sweet
it's really nice now
let's set it up with my laptop and check it out here
it is all set up and i actually found out it
it was really easy to install
i post on a lot of social media
there just really helps me out and helps me keep creating content
so it'd be great if you could check it out other than that
i was looking for a good large tablet at a good price and i think i may have found it
what's happening panda nation
peter von panda
here check this out
it's by dragon touch right there
and this is an android tablet and it's a big one
this is a 10 inch android tablet
it's called the max 10 plus plus size model
you know what i'm saying
listen this thing
has some pretty awesome specs
it runs android 10
hopefully this will be the business you can see
see the dragon touch logo on there
we have a really nice case and it's got a bead blasted look and obviously black
it's really cool
you can see here
it's very thin
it looks like we have a volume rocker
the power switch and a three and a half millimeter headphone jack
right there so pretty awesome
it's coming on right away dude
that's a beautiful looking screen
that is like true blacks on that bad boy
i mean that looks great
but i tell you what this is going to be my companion on my next trip
i think this is just so big so what i want to do
i'm going to show you here that the back here
i think is plastic
there are also two sim card slots there too
what up let's see boom
it makes it so much easier than a fingerprint reader
alright so i also want to show you that
as expected it has an accelerometer built in there
is maybe just a little bit of lag on
its responsiveness i don't know if that's pretty typical of android
it seems like the apple devices
the one thing that i really want to call out in this and you can see the stock wallpaper on here
the screen on this little bad boy is amazing so it is one huge
i think 10 inches here but it is just incredible in fact
i don't know if we would use the term retina display but at 1920 pixels on the long edge man
i just don't see any pixelation
it just looks great
the colors are vibrant
i mean the colors are super bright
everything about this is absolutely amazing
you can see here
this is probably the weakest
part of this tablet is that the speakers are good
they get loud
they're always very clear
it's been perfectly fine
i've consumed a ton of video on here
so it's a nice clean unmolested version so i don't really have to learn anything
it's really nice and simple
i think it's going to be really really simple for you now
the last thing i want to talk about here is the overall experience
so this is a very big tablet
it's comfortable in the hand
it's not super heavy
the construction seems very nice
this thing is phenomenal and i would think at this price point
like an eight inch tablet
because it's a really high-priced piece of equipment
i think this is the one for you
so if you want to pick up this dragon touch
i think it's a really great big tablet
that's probably going to satisfy almost everyone's needs
i'll put a link to it in the description below peter
von panda out
hi folks so today
we're looking at this
I'll explain why shortly so stick with me for that
so here's a quick draw test that I did quite early on while testing out this tablet
this is actually a lot of fun and I got to grips with the tablet quite early on
I was surprised how well the tablet performed
and yeah
this was a quite a lot of fun
this tablet is fifteen point six inches in size
I'm left-handed obviously but yeah you can see that
the tablet has kind of a greenish tinge to it
you know you can see on the screen recording
it's fully black but don't worry about that
a lot of that is my camera but yeah as you can see
I love these
I thought they were absolutely great
they did certainly make me laugh
also this guide to all of their other tablets came as well
I wasn't quite sure
what the masked tablets were
I presume they are the same tablet sold under a different name in different areas
you can see the ports there which we'll get another look at right here so moving on here
we can see all of the specs and they're looking pretty good
I'm impressed that this has USB C is host powered the viewing angle
looks good
and yeah
we've got everything we want
it's got a fixed and built in
the resolution is 1080p
which is something
I'm seeing quite a lot from tablets that I've reviewed in the past couple of weeks
it's a small tablet though
this is a 16 inch tablet
this is absolutely fine now
this works with Windows and Mac OS X now
let's get on to the unboxing looking forward to this one
nothing really fancy here but the case is nice and sturdy
it's gonna last you while you're carrying around that pen now
the pen is actually nice
it's very stylish
it's got a good grip to it
here's the thing that
I wasn't expecting which is one cable
here you have
now that's all one cable
there's also a mini
CD with drives on but you can go and download the drivers which I certainly did
there's an instruction manual which
I personally use my own artist glove but here we go just to show you that our glove in use
now let's get to the setup we can see straight away
how handy that one cable is no string of cables and the multitude of cables
they haven't used any of those old fashioned cable inputs
you know no
RGB no VGA cables
it's just one cable
that does everything and they've used
I'm used to only doing for touches
this used eight to calibrate it
it did get it calibrated
nice and quickly for me there so I was really happy with the setup
the colors straight away on setup were nice and accurate the one thing
the parallax isn't too bad
it was giving me nice straight lines
well you'll get a lot of use out of this
I was happy with this
it was giving me smooth lines
it was more or less absolutely fine
you know there was some difference in variation but barely any
it was pretty good if you look at the tests here on screen
I think the same as I do of a lot of these tablets too had a soft rubber nib
that would be awesome and that initial pressure would be absolutely fine but pen pressure wise
absolutely great moving on to the drugs first day
I spent about an hour and a half on this draw test
that one at the beginning of the video was about 10-12 minutes this one
I spent about an hour and a half on
this is full color one
I was very happy with this one
the initial sketch for this was five minutes by the time
you're watching it here
it's a piece
I think I'm going to work up to a finished piece for a little host powered 16 inch drawing tablet
I can't say the Pens amazing individually
I can't say the tablet felt wonderful but the pen does feel good
the tablet does feel well-made
it's just one of those small things
I do think this is a great drawing tablet especially for the money
it's just those couple of things
it's definitely a good tablet for the right person
now you can see the screen
there looks slightly greenish
I spent a couple of days tinkering with the color calibration now to me
it didn't bother me too much
you can see the difference between the video and the screen capture out of the box
that's just the way it is so it's up to you which way you want to go
don't be put off by the fact that my video is a bit greenish
you can see at this point that the illustration has actually come on quite well
I'm actually managing to do quite a bit of work that I'm quite happy with by this stage
I know his face looks a bit squished as well
that always happens when you're filming what you're drawing
let me know what you think below in the comments
I'd love to hear
is this something you go for
is this a drawing tablet that sparks your particular interest
what drawing tablet have you got
what drawing tablet would you like
does this tick enough boxes for you for me
let's say a surface book
that's kind of cool
you know it gives you a variety of ways to work
if you're a student that means you could take this to university
we have just a regular laptop allows you to work like that and that's kind of cool
it just means that
I have to lean across my own hands to press hotkeys
this isn't so much of an issue it just means that
I don't end up using the hotkeys so much now for filming
it's okay because it means that my hand doesn't get in the way when
I do it if I was using the tablet without filming it
I did wonder if I put the wrong drivers in but yeah again
I just confined it
you'll notice there that
I just pre transformed the picture so he wasn't as destroyed and that looks
look a bit creepier
this isn't anyone in particular
this is apparently what he looked
it communicated very well with the computer I was using
they were absolutely great
they had good trouble
the rotating ring was clean
it had good movement it clicked
well a 15.6 inch screen for me personally
I prefer something bigger
everybody knows that everybody knows
that's just me
I know a lot of us more comfortable with a 16 inch row
they may only have the room in the studio for a 16 inch
I would want something a bit higher resolution like a 4k
and that's all that matters at the end of the day
I talk to a lot of younger digitalized
I ought to think that the tablet is the reason for the lack
I still only have Photoshop open or Corel Painter open whatever app I'm using
I still only have that one application open
editing only premiere is open why because it slows down your computer up a lot even though
I've got a mega powerful computer
you see now that
I've changed the tonal value of plants
face this is where really came to life me
this is where
I really started enjoying this pain
it really felt
I know it's cheesy but I think with a little more work could I do that
work on this tablet definitely
I think but it would be more time consuming and as a professional illustrator
I think it's easier to move over to a larger drawing tablet and do it quicker
that's no offense to the powered life for me
working on a larger drawing tablet means
I can do it faster
also having tilt and rotate on my pen means
it's just about tidying up those other things that they could bring in
the tablet is pretty decent
it's looking pretty cool
I'm happy with this
let me know what you think in the comments below
let me know if you like this would you think of the illustration that
I've done
what do you think of the tablet itself
what do you think of stylus or do you think that balling one cable
I'm pretty happy with this
you could attach this to a laptop take it out on the go
you could take it to university
sit around in the studio sit around and electric via put the tablet on top of the keyboard
and then you know you've got kind of an all-in-one right there with two monitors
I mean that's pre swish
you save money instead of buying a surface book or something
let me know what you think in the comments below
do you like it
is this something you'd buy
have you already got one
give me a tweet let me know and I shall speak to you very shortly
I can't wait to see what you think of this until next time
have a very good day
we have these drawing tablets
I'm gonna be doing some comparison videos
Pablo versus Wacom
this is shoe yarn
I've got here in the studio
yeah okay so absolutely cool actually see you soon have a great there
welcome to panels and borders
I'm Dominic and I just wanted to make a video about the huion tablet
I bought the Huey on back probably in 2013
is it still
that's still a pretty hefty price
the customer service is not very good because you got to contact them through
Facebook and the responses are slow
and there's not really a number to call so to me
it's not worth it
if you're going to get a tablet it might seem like a good deal
save your money wait longer get wake up now what
I'm using right now to ink this piece of artwork
this is a character that a friend of mine wanted me to design for him
Bamboo tablet just a small one
I have never had any issues installing it
I've never had any issues using it
so if the more expensive tablets or anything like they're cheaper tablets definitely go with
Wacom and avoid the huion because it might seem cheap but to me it totally is not worth it so for
sure the next tablet i buy will be a
Wacom I will never ever get another huion tablet again as long as I live like
I don't even use it anymore every time I try to use it
it's not worth it like all that hassle when you paid all that money is not worth it
Wacom so in my opinion for someone who's owned the Wacom tablet since 20
some one whose own I mean a Huey on tablet since 2013
don't don't buy to avoid this tablet
it's nothing but a big head headache
forgive me on this one anyway
today we do a tablet review for kalman
i was contacted to do one
so here we go
this one's model is called gaomon pd1161 a small display tablet about 10 by 6 inches
it's a pretty small boy and lucky for gauma and i'm a huge sucker for small display
tablets i love drawing on display tablets
more than those that i just pen tablets
i've seen so far are those that are pretty heavy
built and basically cannot really fit my workspace
interesting enough expensive tablet brands
i'd have to comment that
i feel like there's something missing with the package display
tablets are easy to work with
if you have something
i'm pretty sure
gaomon sells tablet holders separately
this would probably help first-time buyers a lot
the installation of the driver is not that difficult
then you'd need to manually set it up on your computer with a few clicks and then there you go
your tablet can work now
the colors at default doesn't really match my computer
there started drawing and i find the screen very pleasant to work with
would the lines look clean despite not having stabilizer on
how accurate does the pen go
it was smooth to work with and i just love it in general okay
i genuinely appreciate this tablet
what isn't really good about it
however is that there is no tablet holder to put the tablet on goldmine
you already have a full set of accessories
maybe you could add just one more to make it
you know user friendly also
i really didn't like the fact that it involves a lot of connectors
it makes my desk look a bit of a mess
it's light convenient and you can bring it everywhere
it only connects to a computer though
so i know you guys use phones and stuff but yeah this is a heads up anyway
i personally recommend this tablet
and you'd know why if you've come this far and actually listened to the whole video anyway
this is my new tablet now
that's all for now for this video
thank you so much for watching
hello friends and welcome to another youtube video
i hope that you guys have been well
i am very excited to say that
today's sponsor is xp pen
i will be reviewing three of their new drawing tablets
that is in collaboration with line
unboxing of me opening up all the packages
i want to say that i have been using a wacom
bamboo tablet since grade 11
that was gifted to me by my uncle
and so
that's my that's where we're upgrading from
the boxes alone are adorable
and so i guess i will open them from the smallest to the biggest
just put those aside there
oh my goodness it is so adorable
one the tablet is so tiny and compact great for traveling
that's insane
i guess
this is a protective film
we got the extra nibs the cutest little notepad
this is the best brand collaboration ever
so we've got another cover
oh my god guys i'm gonna die
this is so cute
okay let me one thing at a time
let's open this first okay so similar to the first one
uh we've got a adorable printed line play characters on there
ooh squishy very cute
so we've got the nibs cable
we've got the big boy here
i cannot get over all these line
play themed items so we've got
it's a toad bag
i'm very very excited about this
i'm so excited
i love that
we've got our line play branding on it
it's so cute
oh my this is the greatest thing i've ever seen
so this is the stand
and i've watched a few reviews on xp tablet display things
i don't need a super intense incline
so we got our guide another cute pencil pouch another glove some more
oh and this is nice comes a little thing to clean your uh screen which will be good
because i'm sure i'll get lots of fingerprints on it
the other thing with this is it also has a container for the pen if i can get it out
okay so yeah we've got our nibs in here which is actually quite nice
yes oh ooh i like the the silicone-y feel of it
that's nice all right and on to the review
so first we're going to start out with the smallest one the star g640
i'm using photoshop
but it's totally seamless
uh you can't tell that there's even an image there it's completely flush
there's no worries about that
and so given its size and it's really affordable price point
but i would say that you might as well upgrade to a larger size
is that this pen
i found that it was
the smaller tablet came with one as well
it actually doesn't really move around either
i think because of the way that they die
i decided to try and quickly
i am mapping out a figure here and this is kind of the way that i like to draw my figures
ready to go for keys that i find are a little bit harder to reach on my keyboard so yeah overall
i think that this is a great starting drawing tablet
i think this is a great starting point so something to kind of introduce you to this
yeah i'm really happy with it
which of course is different
it's a bit more on the shallow side in terms of the angle
i'm sure that you can get a other stands for your tablet if you really want to and then here
i really really like the dial the wheel on the side to be able to zoom in and out
i put where i found that the buttons are handy as well and here you can see
i'm actually testing out the glove
i put it on because i actually had just put hand lotion on
so that was a really nice thing to have but overall
i don't think that i will really need to use the glove
most of the time and then here i just switched over to the screen
and yeah basically
i'm just kind of fiddling around with it as you guys already know
some areas were super smooth and then some were a touch gritty
i don't know if maybe that was the nib or the angle
these are programs that i don't actually use on my ipad because i'm worried about you
you don't have to worry about charging the drawing tablet or the pen
that's another thing that i really enjoyed
because i hate having to wait for x y and z to charge and so another thing about that is
i found that i didn't feel like it was getting really really hot
i find that my ipad
um because it's so small and so light
i think that this is a great alternative
because it's definitely going to be something that is an investment and so for me
they're at and also at many different price points
hey there in this video
we're going to be reviewing the XP pen artist 15.6
this is a display drawing tablet
alright welcome everyone
my name is Kay Michael Russell
it's the first time that's happened
I believe so yeah
I've made it so anyway
it's it's a big box
so let's get this thing open and actually before we open out
I thought I'd do a quick run-through on the technical specs here
I don't know if you guys can see that's probably not on the camera
I didn't notice right off
the main box is a big white box sorry
I've like I have no space here
so here's what it looks like in the box
let's get it out of here so I can get this big box out of the way
okay so boring stuff first
let's look at a little accessory box
see what's in here and this is an actual unboxing
I have not looked at this
it's all this black stuff on black background
it didn't work so anyway
start off with plugs
this is the plug that
so this goes to the power adapter according to the sticker
I don't know about the other one
there's also it looks like uh it was at mini DisplayPort
I think to HDMI
maybe we'll see one of those fancy two finger gloves which
I've never really used
but if you want to
okay let's get all this stuff out of the way okay
so this is the tablet
it's lighter than I expected it to be
it's got this cover on it
so let's get this off
this little sticker says please peel off this mask
I don't know if I'll clear on that yet
so you guys can still see okay
sorry so in the box there are
yeah and there's only one port
I think since where I left you guys
I'll put a picture somewhere
this is a first world problem
I realized that but yes my MacBook only has USB sea ports so I had to buy the adapter again
turn it off and on again and after that
I did run the calibration software and that seemed to work
that seemed to work
okay and that's really all
keep looking over at the keyboard to see what
I should be pressed
that's how used to working on a
Mac I am so while I'm flatting this since this requires very little brain power
the number is there's there's definitely this is only a 1080p screen
okay so it's full
I will try to do that calculation and put it in the video when I'm editing
this just seems to be the place where it's most obvious but for the price right now
I'm actually impressed with this with this thing because honestly you can't expect a you know
some pictures of this too is
I could see the difference in the visible gamut like the visible colors that this can duplicate
I've noticed it with some pages more than others and I'll show you guys what I did on
I put it side-by-side with my macbook my Mac books have pretty good color representation
I don't know what the numbers are
I'll try to figure that out too but the like on this device
spider-man was like the red was coming out more saturated than it did on my macbook or my desktop
I actually kind of looked at both and I think I've got pictures of both
I don't know how big of a deal that is
honestly you're definitely going to be what's where
I'm looking for like I think if you put this just on its own
I ever need to get you know when you're brushing
that's one thing or and so far so good
I'm having to stop myself from doing gestures on the screen because again I'm Way too
used to procreate right now but so far so good and let's just keep coloring all right so
I'm a little shocked
honestly it's you know
I'll get to the pros and cons at the end for sure
there are a few of both but for the price you know
I said 400 earlier
I thought it was and I was looking at this before
this is actually three $59.99
three hundred sixty bucks us on
I think that would probably be the equivalent
they're both about the same size yeah
I'm like I said I I honestly didn't have high hopes and to clarify something here
I just to be very clear
this was not a sponsored video
they didn't pay me to do the video
they didn't give me any
you know
oh you have to say this you have to say that you know none of that
I kind of expected to be let down by this like a lot
I expected to find a lot of problems I really did and I'm just
I'm not really seeing them
I mean I'll go down my so pros and cons here real quick pros
it's an expensive
I it doesn't feel cheap though as far as the the build quality is very solid
it's extremely comfortable like it's got this sort of soft touch
plastic all the way around the bezels
because if you want to draw on your screen and it really does make a big difference
this within this is srgb
that's the smaller gamut there
I realized that I actually misspoke there
i showed earlier where some of the colors looked a little bit more or less saturated but i
I don't know if it's a big enough problem for me to say like you know
there's just the eyeball test
it's not a big difference
it's really not so yeah three pros like I said the price I mean
it's the resolution is one it's like
I think part of the reason that I made that I noticed that so much is I'm kind of a junkie
for sharpness and image quality can ask my wife like
it's subtle and if you're not used to it you would probably not even think it's an issue but again
I'm coming from you know really dense high pixel density screens so it seemed really obvious to me
which is the distance between the pen and the screen
it seems like a lot relative to again what
I'm coming from but once I got going with it I really didn't notice it
I calibrate it it is because I calibrate it from my eye
the angle is different
if that makes sense you know so
make sure you're calibrating it
I'm just not used to
there is some kind of protective film over it that
I'm not used to working with
and and they they recommend not removing it
there's actually two films when you when you open this thing up
you tear off the first one that just protects and shipping
and then there's one that's like super stuck to it
it might just be a translation issue but on the website it says it supports 4k
now this is not a 4k display
I guess at some point there was a driver issue with that
so when it says supports 4k keep that in mind it is not a 4k monitor
okay this is a 1080p monitor
which means it's a quarter of the pixels that are in 4k
the stylist is very comfortable
it feels a lot like the
Wacom stylus that comes with the Cintiq
s' there's no battery nothing to worry about there
I have no complaints about that
the only thing about the pin that it took me a while to figure out was
I accidentally bumped the eraser button
I guess and it took me forever to figure out what I was doing because I knew it wasn't
I think it's a
it's going to be obvious that this is a 1080p display
okay the other thing is if you work on you know like high resolution you know
print photo editing
whatever for you know magazines and that's your job
you know maybe that color gamut comes into effect a little bit
I just I really didn't see much of it like I said the eyeball test
really you know didn't make much of a difference for what
I could see and my know my monitors calibrated that
I was comparing it to so they were
I don't remember if I mentioned this earlier
I don't have to return it but I wasn't paid for the review
I wasn't told what's a you know
any of that kind of stuff that they wanted an honest review
this is not a sponsored video
I'm not getting paid for it if you buy based on the link in the description
Home and Student 2013
it is powered by a quad-core intel atom z3580
we're looking at here
there's a 1.2 megapixel webcam
the keyboard is a small chiclet style setup
there's a volume rocker and an app
there's an SD card
slot for storage expansion micro
that's a complete fingerprint magnet
but it's a rugged sort of coating regardless that resists scratches nicely the t100
it's a pretty snappy
performance is pretty solid
pretty impressive screen sharing in general and multitasking with Windows 8 1 in the benchmarks
we are running the 3d mark ice norm benchmark and the T 100 ta puts up scores
that were slightly faster than an iPad
make sure you stop by haha
Wacom for a full review with all the benchmark details
I'm Dave alte villa here with the Asus Transformer book t100 ta thanks again for stopping by
tablet review
hey everyone it's siege
welcome back to another video so for today
we're gonna be doing yet again
another tablet review
we've reviewed gaomon
we've reviewed xp pen and now we're going to be reviewing article
artisol has sent me one of their tablets
which is the m0610 pro right now
yeah i said it right
article has not sent me only one though
oh gosh they sent me two of them
because i'm gonna be giving one away eat
i might drop the tablet
i'm gonna be giving away to my instagram followers
only though so make sure to follow me on instagram
also article and instagram as well
so yeah let's see if this tablet is good
i don't know let's find out
let the unboxing begin
alright so unboxing here you can see the box
looks really fancy right
let's see if the insides match and it does awesome
the first thing you can see is the warranty card for the warranty policy
then that pamphlet where it tells you to download the driver
then you can see the tablet itself
we'll check that out in a little
while right below the tablet you can see a bunch of things
we have the pen case
and it's battery free
we have the smudge guard or the artist glove
i just call it artist club because i'm an artist myself and would you look at that
it fits my hand perfectly
then we have the cleaning cloth to clean the tablet obviously and there is the quick start guide
then there is the cable so that we can connect the tablet to the computer or our android devices
some extra nibs for the pen
in case it wears off along with the nib remover
and two adapters
one is a micro usb and one is a usbc then unpackaging
the tablet looks really nice
it has eight keys and a dial and below the tablet
it has four rubber feet
so that whenever you're working it'll just stay in place and that's all that's in the box
okay guys so i'm about to test it on this phone right here
i tried it in my main phone
i tried this one but it didn't seem to work
um it kind of sought as a charger instead
i followed the instructions as well but still nothing happened
so i'm just testing this with my backup phone my old phone
um hopefully this works this time
okay yeah it does work
i don't know you can see it
i'm not sure why it's not working with my other phone though
so maybe it's just that but yeah yeah either way
it still works on the phone
it's just my issue but yeah it works perfectly fine before anything else
keys of the tablet
actually but it's kind of a waste of a shortcut key though
i don't really mind since i don't really use shortcut keys
that much testing it out in paint tool sai and the pressure sensitivity is working
well now let's get into drawing for the speed paint
i decided to draw millie
she is one of the gacha tubers
that inspired me to use live cd and she is an amazing gadget
tuber and artist
i'm gonna leave her channel link in the description box below if you want to check her out
let's find the way together few
i swear we never and what is forever
wait another day to clear my thoughts
that won't be forgotten forever
feel it it's like i can't walk on the scene
oh yes okay
the short cookies are really clicky and handy
the pen is pretty responsive the work area is just right not too small not too big
it feels really nice to draw on
and it's affordable
i really recommend this tablet for beginners intermediate artists or even hobbyists
if you're interested in getting this i will leave all the details in the description
box below magic and that is all for the m0610 pro review from artisan
if you guys enjoyed the video be sure to leave a like comment
ding ding for more videos for more reviews probably anyways siege out love
you guys see ya you
it's coming right up
hey guys do Daniel Dodson tut vidcom
and let's talk about the
this is brought to you by my weekly podcast
the we geeks podcast which you can find over at we geeks podcast.com
ring thing on the side the wireless capabilities are just the beauty of this tablet
it was like seeing
HGTV for the first time indescribable
grab your pencil and sketch away
and you can't use your pencil in Photoshop
so that's going to knock it down
it's really difficult to sketch or draw with
it's always been kind of clunky so we'll give that a three now speed kills and the
Wacom sits on my desk everyday not sure how I'm still alive
you pick it up and paint
this one is super natural
I'm going to give it an eight and next up
we're going to talk about functionality
first we've got the pen and pencil or the pencil and paper
I should say you put the pencil to paper
you get results
I can't retouch or use my pencil in Photoshop and that hurts so I'm only going to give it a four
right there on the tablet
the functionality virtually literally drips off of a good tablet
it never gets old
that gets an eighth
I've used a mouse since I was three years old
if the results don't really need to be really really great
I'm going to give it a 7 now for the Wacom
pat the wacom hums so nicely
it's super smooth
feels really good but doesn't really come near real real pencil and paper though so
I'm going to give this a 6 now for price
typically you're going to pay about $50 depending on which direction you go for a really great
it was 300 49.99
that's what it retails at so
I got it
I was proved right because as I mentioned before this child of all things
beautiful and lovely has changed the way
let me know how your tablet has changed your work or maybe if you think
my rankings are flat-out insane
how would you rank these things
what do you think is the most valuable is a tablet even worth it or do you find that
there are other great alternatives to a
Wacom tablet and why I would love to hear from you about this
make sure you go ahead and like the video
that always helps a lot and is a super cool way that you can help out this video
are you going to get a tablet
I would love to hear from you below that's it for this one
thank you much for watching
Athena Dodson touch vidcom catch you guys later
hey guys it's the arts here
and today i will unbox and review the human inspiroi inc h320m
so let's get started first
i got this very cool box
that the drawing tablet is inside
okay now let's open the box now and here is a little
okay now here is the cable for plugging the drawing tablet to your device
and here's the pen
you are going to be drawing with these are adapters
i will show you that later next
we will have the pen holder
also a wiper cloth to clean those spots and smudges on the tablet
okay let's put all these stuff away and let's take a closer look at this drawing tablet
this is the work area outlined here
it's a half a glove and it goes on your ring and pinky finger and what it does
it prevents your hands from putting those prints and spots on the tablet
okay how about the adapters
they there are two in case
one doesn't go into your device if both adapters
don't go into your android device plugging the cable to your computer
without the adapter should be your best bet
i will have a link in the description if you want to check it out
and wow this
it works just practice now
it's super good
i would give it a solid 10 out of 10.
you guys have a great rest of your day
see you all in the next video bye you
hey I'm Chris Velasco from Engadget
and today we're taking a look at this
felt beauty is the Sony Xperia z2 tablet
sony says it's the world's thinnest and lightest waterproof tablet but isn't worth the price
they're trying to stay out of things as much as possible when it comes to design
it's really minimalist so the same deal with the front
all you've got is the screen
because this is a waterproof tablet
you would think that would get in the way but it actually doesn't
I've taken this in the shower
it does work
we'll talk about that later as well
your power and your volume rocker and up top
we've got a couple things with note
we do have a micro
SD card slot
and we do have the micro USB charger port
they're both sealed here
you can pop a fingernail in there to open it up
let's talk about this screen
this is really the star of the show here
Samsung's Galaxy Note pro
I think has it beat but in terms of color reproduction
it's actually very aggressive
and that's because of Sony's triluminos screen technology in terms of performance
it's no slouch either since it does have the latest
Snapdragon 801 chipset running the show in there it does also come with three gigabytes of RAM
I'm firing up
Need for Speed Most
Wanted right here
there's no way
I haven't seen any dropped frames
everything runs incredibly smooth
this is one of the fastest tablets that you're going to find out there on the market right now
Sony is obviously one of the biggest names in media and entertainment out there
google play music through the
same goes for movies
we're able to swipe through
Sony's media collection and download
whatever it is you're ready to move for all
Sony has done a pretty fine job of covering up Android hero a lot of us are fans of stock Android
I myself and very firmly in that corner
but if you had to go if you absolutely had to go with a overlay that sits on top of it
Stoney's is probably the least offensive like it or not
and that's that that's not just because of my face now
eg tablet is that it is dustproof and waterproof
that's an ip55 and ip57 client
they've just about nailed it if you're on the market for a 10.1 inch Android tablet
keep your eye on this guy
it is one of the best out there right now and that is a fact the Xperia z2 from Sony
it's physically almost identical to the z1
that came out last year and also to the Xperia Z before that but looks can be
what is going on guys
Greg Iles TV
this is a review of the dragon
touch max 10 tablet
it goes for about a hundred and forty five bucks on Amazon
sure on that on the charger
I really wish they'd put USB see now this tablet runs Android 9
the colors are gonna pretty much stay the same
I said any angle which is always an awesome thing with a tablet
is it gonna be good
you know like gaming for instance
let's load up a game here
we'll load up asphalt 9 here
we go get some gaming on with the asphalt 9 just to show you it runs
I played a game of this game already and it runs it fairly well
and it's not amazing but you would think you know for 145 bucks
I think they it just performance alone
you can do a fair amount of stuff on this
the battery is 5,000 milliamps
and it seems you know fairly decent for the time
I've used it
it's a 1080p display and a five thousand milliamp battery
I haven't had too much
you know issue with any of that you can see while
I'm in here
you can see 32 gigs of space
Android 9 is on here about the tablet 2 gigs around max 10 android 9 but
they're very bad
the speakers are awful on this to be honest with you
I don't even know if you can tell but they sound awful
the speakers that the screen is very you know especially for the price
the speakers are horrendous horrendous
so you do have a headphone jack right here and I'll you know
show you around the tablet a little bit later in the video but the speakers are awful
they sound tinny they sound low they don't they don't have good volume
they're just they're bad they're awful and just give you a quick little peek around this tablet
you've got your volume keys up and down
you get your power you get your headphone jack
you have at the top here the micro USB charging port
you have nothing out right there
nothing on this side at the bottom
you have the two stereo speakers which sound awful and on the back
you have a camera along with right here
you'll put the aged pop that off and put in the micro SD card in there and then other than that
you do have a camera on the front as well at the top in the middle
this is a 5g tablet so
I just wanted to do a speed test on the Wi-Fi with my Galaxy Note 10.1
you can see that got a score of 239
Meg's download 36 upload and this was just know five minutes ago or so
and let's check out upload upload speed so obviously
I'm running it on the tablet right now but on my note 10
I got a score single core of 716 and a multi core of 25 at 71
I'm on an android 9 Qualcomm Snapdragon 855
which is the best processor
so we'll see what kind of score we get on the tablet
hey guys there you go an awful school or 145 them a single core 626 on multi scores
I think it runs really really well
so if you're gonna use this for like Netflix or like YouTube or like stuff like that
I said because that the the sound on
this is just horrendous
so it's good that you can plug in a pair of headphones
it's not amazing and
I said earlier when when you don't install any apps on this you get about 25 gigs of free storage
but again you can add more via the microSD security and location
there's no fingerprint or there is face unlock
which if you set up
it's not going to be secure face
unlock so just keep that in mind but it does that face and lock
there's no fingerprint either
so you won't be able to do a fingerprint on here the if you go into
I believe it's system and then you go into gestures
there's a couple of gestures in here
you can jump to camera by to quickly open camera
double press the power button
so you can do that if you turn that on and you double press the power button
it'll launch the camera
I'll sort of prevent ringing
you can see you can press power volume up to turn it
you can select what you want to do it to mute it or do nothing or turn it on to vibrate
if there's a system update you can come in here and check to see if there's one
I checked a few days ago when there was not again
you could use the speakers but they just sounds awful
you can do some gaming on here as well web browsing looks decent
let me open up
Chrome for you just so I can shake and you can see that a load up the Samsung website
and you know you can do that stuff if you want if you need to
it'll look fine
you can open at up and open up tabs and stuff
you can see a lot of this stuff doesn't stay put it kind of reloads it just because of the low
RAM amount on here
so don't think you're gonna be available to you're gonna be like a multitasking
King on here
yeah cuz you will not be home
I mean if you can run
now let's see if you can run multiple windows yeah
I guess you can run multiple windows on here
thanks for watching
see you guys down the road
what's up guys it's will from tech beat
TV bring it to you a review
this is of the wacom intuos4 bluetooth wireless pen and tablet for this video
I'll provide a short summary
kind of my overall thoughts and any downsides of the product
why don't we start and dive right in
alright guys is the review portion of the way
come in two
O's for Bluetooth pen tablet
this is a wireless pen tablet from
wakeham it does incorporate a few things provided accessories you do get about a three meter micro
let's go into the actual pen tablet itself
you can make various adjustments
but let's go over the other aspects
it does come with a programmable keys
it does come with standard pre-programmed values does have this scroll wheel as well as a middle
button right there
the battery is readily removable and accessible
it's right through this door right here
if you do run into any issues you can be away comes of website
connections was relatively easy with this device
I was able to connect to my 27 inch imac relatively easily
I have other devices that are connected via bluetooth
no interference know anything like that
I didn't get any skips or inaccuracies when using Photoshop or anything like that
so the connectivity was great
it says it's up to about 33 feet
I lost some an act
it was pretty good but other than that
no real issues with the connectivity
let's dive right into the next segment and kind of show you how it performs inside applications
I'll use Photoshop it as an example
actually have the tablet self right
here it's fully connected
it's on right now
I use it on Phil right now
select the brush tool and what you can do
is you can draw various
you know lines based on the color template so
I'm going to go to maybe a yellow
so let's say this is just as you go darker where you press a little bit harder
you can get a very faint line for sketching or any kind of detail or as you press harder
it gets that deeper deeper markings on the actual Photoshop as you can see
it's really accurate
this is completely wireless
I do have a ton
so you know you can sketch out whatever you want
I'm destroying general shape
you know no way but you can do anything you really want and adjust it
let's say rush
look but you can write pretty much whatever you want
great accuracy the 2048 levels of precision
whatever you really need so there you have it guys
and now let's go on to the finals section my thoughts on product itself
all right guys kind of going over the overall summary of what
I got a bunch of replacement
nibs that kind of leads me to the first issue that I kind of had with the 10 tablet
it's the the nibs that were provided depending on
how heavy heavy handed you are you do go through nibs faster than I would think right
I I do tend to write or press down a lot harder than I probably should
10 tablet is really just a nitpick has nothing to do with performance
it's this gloss edge right
fingerprints were magnetized to this section of high gloss right
I'm the type of person
i believe it's 18 hours
you can just double check
i have the link in the description but i believe it was an 18-hour specified battery life
I got closer to with usage with my normal everyday usage
I got anywhere
between eight to ten hours
instead that's from shutting it off turning it on cetera et cetera
if it's left on constantly it will drain your battery past
it's safe zone and what it will render your battery essentially useless
you have to get a replacement battery so be careful with that when you use this
just be careful with it
shut it off whenever you're not using it and you're good
you should be good to go other than that fantastic products
I personally love using this now
I find this a little bit more comfortable and ergonomic to use this versus my mouse
but there you have it guys
that's my review of the way
hey jb here excited
you're with me today
we're gonna unbox and test two things with this onyx
color device seven point inch eight inch color ink device
i've never had one
we're gonna look at the device we're gonna unbox it
this is a place for reviews
good energy all kinds of productivity tips and just fun
this is a community more than a channel
let's open it up first now
i opened up the box that it came in
this came from china from books
i wish they would put the factory screen protector on at the factory
this is i'm just not good at it
all the books products typically do that
it drives me nuts
i i doubt i'll put it on here if i keep this
i may be ebay this product by the way i did buy this
um this is a not not a spent to product review
this actually is a purchase from me
i did purchase this device
okay we have a couple screen protector accessories to get the screen on
we do have a sheet of paper from a google play
uh that's how to get the google play store on here
the books devices are as you'll hear me a lot of times they're great devices
it's just this
setup can be really tricky
i i consider this the engineers device because it's more of a left brain device
where like the remarkable 2 is more of a minimalistic or the super note
you just jump in and use it
i'm not sure
and then we have a books
typical books cover which i believe
is their little denim kind of cover
let's go ahead and open it up and take a look
the packaging is is decent as always with their products
let's see how does this open up
i don't want to destroy the box because if i don't like this it doesn't suit my needs
it is going to be going up on ebay
so let's see i just want to see what the cover is
the case is like hopefully
it's not a sticky case
let's see and it is not a nice little case
it's not bad little you clip in case
that's not bad and i
i don't know if that comes with it from amazon or not
read the description if you go over to amazon and take a look at this thing okay
so let's go ahead and open it up as you can see the box here
i want to get the initial stylus test
i did get some complaints on the ghosting from a couple of my subscribers
that have already got this and said that they didn't like the ghosting box is fine
comes out normal like the normal box
and let's see here
we go kind of a smaller device
7.8 inches okay
here it comes out of the the case and again another screen protector
and that's just a bummer
i don't like to put on screen protectors please books
please put that on the factory
i'd actually pay extra you know i bought this device
i would pay extra for that
i just think it's just a pain for some of us to put on
okay so here
it comes in a nice kind of a plastic books nova series piece of paper
let's see how this comes off again
i don't want to ruin this because i may be putting this on ebay okay
so here's the device um it looks pretty good the colors
it's a little dark
it's powered off right now
so we'll see i'm going to power it on in a minute
we're going to take a look at it but let's look at the accessories in the box
let's bring this back over and just to make a comparison just so you can see the size
it's pretty small but big and i don't have big hands
okay all right so let's look at what we got in here
we have a power cable
and that's interesting okay
so there's a charger cable
i think it's usbc
i would assume yes it is usbc and then we have the most important thing
which is the stylus and i have other styluses
i do not like book styluses
they're accessories
it's just so cheap
this thing's plastic
it just doesn't feel good
um and then yeah so
i think that's got a little hole there for this
this thing that you can put it on there
we're going to do two things
we're going to do a writing test color test
see how dark it is
um and that's where we're going to go so let me charge it up
be right back and we'll get on this okay
we are back the device is on
we are ready to go
uh i think i've been pretty good
focus okay first thoughts on the stylus
i do not like it
i think it's cheap
it feels like plastic
okay compared to the remarkable two and other styluses
this is heavy
uh this is just kind of a cheapy thing for 400 device
i wish books would do a better job
okay let's go ahead and look up here
you can kind of see the coloring in the different areas i did not put a screen protector on here
it's a little bit brighter
that is the maximum
i've heard it's been pretty dark and that is an issue that i'm seeing a little bit
now let's get into the notes so the notes i've been playing with it a little bit
the writing experience is not that great
it's a little bit glassy and i think if we end up with the screen protector
it's gonna even gonna feel more
uh than the the stylus that comes with it
um again it's pressure as you put more pressure down it comes
it's not horrible
you can kind of see that okay
so let's go ahead and erase see if that erases
um but the writing experience is okay
i don't know if it's really going to work
because as you can see i'm on eraser no wonder duh user error
um there's red you can kind of see red right and if i go
let's go a different color
let's go like um gray
i think they're close
i just don't see that's gray
i mean i can make it thicker
let's make it a little thicker
let's make it real thick here but for me
i'm not going to take thick notes right so i don't know if i really need the coloring
let's go ahead and erase all this and see
the ghosting is a problem
see that's what everybody's saying is that the ghosting's a little bit of an issue
so if you come over here and refresh the screen again
too of kind of how they're going to work
i think they're still a little way from the color
there's black let's go ahead and go with a you know red color
this is the device so i personally do not like the riding experience and then you can see it ghost
can you see that right back there
it's ghosting when i push this
it's ghosting that okay and i think what does that do does that take it back to
i don't even know what wt means so i haven't gotten the instructions again
my reviews are just right off the cuff straight out of the box again
i purchased this as far as black and white looks great
i the colors
just don't do anything for me
okay so writing
that was the first experience
i don't like the stylus
the writing experience is average at best
okay let's go into actually uh some of the seeing some of the stuff now
one of the things i do like is the web browser on
it is pretty cool so i went and grabbed a video
let's see if we can play it
let's refresh it's an advertisement on my video but you can see the ghosting
okay here i am talking so you can kind of see
it's i mean almost watchable
that's an a2
let's go into regular normal mode and we'll move it
i mean obviously
this device isn't meant for video but you can see there is
there is some stuff there and the color isn't bad
i mean it's again the ghosting you can see
it's it's just ghosting and i
i'm just not sure
oh it's on a2
let me go back to normal
i'm sorry maybe that'll help
and let's refresh this and we'll take a look at a webpage
this is my webpage and there's still ghosting on there
let me refresh the whole thing
so a lot of people want it for comics and i
i don't know what these refresh rates are
it's gonna be able to work right
it's okay like it's okay
but it's not anything spectacular like game changing and here's some books ideas
okay so let's go back
you can see a little bit of the color on some of these apps
it's kind of cool and you can kind of see some of the apps here
let's see news and you can kind of see
they got a little bit of color to them
is it the the big game changer that i thought it would be
it's just do you want to spend the extra money on this device
um when it
you can kind of see the coloring
i mean it's it's it's decent
i i think this is a little too small anyways to be my primary note taker
um but they're getting there
i think coleto like three
this is coleto
i think
2.5 i think they just need to keep working on it
it's close the writing
experience is not horrible
um it's just not great
it's it's fast and again when i take that and put that on now
i've got a little bit of ghosting there so if i want to go gray you know it's it's okay again
nothing great all right so i just wanted to do this
something i would use probably not would i use it as a reader
i'm gonna try it but i think the ghosting's gonna drive me absolutely crazy
i might use it for some comment comics but even then
i don't think i'd use it
i'd stay with my kobo because it's just easier so again
this is just like a regular review of me
will i use this thing
i don't know i'm gonna give it and i bought it
i'm gonna give it a week or two right now
looks like it's going on ebay
that's my rating of it
and if you've got some comments down below if you're saying hey jb no
you're doing something wrong
let me know but even in all the different modes
the ghosting is not that great
so if i'm trying to read something in color it's going to be hard
i'm going to have to keep refreshing
what do you want me to test on this
is there something you would like to know
is there a specific thing that you need for me
this is a community more than a channel as i always say let me down below and know down below you
this is Lisa from mobile tech review
and this is the Lenovo ThinkPad tablet
this is an Android 3.1 honeycomb tablets 10.1 inches and this
Lenovo is more professional
version of tablet we've looked at the Lenovo IdeaPad k1 which is their consumer oriented one
right here feels nice
grippy does shows some fingerprints but not too bad
obviously not a super thin tablet
and here we've got the optional pin though it has a built-in silo for the pen
Lenovo tablets
I think that guy out like so now
this is an active digitizer pen
used as an entry duo sense display on the device
which means that
this pen is not a capacitive
I don't like that and it's also much more precise than even using a capacitive
stylus the front is a little different most
Android Honeycomb tablets
don't have any buttons
the operating system is designed not to use buttons
when avos ad at home back a web browser launcher under rotation lock button here
there actually sometimes a little bit annoying
but they're not that easy to press accidentally but I don't see a need for them
maybe you'll like them on the side here
we have a little door that drops down some things recover the doors
some aren't go figure
generally speaking slots are covered here
there's a SIM card slot
there's actually a carrier
next to it and we have a micro USB port HDMI ports a mini HDMI port
headphone Jack nothing up here
except for your power button volume controls are over here and on the bottom
there's a sliding door here
for some reason it covers the full-size USB port with USB host
that means you can use keyboards
mice flash drives we plugged in an unpowered
USB hard drive and it spun it up
there's no problem getting enough power to it but it actually did not mount it and see it bummer
this will also connect to the Lenovo ThinkPad optional keyboard
that we're going to show you in a bit that sells for $100
you know
NVIDIA Tegra 2 dual-core CPU with a gig of ram
this guy is more stable
we do notice occasional slowdowns when using them
you can see we've got
Lenovo zone app shop over here
this is a quick launcher and because there's so much software on here
you can configure what you want each of these to do
because there's many options if you hit watch defaults to em spot video service it also 18
T uses for video rentals and downloads
but you can choose to assign gallery to that or something else
least they have different icons to give you a clue
the built-in gallery application does a better job playing
obviously your email and web browser in the middle we've got
McAfee security loaded here
not sure that's really necessary but since
Lenovo is trying to sell this
that kind of stuff is here
all this utility does is let you copy
say if you've got movies or something like that so that's good
it's not limited like the Sony Tablet
isn't that respect so here
I wouldn't call this the most beautiful or intuitive interface
and all this going to do is copy
USB if you plug this in using the micro USB cable to your computer it will charge
it's a trickle charge
it's very slow
they say you should turn the display off if you wanted to charge
supports both
the three point to a little bit of a bummer there
scrolling is just fine so we have pre loading here
it's a little bit quirky
sometimes no probably going to want to use something like Aldi CO or cool reader or
look if you want to sideload books lenovo likes card games
so we've got a bunch of card games pre-loaded over here hearts solitaire
spades euchre and mention em spot videos load if you want to rent videos
uh their prices tend me a little bit higher than average
but that's okay
slacker is pre-installed their social touch social networking which is basic social networking
it's probably a bit more
Universal in reliable as I mentioned we've got Zinio onboard as well and a copy of the user guide
one thing about the
because you've got this really big screen here so we've got Netflix loaded
typical of Netflix is going to buffer up a little bit and then it's going to play shortly
that plays great
of course this is over
Wi-Fi since that's all we have looking good so you got Netflix on the go with this
the tablet weighs one point six pounds
so this is no lightweight this is no iPad 2 or Samsung Galaxy 10.1 and hand-making
a little tired holding
I mean that's not so different from the EPI transformer which is 1.5 pounds or the Motorola Xoom
the display is brighter on the ThinkPad version as it should be since it's IPS
also has much wider viewing angles and in terms of thickness they're both pretty thick
there's a bit more taper going on with the IdeaPad and it's got that kind of gritty
which has as you can see it even brighter display it also has much better speakers
Lenovo speakers and that's a good terms of size
Lenovo is a little bit bigger overall and obviously in terms of thickness because Galaxy
Tab is so darn thin it's lots thicker
suite comes with documents to go and this can view edit and create office documents
and here's your splash screen right here
it's fully tablet
HD or wear
and if you want to create a new document you just hit the plus button down here and choose between
Word Excel or PowerPoint document
and you get a very basic interface at first with keyboard deployed
so we're going to take a look at some of your editing options here and you can see
here's your file
menu edit view format insert and more
so say you want to edit
are you going to toggle keyboard
select select all copy paste undo redo that kind of stuff so a fairly basic interface
but it definitely gets the job done and it's fairly compatible speaking of editing documents
Lenovo has a really cool accessory
there's the USB port
Lenovo's to make knows how to make keyboards really really good keyboard
we've gotten it slid into the mountain and you can see here
it has those ridges typical of the field folio cases and you can choose which incline you want
you've got three positions and it's firmly in placing now
you've got your your laptop substitute to go on the road again
really excellent keyboard
you've got a dedicated number over here and a bunch of Android functions
well now we've got the a seuss
ipad transformer here with the keyboard dock in it
this still one of the lenovo because this is one sturdy laptop like guy once
you've attached a laptop dock
it acts just like standard notebook computer
that could make a larger keyboard and welcome both side by side now now
we compare the two keyboards as you can see the
Lenovo keys are a little bit bigger
they also have more travel and just more tactile feedback
CSUN that's a half cap of the screen twice
I'm not sure of this because of the enteric digitizer
that's on here or if it's a little bit slow to respond the HEC Jetstream also uses the entering
this is not horrible but once in a while it will it happens
we're going to take a look at the web browser
now you can see
so if you're looking for YouTube content that's also a very good way to play YouTube stuff
that's playing 360p inside the browser
it's a pretty large phone
it's a 4.3
inch display which is the same as age
we'll switch to full screen
that's not bad
performance is a couple of frame drops
60 online packs multi thread tests and about 32 on the single thread test
so it's pretty much average among honeycomb tablets
tablets won't even let you try to play 1080p
high profile standard profile and peg 4 is a lot
this one will let you do it but the frame rates are not so good
we have a 1080p high profile
we've complained some about the software the excessive amount of software
I think one of those reason other than the usual
hey everybody likes to make some money is
this is a more secure and vetted place and since this is geared towards corporate users
you know there's a place you can go where the applications have been checked out no
subsets rather what you can find on the Android Market
but then there's enough here to look at and keep you busy for those of you
who have watched our HTC jet stream Android tablet review
Express for tablets installed here
and there's a sketchbook pro that supports pressure sensitivity with this tablet
but did you just say that one color and you can see it
works very fluidly no skipping nothing like you see with capacitive styli
PDFs there's not too much beyond notes mobile but not small
I've already done here before
and this is the font that it uses after his recognised stuff and you can see
you can select a word if you want
but we're just going to write something in cursive and he actually got that right
if you print you get better accuracy
yeah honestly overall accuracy on this is about 70%
I don't have great handwriting
it is and does a nice job making your handwriting
look a little prettier than it really is
jetstream have a two button
stylus that does two different things
you can erase there
which is average among android 10.1 inch honeycomb tablets and it's 30 250 milliamp battery
that's sealed inside the unit perfectly capable playing game since it's your standard
Nvidia 1 gigahertz dual-core CPU with graphics acceleration as well
even if lenovo's not thinking about gaming you can whenever you got some downtime
so that's the Lenovo ThinkPad tablet running Android with a 10.1 inch IPS
I'm pricing for that though
I even announced that again
I'm Lisa from mobile tech review
visit our website for the full review
hello today and welcome back to my channel
this is hack the planet today
I'm bringing you the RCA cambio two-in-one Windows 10 tablet
this runs full window so you can run old applications all the way back to the 90s even DOS
apps can run with software that you can find that will allow you compatibility like DOS blog
you're gonna find cheap plastic here
the screen of course is plastic
I'm sure they're gonna receive the same hardware refresh as well this device
you can pick it up for 120 regular price not on sale
should you get it or not
my recommendation is no on this one
really you know that the bilk want to show you the back of this thing
I mean any device with a reset button is one that I just
I do not recommend the camera is I
don't know if you can see it but it's not centered properly
the volume buttons are here
this is a reset button on the side of this device
there you go
you can't find any other deals
maybe this is for you
it does have a full-size
HDMI that's a good
that's a plus
you can have it behind a cabinet and you know it's just
the you know at the bottom of the barrel
I'm sure you've seen that
before on a cheapo device either textures are off for the game fails to load
that's because some of the instructions that you need are not included with those cheapo
Android devices you will not have this problem here
this does support
which by the way is not that bad anymore
you can actually run 3d games now on even the cheapest full-size hardware like that
you find in a laptop or like a mini desktop computer
but this thing is optimized to run high-definition videos
you shouldn't have any problem there
it sports a 2 2 megapixel cameras and they're of questionable quality
the screen actually looks great
it's the plastic screen
I mean you know you don't get a glass screen on a laptop so you can take it or leave it
the screen protector is still on this device right now
it does have a 1200 by 800 display
that has the basic
it does not come with office with an office license
you will have to pay for office with this
it says on the box that because the word mobile Excel mobile
the lights are dim
the keyboard is not a full-size keyboard
the buttons are square
let's take a look at those
if you can like and get it right you can see underneath the jeez
it's not a really well-built keyboard
but it is definitely a 10 inch
RCA computer I never thought I'd see a RCA PC
because technically these are pcs in the tablet form factor
they will run all and tell me right there on the box and tell inside never thought
I'm actually going to swap it out for a
I just picked up a Black Friday sale on a Dell laptop
you know a mobile
I know they're coming up pretty soon especially but thanks again for watching my channel
please like share subscribe
this is hack the planet have a great rest of your day
so let's get this one unboxed
let's get this [ __ ] out of here
oh my god it's so big
ah i am so not doing that
right jesus christ
maybe i should have done this on the floor
thank god i appreciate that okay
let's see what i broke all right so this is the stand
actually this one looks smaller so and this one actually fits
i might use it
aha this time
i didn't forget about the cleaning cloth i'm gonna keep it here all right the sand
let's see what we have here
okay so this one is different than the stand i had for the last one i mean
obviously they want it to be bigger and sturdier
so we're gonna have to peel this one
it's gonna be very satisfying
yeah okay
so the tablet is supposedly 22 inches or maybe 21.5
i think i'm gonna measure it later
it comes with this stand the manual
the driver manual almost like the driverless
you have your usbs and ah what's this thing
you got your pen your brand new pen which looks exactly like the previous huion
you also got your little donut holder your little poke ball
oh god i'm going to build stuff
help me and a bunch of screws
oh okay for the um the stand all right
what i like what i don't like as much and some of the specification to help you
if you are looking for a new drawing tablet as i know some of you are okay here
we go the canvas
22 plus is actually 21.5 inches
but it feels huge to me
i can fit two and a third of my cintiq's 13 in it
i'm not sure if i'm too comfortable
i'm probably just too used to my 13 inch screen that
it can become the engine of the pen display
that's cool and it's windows
it has chemically etched ag glass for visual performance
which is anti-glare giving it this realistic pen on paper experience when you draw on it
the screen also has less cursor offset than other tablets which is worth mentioning
thanks to the anti-glare finish
there's no house light reflecting in it while you try to walk
which is great
the pen is enhanced with appendix 3.0
it has buttons on the side and no eraser so keep that in
mind if you like to use the eraser a lot on your tablet pen i like the nib a lot
it feels very secure
it doesn't wobble around at all but also isn't too stiff very sturdy
the performance of the pen seems good
i haven't understanding
major delays in the strokes
this is excellent and definitely one of my favorite things about it
a lot of tablet stands tend to wiggle on lower angles
but this one keeps the tablet sturdy no matter how high or low of an angle you walk on now
let's get some drawing done
according to the site these are the programs
since this tablet came with a graph that actually fits me for the first time in my life
i tried walking with it okay
let's go turns out walking with a glove on isn't really my cup of coffee
i wasn't feeling how slightly it made my hand
go over the screen
this is probably just a me problem though since
i've ever owned yes even my 12 year old wacom intuos one which is a drawing tablet not a screen
one had shortcut buttons or express keys on the side
the canvas 22 plus doesn't have any shortcut buttons
because it's only there to mock you if you do want this tablet but like shortcut buttons
you can try and bypass this issue by having one of the pen buttons be the shortcut button instead
that's what i did
the problem is when you do that
the colors aren't as accurate anymore
i can't complain about the colors
i'm sure there's a way to recalibrate these beautiful colors once you lower the brightness
i just didn't want to mess around with the settings too much at this stage
also here's something that's just weird for some reason
unlike the canvas pro 16 this special graph is very adjustable which is nice
you can play around with the pressure level to your liking
i'm basic so i don't mess around with it too much in conclusion
the huion canvas 22 plus is a very decent tablet aside from the absence of shortcut buttons
i have no major complaints about it
i think it's good if i'll get used to its size
i may as well keep it as my main tablet who knows
hope you liked this little review
thank you all so very much for watching
see you on the next video
stay spooky
my pretty darlings bye bye
hello everyone in today's video
I'm going to review the Pablo is 6
temporal graphic drawing tablet
that was sent over to me from
Pablo the official retail price is us $79.99
the main selling features it physical chaka buttons
aspera will append
let's take a look at what's included
that's the warranty information
this tablet comes with a one-year warranty by the way if you are using any
we have a big piece of microfiber cleaning cloth and one artist glove
that's inside this zip back
USB data cable the pen blue quality is solid
feels really nice
this is a matte surface
hot rubber grip two side buttons
the pen tip now
this pen is not powered by batteries
so it doesn't require any charging there are is no you razor at the back overall
it feels really comfortable to hope
and this is the pen
stand that you can use to rest the pen
horizontally or vertically the remover built into the back of the stand
this is not a wireless tablet
the cable actually goes here and as you can see this tablet
it's really thin on the back
we have matte surface for rubber feet
the big 40 is very solid
the design looks very clean and simple
it's not too rough and not too smooth
Windows driver version
one point six point one
I have also tested the tablet on Mac OS with driver version
is this extra Windows Inc functionality
here so here
we can assign shortcuts to to set buttons on the pen
the pressure curve can be adjusted manually by moving this dot
this allows you find a control over the pressure curve and you can test a pen pressure
Mouse functions mouse clicks to the buttons
you can assign specific keyboard shortcuts by just pressing the keys or you can choose one of this
I have only assigned two so to switch between all these functions
I just put no action and now let's talk about growing performance
drum performance is excellent on both Windows and Mac OS
I have tested Photoshop
Illustrator affinity photo affinity designer clip studio paint
Pro really bang paint and creat
are they all work really
they taper really nicely
I can maintain consistent pressure very easily so the thickness for the lines
they don't wobble basically the lines
they always come out just the way
I expect them to the performance
it's very predictable and I can press down
hot and tablet
basically tap on a tablet to create dots like this
Photoshop a Mac is a lot more responsive compared to Photoshop on Windows
this is my two-year-old girl
Tiffany sleeping on her it
this is photoshop on
it's also not as smooth
another issue with photoshop is pressure
sensitivity doesn't work by default
so you actually have to turn on
they are very responsive so
I don't have issues with the other apps black clip studio paint MIDI Bang affinity Krita
the pennant does not support sensitivity
I'm only talking about it because I saw this on the box
I am wrong maybe there is to test sensitivity
there's no need to buy this
Pablo tablet so
the build quality is solid and the drawing performance is fantastic on both Mac and Windows
we've all the various drawing apps that
I have tested except for Photoshop on Windows
where there is this lack where it's less than responsive anyway
it's always photoshop on windows
that has black so we need outside of this tablet is when you are working with
Pablo is 610
Pro works perfectly on Windows and Mac OS but less than ideal with Android
alright thanks for watching if you have any questions
let me know in the comment section below
I hope this video is helpful
see you in the next video I
this video is sponsored by xp pen who are having their 15th anniversary right now to celebrate
they're having a discount of 30 off all of the products on their webstore until september 15th
the first type of tablet i ever used was a tablet without a screen that basically just means that
these are always a more affordable option than the more fancy screen option
and i find that they're actually quite enjoyable to use
you can get really comfortable with them and leave them in your lap and i like that
they come in a lot of different sizes whereas screen tablets tend to be on the larger side
now this works as a second monitor on your computer and you draw directly onto the screen
fortunately though this tablet saved the day and works just perfectly on catalina
so if you are a mac user you don't have to worry about that
this is called the innovator 16.
it is xp pens 15.6 inch screen drawing tablet and
it's become my main drawing tablet ever since i got it
once you do that
i love buttons on my tablet whether they're screened or non-screen
there's a setting for that in the this little menu so if you want to use it vertically
that's totally fine which i think is really cool
not every tablet
i've used has had that though so if that's something you're really interested in
i recommend this model
i've actually never seen that on any other tablet
do not and making sure that it's at a bit of an angle off your desk
i'd recommend when you get your tablet is to try and look up some information on how to clean it
they're very pressure sensitive and whatnot
so if you like put anything sharp on it or leave heavy things on it
you can damage the components
that's why my very first tablet looks absolutely like brutalized
it's all like scratched up and uh that also can happen when you don't change your nib enough
uh keep in sort of like checking in on your pen every month or so
make sure
it's not like whittling down to a sharp point
i want to talk more about the innovator 16.
this tablet is kind of my dream tablet in a lot of ways
i was impressed with the fact that it came with a stand and a smudge guard
the stand is really important because with a tablet that's relatively large
um it also comes with a protective little case for your pen
it's really frustrating
i find and also the battery is going to make it a lot heavier
which if you're drawing for hours and hours on end that's really not ideal
you're going to notice that weight difference
it has nibs in the bottom which is really important
there were a lot of bonus goodies like these little stickers
please leave them in the comments
and i'm going to try to answer as many as i can when this video releases
thank you so much for watching

hello every Dolby
living eletronic reviewed items
I'll be reviewing a spy
ASIS the name of this tablet is called zenpad
10 model number is Z 3 0 1
M and it's an Android tablet now this Andrew
now he's a 10-inch tablet as you can see at the bottom
he also takes a micro
SD memory card
okay and that can be it can go up to 128 gig
he can take at the top
that's the power button and on the left side it has the perm the volume buttons
I also takes a three point five
millimeters Jack Poe and it has a USB type-c charge impossible at the back
he has a five megapixel camera and the logos
there as you can see and at the front he has a two megapixel camera
okay so it does have a decent cameras
okay but for tablet doesn't really need a lion or very good quality tablet cameras
the speak is out the front
he has a dual speakers
and it's at the front as you can see this bit here
that's where the speakers are
it's designed with sleek metallic edge and imposed a mere patent in his book
as you can see at the back okay got that qualities
whoa it has a rich display as well okay incorporating
I'm software between Wi-Fi only doesn't totally take em a member a SIM card
basically now as you can see is very smooth virtually
I'm operating this okay
so for example
let me say go to that
everything is touch sensitive
if you go to saying there's you can see
he loads up very quickly as well
he has a break
just don't think gig go in to use okay
the battery life is very good my opinion okay
okay if he's a constant news if he's a now in the news you could lost at least two days
he also has a boo in
Zen motion
okay so they gives you some touch distance stuff like that he has of a few aces customizing
I'm sayings Asus
you will have only the kids mode and Mickey controller the way you want it
it also has screens your backup settings if you go on about it shows you 7.0
model numbers p 0 to 8
but actually it says ed 3:01 am best actual one okay so if you are interested in one of these
and a case
thank you for watching my video
please do give a like and subscribe
i've seen your comments your requests
will you all have been asking me for
i know what you want a successor
a new iteration and a series of mine
your words have not fallen on deaf
ears friends i am proud to announce that finally after so long
uh xp pen has recently gotten in contact with me asking me to review the new innovator 16.
i've been a bit hesitant to do
any further tablet review videos
let's get right into it
so the innovator 16 is a 15.6 inch tablet so it's a medium sized one and inside the box
we got the tablet itself
we've got the pen
we've got the stand a drawing glove
we got the three in one adapter connector as well as several power connectors in case
you're like in the eu or whatnot
the instruction booklet as well as a microfiber cloth which i actually appreciate because cleaning
a tablet is kind of a pain
the overall build quality of the tablet feels incredibly solid
almost a little on the heavy side
but that's not a bad thing necessarily the stand itself as usual
it's a little bit lightweight
kind of feels a little flimsy
however the rubber grips on it are very very solid
i never actually had any issue with the tablet stand from before
the tablet itself is as i said a 15.6 inch drawing space
it's only about nine millimeters thick
it has a screen protector
the pen itself is also interesting
i didn't like it but this one
wires would have to go down
the other way causes the wires to go right onto the desk which well that works
it's a little bit annoying to deal with
it's not the worst in the world
i mean you can deal with it
if your tablet's positioned on the left side of you rather than the right side
it would probably be fine but it could lead to a little bit of messy wire management
the screen quality in the visuals is actually a step up from my last model
this is right at 92 adobe rgb with an 88 ntsc and 125 srgb in layman's terms
that means that it's a very accurate color space
this is a small step up from my previous xp pen
model the artist pro 13.3
i didn't have to adjust anything with my previous model
i had to fiddle with it a lot
the drivers are all familiar
there's a little bit more traction on the screen protector
it doesn't feel papery so much maybe slightly more plasticky
it's a little hard to describe
it's a little soft but it's not unpleasant
fortunately don't have that here
it has a very soft grip
that's very pleasant to hold
is that my tablet for some reason will seem to lag in csp at random
so is this a good buy
the innovator display 16 is currently valued at 500 on the official xp pen store
this is a worthy consideration
that does it for this review
oh and the art of the background is of mumiji from touhou
hopefully that'll change soon
but i did finish chapter 8 of my webcomic
recently if you want to go read that there's a link in the description anyway
i'm bad at ending videos
which is about standard for every single youtuber on the site so bye
hello everyone so today
I'm reviewing for this
it's bigger screen
it doesn't take a long time to load apps like that one did the only thing
I probably don't like about this tablet
so you had to pay five bucks for a week or 30 bucks for the year which
I think it's kind of unfair when you're paying $50 more for it
so is there any more expensive tablet and yet to pay for the apps versus the PBS apps
we're all free so the tablet itself
was really glitchy just crash and spaz on you thank you
this is nicer from mobile tech review
and this is the
Motorola design board
8.2 it's available now on
Verizon it's an LTE honeycomb tablet that measures 8.2 inch of the kind of unique size
we're gonna take a look at it now so this is the Motorola Zhai board 8.2
which means you get a full 1280 by 800 pixels on display
just as you would with a 10-inch tablet from a looks perspective
it's unique it's interesting
it's kind of macho and reddish because well it is a
Droid tablet and it looks just like the 10.1
Zhai board only well at 8.2 inches
if we take a look at the sides you can see if got a rubbery coating here feels durable
there's your speaker hole
here's your micro
USB port your micro HDMI port and this is where your SIM card slot is right here
take some micro sim just like this
I'm bored 10.1
nothing at all
just nice pretty curves but if you look at the back uh-huh you know
Motorola likes to put their controls and interesting places
this is your power button and easier volume controls
now what does iboard 10.1
they put them on the side on the edge
and you've got the back panel here
aluminum very stiff very rugged
Torx screws there's like t1 or t2
Torx screws and they actually are real screws
they're not just visual rivets or something like that
I unscrewed them
and there are no screws whatsoever no
God knows how you take this apart
on the 10.1
together you can see the size difference so kind of a just right size if you're
Goldilocks right sometimes
the 7 inch tablet is just maybe a little bit too small here we have the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 plus
obviously it's not as portable
well there's the 8.2 for you
so let's take a look at the specs of the zai board this runs
Android OS 3.2 honeycomb expected one good upgrade to Ice Cream Sandwich motorola
nothing customized there no integrated motoblur or social networking
anything like that you know it has the 8.2 inch display running at 1280 by 800 resolution
and that means that things are
I conjure a little bit smaller text
say on your settings menu is going to be a little bit teeny err but it's still viewable
let's see right here
the words are fairly small
this has a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core TI OMAP CPU
that seems to be the favorite for for
Ice Cream Sandwich and for tablets right now and even some smart phones like the Galaxy
Nexus runs on that CPU
it does pretty well in bench just at the 10.1
not quite as fast as a 10.1
perhaps they're not pushing
this is aggressively given the relatively small casing and the smaller battery inside
that's one of the big differences between this and those iboard 10.1
this is a four thousand milliamp battery
that's not a bad capacity
and we're seeing it run between five and six hours on a charge and that depends whether using
so you're obviously gonna get longer run times with the bigger xiphoid 10.1
says a gig of ram
it's a double either 16 or 32 gig storage capacities through isn't a micro
SD card slot does support USB host
and here we have the the old motorola
Motorola you plug something in sound
we'll take a look at our file manager here and see what we see
so we've got our flash drive mounted
I'm using Android explorer
no skip ahead to some a little bit more exciting so I was playing just fine off the flash drive
you can get that for like half price
so you can see how it plays high profile 1080p content plays perfectly
well correct if
I don't want to play 1080p to the internal display because it doesn't support that resolution
you're just going to scale down but it does have that micro
8.2 does pretty relic is a 2822 on quadrant 56 on lynn packs multi thread test
five five five five on on two two and SunSpider a very good result 1807
that's this not quite as fast as a board 10.1 but again you know
we saw more like 22 or so for download speeds and about 6 up when we had say negative 85
it comes with or without a verizon contract
has they have zoom to and the zoom to Home Media Edition for the smaller guy
the zoom was never cheap
Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1
you get the idea in terms of what's different between this and the zai board 10.1
10.1 has longer battery life
Zhai board and the other important difference is the active digitizer
this design board
10.1 comes with an active digitizer
and that means it's like a Windows tablet
it supports both capacitive multi-touch and an active pen
not a capacitive teton in fact
here's the pen from the 10.1
and you can see
so if you're looking forward to note-taking drawing that kind of stuff you want the 10.1
and not the 8.2 software bundles also a little bit different
we'll take a look at that
now that some of those things can be downloaded here
which isn't here now something like the Citrix client you can download using the moto
you can view photos all that kind of stuff and you can just grab files
use that moto cast
I find it kind of sluggish and well
I think the Moto Kass USB is a better option especially for those of you want to sync with iTunes
really fun game
that's golf 2
seems to be pretty inescapable these days but also very popular
Evernote's bundled and so is Skitch Evernote
it's pretty popular cloud notes syncing application and sketches for the drawing part
it's funny that sketches
bundle in this since it doesn't actually have the active digitizer for pen use
but hey you can use your finger and draw or capacitive stylus too for that kind of thing
we've got the usual
Verizon data counter widget
that's the only custom widget on the device
which is pretty handy to keep track of
how much data you use
we've got it
we've also got
PowerPoint this this is the most full-featured version
you're plenty of options
let me just pick the video off the front page
that's included called digit
and those of you who used
iOS devices might be familiar with digit because they make a similar application that controls
it's showing what's on and you can choose your cable
TV provider satellite over-the-air that kind of stuff and you can also set location
you see right here
we have guide verses devices now
this is what the controller grid looks like
they support quite a few brands of AV gear equipment
that'll check out the web browser
video review
let's see how to
W flash plays because plane is fine
I'll pop it out to fullscreen 480p like most of all Android tablets as I
board has dual cameras as a 1.3 megapixel camera on the front works with Skype and Google
Talk video chat among other things and a 5 megapixel rear camera
LT reception this is decent
tablets are generally pretty good
we find those eye board
10.1 does have better stronger reception though more room for an antenna
certainly can help with that
if you're trying to decide between the two and the size either one is going to work for you
I would recommend the larger and 10.1
not just because it's bigger
they both feel reasonably fast
not super look at you
Verizon it's Motorola second generation honeycomb tablet will get Ice Cream Sandwich at some point
I'm Lisa from mobile tech review
visit our website for the full review
and don't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel
seems to work
oh yeah yeah again
it's kind of a long story you know
I didn't know just no I didn't exactly play my cards right cards
yeah it's open
come in please thank you help me my Asian Santa and like he
he has a present for you come in Santa
Oh [ __ ] I didn't order anything Santa not Amazon Prime
I I didn't it's not even like Christmas it's like December like 10th or something on Christmas
you freaking idiot if Miami asked you know what it is
it's that drying towel you've been asking for you
but also for you know a free new kick-ass tablet so uh in other words we sponsored boys
sorry he wanna know you sent me
dis like almost two months ago please
don't you know do me like that one poison
it actually has a pretty sweet rubber grip and I'm pretty glossy finish that combined
what a fine tip is actually kind of kind of pretty heavy and godsend
when you open the package you'll see it comes with extra nibs along with the tablet itself
USBC card these fancy adapters for something
really cool the directions was links to drivers to download and a neat little carrying case that
I've never had before in my life
Wacom Intuos the nibs were in the tablet but I like this much much more now
this tablet has 11 different buttons
you can map on the settings for the tablet for instance my left is undo in
my right is redo while
I've set my bottom is saved and my up is transform as usual
[ __ ]
I can use this feature to write funny harmless little messages
see easy peasy
there is a pretty neat hue on up
I have the black one which they would have to be the red one but you know
beggars can't be choosers
I generally really like this tablet
I was pretty on it in early 2019 as you can see from here
I've decided to try and draw something
I haven't done a self-portrait in a hot minute so forgive me that it's that is so simple
a lot of people say that my art is good except that
it was kind of stupid too again
I guess that shows how negligent I am ah haha
hello everyone in this video
i'll be reviewing this gmac
m70 kids android tablet now
this tablet is affordable
now the case is designed in a way where it's very thick even you can see the corners of it
so it's pretty useful
now bear in mind
this is a budget price tablet
so you can't really expect much from this you can see the build
quality is not the best and it feels very cheap
he's a seven inch tablet and it does have a rear camera
it does have a front camera
doesn't have no flash
it has a speaker on the bottom left corner
speaker is not the best the quality as well
um it squeaks a lot here it takes a 3.5 millimeters headphone jack
it also takes a micro sd memory card and the charging port is here on this side
it has the volume button and the power button
and that's about it so this is everything he has
so i've switched here on so i can show you some some features that he has built in mainly kids
so it does have a lot of pre-installed kids apps so when you have started up
i've skipped the registration i went directly to the main menu
so i can show you how much memory it still has built in now without going
um to the settings
i'm going to show you some apps that's already in pre-built in for kids now
for example draw it has draw built in and then you've got uh that's another kids app
that's pretty installed little pianist
um spin guess learning animals so it does have a few
it shouldn't be that bad now
it's already used up around five gigs
so our 16 gig five gig is already used up so 30 of it is used up
you still got the remaining demand for but for kids
you only have to download a few games etc learning gaps
it's a tablet that um operates quite um quite slowly and it can be quite frustrating
you have all that control there
also it has the opera android 10 operating system 2 gig ram and 16 gig internal memory
so that's everything it has built in but for the price range i would say is worth it
it's slightly slow but other than that
it's a tablet that's worth i'm going for
so thank you for watching my video
please do give a like and subscribe
hey everybody it's lavender town and today
this is one of the most inexpensive drawing tablets you can find
which you don't usually see it also comes with the drivers on a disc and a cord to plug it in
but not much else
it doesn't have an eraser and it's extremely small
which are the primary issues with this little tablet for the value
I wouldn't pay much more than that
the look and design gets a four out of five as well
this next one is the first
Wacom tablet that
I'm going to be showing
this is an older model of bamboo
and it's an entry level tablet from a few years ago
it has two programmable buttons but no eraser and it basically just works as a travel tablet
there's a little loop on the side to hold your pen and it has electric green accents
I got it for Christmas when I was 15 years old
it was $300 when my family first got it for me but now the price that you can get it for it varies
it's pretty much impossible to find one
that's not used now though
I was able to find a few on eBay
the design gets a 5 out of 5 because of all the buttons the touch wheel
and the fact there's two ports for you to plug in your tablet
the touch wheel is honestly a game changer and I miss it on every tablet
that doesn't have one
and lastly the field gets a 5 out of 5
it has really good pen pressure
and it's just a joy to draw on
my first impression of it was that it's very light and it has this very nice color on the back
I quite like the accent
color of that seafoam green
it's a pretty small tablet and it has the same little fabric
there's a power button on it
which basically means you don't have to have it plugged into your computer at all times
it'll allow you to get a lot more comfortable and not have to worry about getting tangled in wires
I also like that
they changed the little charging cord to an L shape
it's kind of a small detail
but it's those things that really stick with you when you use something a lot
this tablet cost $200 which i think is a very good value of five out of five for sure
the design is really cute and I quite like the new buttons
they have their super clicky and satisfying
I think the feel is the best part
it just works perfectly
it's super light and you can get as comfortable as you want with it
because it's wireless so that gets a 5 out of 5 next up is the Wacom Cintiq pro now
Wacom also sent me this one and so I also waited to unbox it until I could make this video now
it is a 13-inch
Cintiq Pro and the first thing that I noticed is that is very light now
I had a lot of fun on peeling the plastic off of all these little cords
it's really nice that they had something to consolidate them
because yeah it's a lot of cords one of the big things
I noticed with this Cintiq
the bottom of this weighted pen holder is made out of metal and
I really really like having stuff like that things that are not all plastic II
it's definitely a 5 out of 5 on the value scale
I'm also giving it full points on feel and design
I got this as a gift from my parents
thank you so much to them
but yeah that mushy stuff aside
this is a very very interesting tablet so there are screen tablets
it costs about $1,500
I believe to purchase but now because only refurbished models are available
you can find it for around half that price overall
this tablet works really well
its an asymmetrical design which means you have to flip it with the camera upside down
if you are lefty it runs its fans at full speed almost all the time which can be quite noisy
and lastly it's pretty heavy to look around based on its original price
I'd give the value a 3 out of 5
it's still very responsive
this one was originally going to be a much earlier entry
it's the CV 720 ug tablet
it was sent to me when my channel was first really getting started unfortunately
I don't think that it works anymore
it gave me some trouble with the chargeable pen
I hope you guys enjoyed it and I hope that
you'll probably just stop drawing on it really quickly so if you have any questions that you think
I can answer
hello girls and guys
this is the tech tip guy and today
I wanted to make a quick video
may be covering some loopholes and talking about some things about the next book
8-inch dual core tablet that
I feel like I didn't answer in the first video now
I've had a few viewers leave some comments and I want to try to do my best to cover or to answer
it's dual core number two
it's got an excellent screen and number you know for a budget tablet and number three
it comes with a front facing and a rear facing camera the front facing camera
you do a lot of video chatting though the front facing camera is I believe it is a point
two megapixel point eight megapixel
I cannot remember I believe I said in my first video
those are the rear facing is 1.3 megapixel
I do remember that much another viewer and also commented and said that I they must
have you know they felt like
I didn't do the tablet justice enough
but they had said that you know the tablet is great
they had not had a problem with it
they are going to buy four more their family members
and and that's great it it is
it's a great budget tablet
even you know
Windows tablets
this is not what that is this
is you know a budget tablet
Bureau had said that that most of the apps are they had not had a problem with any of the apps
working on this tablet
well you know that man let me let me say before
I get started
not all apps are going to work on any device
I realize that but to answer that our to respond to that viewers respond of their comment
I have noticed there is a popular game fan
it is a popper it's called dots and I don't know if you're familiar with it
another little thing with this tablet is that
I'm holding a camera right now
I can't really show you that
but the back on the device is sort of thin and also this device
I've noticed using it tends to get hot
the battery gets hot
and sometimes it can get almost as hot as an easy-bake oven sometimes so
I don't know if that's true for just budget
you know some of the budget tablets are all anyone
all budget tabs are all tablets rather also another little pet peeve with this and
I do not know if it will do it or not
also the live wallpaper would go back to the factory stock wallpaper and also I use SwiftKey
it is a third-party keyboard and also it would result back to the stock keyboard
I'm going to try to power it off
I can't promise it'll do it
this is the second one
I wouldn't even turn the thing off
I'm using I had another viewer also asked how do you change the boot animation on this device
so that's that's a good thing guys girls guys and I'll see if I can get in
bring up the keyboard
I would say for $99 you are really getting a lot for your money
oh I know what I was going to cover fellas
well the customer representative had sent back an email to me saying that they had no future
I they are
they had no
they didn't plan on supporting this tablet
there would be no software updates for this tablet so
I don't know who to believe
the customer representative they or the website
I have no idea
so it has that option to update the software on this tablet
but who knows but back to for your money guys
you're getting a really great tablet far as budget tablets and I can't I can
it will more than manage to do that for you
check your emails
this device is great for that and I personally say I don't think you can go wrong
buying this device guys to spend another tech tip video brought you another tech tip guy
I want to thank you for watching my video today
if you don't mind could you please rate my video and fellas
I really appreciate you stopping by
I hope to see you next time
see you later
hi i'm vicki
and today i'm going to be sharing my review of the amazon fire hd 8 kids edition tablet
we got two of these tablets for each of my girls so one of them is six and the other one is four
they were given to them as a christmas present by us
um i've been wanting to do it for quite some time
previously they'd had some leapfrog leap pad um tablets
it's obviously much cheaper than an amazon fire
kids edition tablet
because i think the game still had quite a lot to them
but i sort of wanted to broaden their horizons with like more of a more of a grown-ups tablet
i suppose more of a more of a big kid tablet
grown-ups tablet is the wrong word
big kid tablet now
um i didn't want to get the kids ipads because ipads are crazy expensive
and i i just feel like for a kid's tablet a kid's first tablet
i recommend you keep an eye out for things like black
i think is really really reasonable
so when you first get your amazon kids tablet you set up a profile for your child
i had both tablets set up
how old are they um and then added in the family sort of wi-fi password
kids tablet is this access to kids plus amazon kids plus so amazon kids
plus you get free access to for one year with the purchase of the tablet
and because you've set your child's age amazon is only showing your child within this app
they can't access anything else
so this is one of the things that i really really love about
this tablet is that they've got access to a range of things that sort of makes them think like
i don't have to worry about that kind of thing just yet um but you know that
basically it's safe so there is a web browse option but only approved websites
i won't show you my pin so when i take it to my profile um and obviously the tablet knows i am the
i am the grown-up and this is all linked to my prime account
you can see
i'm not limited in the way that the kids app is so
this is what i really love about this
there's the adult element there so say you do have a child
who's a teen and on the cusp of like maybe you're happy to give them some freedoms on the tablet
i can navigate to bella's profile there and i know that that's all she can do
she doesn't have my pin number and she's never getting it
she can't get that so all so her sort of whole thing
the only thing she can access is the stuff on this kids
plus app which i know is completely appropriate
so what's actually on there
plus tablet factual books story
books all kinds of things
this is a factual book about robots
all your child needs to do is tap to download
they don't have to do anything they don't have to purchase
it all comes under this kids plus app so you get one year free with an amazon kids fire tablet
that's one year free access to the kids plus app from amazon thereafter
if you have amazon prime it's one pound 99 a month per child
the thing that they've played with before they can browse through apps and games
this isn't free-for-all youtube on here
so i really love that
that makes it really accessible
you've got harry potter there
you've got cbb's characters
barbie star wars disney all sorts of different things
so that makes it really easy for your child
they really got the hang of it very very fast so i was impressed by that
as i said they'd had tablets before
but these were little leap pad tablets
they weren't like particularly advanced
they've done really well with it
oh you see my light there so just a few words on size and so this is the amazon fire eight
so it's an eight inch screen
it comes with this super robust case
and um what's great about it is
it's not just robust
um it also makes it super easy to grip so there's a bit of texture to this
my four-year-old is quite diddy
and she's got quite diddy hands but she has no problem with picking this up carrying it around
um it's oh it's about 500 grams in weight
it has on off switch volume switch
it has a port for um headphone jack
so just normal headphone jack to go in there
it doesn't take too long and i would say that the battery lasts for around about 10 hours
we have actually found that that does fill up quite quickly
gigs is good
um it fills up quite fast
there is space for an sd card
um account on the tablet so you can't just put it in and it works
you have to go log into your adult account
put the sim card
put the sd card in
not doing anything else
now i know that anyway because i don't let them take the tablet to bed
they can only have it
uh downstairs i don't let them have it in the evening
how many hours or minutes
i've got one child's device there their user data one device there
i can even see what apps they last opened
so i know without looking at the device what they've been doing
these kind of arcade style tap tap repetitive games
so i can go into settings and i can pause the device completely in settings so i can shut it down
what time they end
i can specify how which parts of the device
say an hour a day so say you're feeling like well
i'm happy for them to read whatever they want whenever they want
so those are my thoughts on the amazon fire hd 8 kids edition
i really really hope that you enjoyed this video
they are fantastic
they're robust they're really reasonably priced
they are built to last
thanks so much for watching bye
hey guys your own apology
taro shimla here
I was at the mall with some friends today and I was at Best
Buy you know just kind of looking around at some things I can get for cheap and it just so happens
I did find something originally had $178
I found it for around 80
it was on sale
so here we have the insignia 10.1 inch flex
Windows tablet with keyboard
yeah one or 10.1
inch screen 32 gigabytes camera
Wireless torture to gear by internal memory expandable microSD slot which is also very good
because we know we're gonna fill up 32 gigs pretty quickly camera
not the best camera
I wouldn't be skyping with anybody on this camera
maybe I mean I could try it but it's not as good as I say like a third party
USB type-c port and micro HDMI port other than that
let's go ahead and open it up okay
I'm gonna flip this guy over
there is no tape for this this time he's gonna go ahead and just
I think this is the way they want you to open it there
we go and of course we have get these out of here
we're just going to go ahead and just sit this aside
there's one more piece in there but we'll get to that in a moment
it is a really nice
you know
I don't get to go with it
you know for $80
why not you know where this is going
you're not much to see you know you got your charging ports here
let's see what else we've got
I'm gonna bring back the box because we know we have more take this up
here's the other section of the box
I think there's more yeah we got more stuff man they really put these boxes
I'm assuming this is yep
it looks pretty sleek and I can see where it connects to the laptop
like right here
you know
nice quiet keys
yeah although
I'm kind of feeling this I mean for for $80 for $80
this was not a bad deal and then
I just believe this just kind of goes in like that
yeah so we're gonna go ahead and get this guy charged up and we're gonna see what she can do so
I finally got to tablet up and running
at first glance
the screen is nice and bright
of course you can't see it here but isn't right on par with something
the internet is fairly fast as long as you use
Windows OS the tablet also comes off the keyboard and plugs back in easily
thanks to the prongs on the keyboard itself of course
the keyboard is smaller which can make it harder to type on
but that's a given considering
update is ready for your new tablet which is great too
the tablet is still supported for newer updates
there's just one big problem upon trying to install the update
you will need a lot more space than you already have on your tablet
I know being a bit picky about the lack of any real storage here
unless of course you're in the games like candy crush not that
it's already included on the system
I do give it props referent though as I will give this a solid 5 out of 10
I hope you enjoyed this review
please don't forget to
Like and subscribe if you did until next time this is your old pal
Jotaro Chima peace out
i got a charger a 5 volt charger uniform and a mini
USB cable along with this
now let's see this device has a place for your earphones
a microphone for mini USB cable place and a micro SD card holder
and this is the place for your charger on top
you can see the unlock button
the volume up/down button and back button so let's unlock this 9 there
we go so this is the home screen of a tablet
it runs pretty decently and which is
this tablet is great for playing some simple games
i played these games along
this tablet and watching photos is also quite smooth
what I found with this device was when I use the net
this device feels a bit slow but when I go offline and I play these games right here
they work quite well
this is a great and a moderately priced
Android device
hello director this is a review of the new tablet
I bought to replace my very dead
Hodel this is the Acer Iconia
one and it's canon tablet is specifically the b3 a 40 model
these two models of this is the black model
which is this one
I've been using it for about a week now
I'm quite enjoying it
I do enjoy the front-facing speakers
although the speaker grills are not or a bit misleading
the speaker is about here
and if you're holding it like that you do cover it up which
it's a bit clunky to get into but there's an SD slot and the USB OTG slot
which only does that the you can't connect it to a PC and it doesn't charge the tablet very it
I guess that's useful but considering the SD card support is for up to 256 gig
how often you're going to need that
I don't like having a lot having the things like that
I don't like having no app tray
so that's one the first thing
I did was stick
a new launcher on
snap and easy wake up which are unless you route it you can't uninstall those off the go book
it doesn't matter easy snap
I don't use easy
wakeup however is quite good because you can double tap on the screen to a kill a lie lap
so that's what that's one of the bits in it
it's just your standard
it's a fairly light tablet considering its size or I think is the back of it
I do quite like because it's textured plastic so it's good is good to hold
it's not soft touch which have been used on all the other tablets but this is a bit grip here so
I do quite like that
I had the odd lag on the home screens
where you switch into it like that but once you're in games it's okay
I'm not doing any hardcore gaming
just mainly boom beach and classes are really likening
all the games
so that's pretty much it
YouTube works fine streaming fine
it connects to both two and a half or two point four and five gigahertz
Wi-Fi so you get good speed out of it so for its price
I'd fairly happy with it
yeah so that is the Acer Iconia one
hi everyone
I got this towel a few months ago
I really like it so I've been meaning to do a review of it actually
it's got this blue a plastic cover on the back
it's got these
Adobe speaker bar up here so there's the two speakers one on the Left I want to write
we got a camera up there in the center
it's got a micro
SD card slot here underneath this flap
it's a 1280 by 800 resolution screen
this one has the upgraded 9 20 by 1200 resolution screen so
I do like the screen on this tablet
it does
it looks good
it's not as high-end as some of the other screens
I think it originally came with Android 4.4
this was updated right after it got released so now we got lollipop on here
I really do like this operating system
it runs nice and smooth
gotcha is a little bit different than other operating systems on android OS
and this is
Lenovo is kind of custom launcher here
we've got some different things
if you just double tap on the screen it'll turn it back on
I just got a set on standard view right now
I got to turn on right now
as a matter of fact you can turn on and off dynamic contrast
initially there was some problems with sort of the
I think was the volume level or kicking in so if I would kick
I have headphones plugged in or something it would mess up with the volume like when you unplug it
it'd be like really quiet
even at full volume they updated this like a month ago
I went ahead and just customized my own
some other things you can do in here
you can schedule power
on and off at certain times you got the screencast feature with Android 5.0 5.0 here
you can just cast the screen to larger device if you have the appropriate hardware
there's some different security options in here one thing
there's some other options in here
you got the face
unlock a voice unlock
remember somebody asking about apps you can save apps to your microSD card
you can actually set it as the default location if you want to
you got the text-to-speech
I went ahead
install the iPhone a text-to-speech because it sounds better than the Google text-to-speech
you got magnification gestures
you can switch over to large text
there's this weird high contrasting um makes the text kind of darker
I kind of like it actually but it does get kind of weird at times it is experimental it notes
there's some different stuff speak passwords color
inversions this is pretty typical almost tablets
who are interested in the benchmark
numbers should be done here in a minute
34 376 is the number for this tablet
all right
so here's the quadrant
a store score came in at 12 560
okay so the tablet has GPS as well
it's just not in it's not just a fake
the only downside with the screen is is
you can't view it with sunglasses on
he usually screens that
you can view them in one orientation or the other with sunglasses on either way you view this one
it's just a spirally weird color so it's not very outdoor friendly that's for sure and like all
Android tablets pretty much
it does show fingerprints a little bit more than probably some other screens
so you gotta kind of wipe it off a little bit more often but I mean that's not really a big deal
so as far as performance everything seems to run quite smooth with this tablet
I mean everything
HD movies play wells go ahead and load up this HD movie
just check the
Play Store taste nice and shoot very clear in HD
I'm not a big big video game person but I have played a few video games on here
I think that one came pre-loaded I certainly didn't load it
tap the Frog HD
which one did I load on here
that racing game
let's see here
where's that the real so this game doesn't play plays without a hitch
there's no issue with it with performance whatsoever
it's very smooth very clear
graphics look really good one complaint
I have about the tablet is
the camera doesn't seem very good
I don't know anytime I try to take
pictures almost always comes out slightly out of focus
it's got a 5 megapixel rear camera
I mean I don't know it does the job but it's not that great
I mean the iPads that I used to have the iPad air in
its camera definitely was clearer than this ones camera is so one thing
I wanted to talk about with PDFs on here
people are wondering how PDFs lay out
I kind of like the two column PDF layout on the Google Play
you're going to notice with a tablet like this with the 1610 ratio screen is
it's going to cut off to scale the PDF is going to cut off
there's just a big black space right here
smaller tablet does get scaled smaller
I kind of like how it handles PDF
just for the simple fact it has a few extra features like hyperlinks work and stuff
that play
I mean you don't have any sort of hang-ups or anything like that
you do have an occasional you know slow down here and there
everything's nice and zippy so comics the layout really nicely in portrait view
that really is no waste of space
anything like that comics magazines so
I'm gonna go ahead and wrap up this video right here
check out the e-book reader comm for some additional information
thank you guys for watching and you guys have a good day
good afternoon everybody madam
ROI back again back to with a review of my new Acer Iconia 1:8 tablet
but everything's getting back to normal now and everything's working so now
I can go ahead and continue with my normal filming schedule what I have here
it once again is the Acer Iconia 1:8 tablet that I purchased at Best
Buy it was on special
it was $69.99 normally sell for $99.99
so I got this for $30 off I have it sitting right now on a stand
this is just something that I purchased at Dollar Tree and it really works
I can go ahead and use the tablet maybe watch some Netflix
so if you go to your local
Dollar Tree in the electronics department
you should be able to see these it came with this and a stylus pen which
I don't use
I want to given that to a friend of mine but now let's get back to the tablet itself
it is model
b1 - 850 this is the 16 gigabyte
Wi-Fi only model so no 3 or 4 G access
in this
this will only work on the internet via
Wi-Fi running android 5.1 lollipop
it has a mtk mt6589 tablets but more than enough to play some games and watch
Netflix basically do all the basic same things that I like to do
with a tablet 16 gigabytes of built-in memory does have an SD card slot which I will show you
1 gigabyte of RAM now this is where I thought it was gonna struggle
but as you will see it really works well in this light
in this tablet it does have an 8 inch
IPS screen 1280 by 800 so this is a 720p
HD screen resolution is perfectly fine once again for what I need now
if you are a die-hard gamer
I would highly recommend getting something that has a little bit higher resolution
maybe getting into the 1080 1080
P range up here explains it has a rear 5 megapixel and a front 2 megapixel camera
both these cameras are total garbage
the cameras on here are really not not good for anything than your most
basic photo needs
the front-facing camera is good enough for Skype
but once again
I would not vlog in or anything with it
because it's extremely grainy and you got a lot of noise in the photo once again
you have the micro SD card slot
it has a 17.5
watt hour battery
I must say the battery life on this is excellent
I was very very surprised at how long it lasted
I can get with moderate use
so it's definitely got all the goodies that in modern tablets should now as for accessories
it's fairly basic
I believe is just telling you how to set up your Google account
the rest of the information is built into the tablet itself
see what this is
this is just basically telling you if you have any questions just contact
Best Buy and I think that was about it
yeah so that's basically it for accessories
IPS screen which is very nice
the touch the touch capability is very good
I'll go ahead and activate it real quick
it's kind of hard to do this one-handed but we'll get there as you can see
it's got a nice fluid motion
I'm going to go ahead and clear because I've read most of these already
these are just some of the apps
I have installed you got Angry
Birds Netflix YouTube
I'll go ahead and play a YouTube video for you guys real quick just to show you it
does in fact have a nice smooth fluid playback and as you can see it's not struggling at all
of course it's gonna have to play in ads first but here we go
I kind of regret using that picture yesterday
but yeah whatever yeah so as you can see
it's just using the one CPU because we're basically only running CPU Z
if I scroll over here you can see some of the different information here
it is indeed a 1280 by 800 pixel or a screen resolution on here it's got 212
DPI that's the screen density total of 970 megabytes of memory
and of course because it is android 5.1
it does use quite a bit of that so even just
Oh having this particular application open
it is running android 5.1
these are just some of the different versions
this is 4121 millivolts
which is actually very good considering the this is a cheaper end laptop and like
I said it's amazing to me
how long the battery lasts
I get I kid you not
that's the one thing that drives me crazy with these
there you go you can see
just got the one accelerometer sensor so like
I would highly recommend getting something like this because for the 60 70 dollars
you're gonna pay for it
alright so now that
I have the tablet laying down flat
you can see the various buttons on the side here
you have your volume rocker
basically up and down
have your power button right here
which is above the volume rocker very very typical design
I like it on the top here you have your headphone jack
next to that is the micro USB charging port
I believe that's a microphone
right there and right here is your SD or in this case micro SD card
I'll go ahead and pop that out real quick and show you guys
it's sad the one
I have in here
yes somebody send me a message
it's just a 16 gigabyte
PNY card so nothing super fancy but that means with the built-in 16 gigabytes
I have a total of 32 gigabytes of space
nothing on the left side and pretty much nothing on the bottom going to the back
here you can see you have the 5 megapixel camera right on top once again
don't expect too much out of that
get out lies and gentlemen welcome to draw with Gaza
I've been asked by people my impressions and thoughts on here on tablets and up until now
I also asked if they would set up a discount
check out the link in the description
it's a limited time offer for only six months from the launch of this video
so don't say
I never do anything for you because I just did
the five percent off discount
coupon code is helium to 20 and is valid until the end of
the question is how's the experience
stand up so
how did it arrive to me
and how easy was it to set up
I'm gonna say through the process of receiving and then setting up the device
the setup experience was really easy the stand came separate and not attached to the tablet which
it didn't have that flexibility
you absolutely can do that
which is great
they also sent out the device with the screwdriver
the pen came charged enough to use from the beginning but also
Bose over 800 hours of continuous use and to be honest
I didn't have anything that I felt
held me back drastically
I know it's a limited period of time but I do feel like within
I actually didn't experience that very much
the driver didn't have a double-click functionality
in the option for the button functions on the pen which
the other thing
quite a bit so
the device is eight hundred
US dollars the question is does that price pay for the performance and functionality
you get out of the device
my answer is absolutely
it's a tricky line to walk
but as someone who requires and depends on the use of a digital tablet every day
I didn't find the device
help me back from what
that's nice is even when not in use with pen in hand and painting program open
so that's my overall impression of the huion
GT 220 I hope you enjoyed this video review
this is definitely great
bang for your buck anyways
that is it for this video
I'm interested in your thoughts and impressions
you'd like to see me review in a future video
thanks so much for watching ladies and gentleman and until next time
I'll see you later
thanks for watching
make sure to subscribe to my channel for new content every week
here's a link to another video
Jazza is proudly sponsored by Adobe
that's it for now
thanks for joining the arty party and until next time
I'll see you later
okay so about two weeks ago
I could find on Amazon
I spend about 40 bucks on it probably
I mean it's okay like I said I still think it's a little overpriced
it came with some pre-loaded stuff so I'll just turn it on here
oh that's my daughter
yeah so of course you know
it's a little bit slow its but again
I got this for you know a 20 month old so I'm not looking to
I'm not looking for anything fancy I do like she discovered this
I do like that
I don't know if I'd really let them do that
I mean we have a TV but for road trips and stuff
this is really really cool that they have this
you know pre-loaded stuff here you just need
Wi-Fi and they all play pretty good but of course you know it takes a couple of minutes
it's not like your fancy phones or like for a 20 month all okay
this entertained here for a good 15 minutes so not bad you know
I didn't have to pay anything
this is all pre-loaded on it and then the games see some art
I haven't learning notes so this really isn't art
I mean she doesn't really follow along with it but you know that's okay
what's another one just lay out kind of see educational games games
these are the game
this is the game that it came with and this is perfect to you for some somebody under two
that just wants to woo you know and of course she plays more like this
okay so the other games here educational games
I think are pretty much you have to maybe pay for
are there demos
I'm not sure so
she liked this to see what this one is
I haven't really checked out all of these in here but you know ask you nicely okay
yeah she'd probably like this
I don't think we've discovered this yet
anyway for 40 bucks
I think it works pretty good
you know a lot of people were kind of knocking it and stuff and
I don't really know what kind of expectations they had
or if you're on a you know gonna go on a long road trip and you just want
oh yes it does that it glitches a little bit but you know
I don't really care um but yeah I mean I think this is great for you
it doesn't cost a whole lot of money
it just depends on what you're using it for this for my you know
infant to toddler kind of age group and so
I'm gonna go ahead and oh yeah there's some like little stories and stuff
yeah and get it in pink or green
those are the specs on it
I'm pretty cool
I would have rather have spent maybe 25 30 bucks on this but it seems pretty pretty durable
she does kind of like to pick at these so these are probably the first to go eventually
yeah that's about it
this might be one of them
this is the vulgar prior pad x 100 10.1 inch android tablet
let's take it out of the box in the box
we find a user manual
you get a plug-in charger
you have your power button volume up and down
there is a front camera and a rear camera will get into that
are your stereo speakers like that
now before i show you the actual tablet on and working
i just want to tell you
there's bluetooth is a gps built in
life shouldn't be that much of a problem as i had stated before it runs on android 10.0
i've already had it boot up
and we'll swipe and it'll wake up and here's everything you need now like
i said this is an android tablet
that's exactly what this did
do you want to go ahead and restore that i said yes
and there's all my apps just like that bam
go back in your bag and for games
i happen to like this one
it's called tune blast
you know this will run anything you can get from the google play store
i've been playing this game for many years now and have achieved many different levels
i have the sound off just for copyright concerns and you can see the performance of it really
isn't that bad at all
everything seems to work exactly as it should obviously like
i said it runs android
uh then you know
you can see playing a game like this quality is there
it does everything you need it to and that would be it
it has all of the options that you might expect from an android device
you have full access to the google play store
it's just a decent size nice tablet
there's nothing really special about it
that stands out it works well
that's the main thing i have no problem using this as a day-to-day tablet
it feels nice in the hand
it feels solid and sturdy all around really a nice unit
here is a still picture taken using the front-facing camera
the resolution of this picture is 1600 by 1200 netting approximately 2 megapixels
now here is a picture from the rear facing camera
the resolution of this picture is 3264 by 2448 netting approximately 8 megapixels
these photos were taken in the 4x3 aspect ratio
the tablet can produce pictures in 16x9 format
but that will make the front and rear cameras effectively 1 megapixel
these photos were taken in the 4x3 aspect ratio
which in my opinion is the correct aspect ratio for photographs
here is a video from the front camera recorded at the maximum resolution
it supports 720p
i'm now recording a video using the front-facing camera on the vulgar 10.1
inch tablet now
i'll switch over to the back camera
and here is a video from the rear camera recorded at the maximum resolution it supports also 720p
and here's a video using the back camera
quality is okay for a tablet
it's you know really a tablet something
this big is not something that you're going to really be recording video with
that's really better suited to cell phones and things like that but it's here it works
it does an adequate job
and that's really all you can ask for so all around the voguer prior pad x 100 10.1
inch tablet seems to be a great deal
there are some tablets that you pick up and they just feel like a piece of junk
i've had a couple of those over the years
generally those are like your quote-unquote bargain basement
units out there but for something like this
it feels sturdy
it feels well built everything in it is adequate
there's nothing that stands out
tablets are one of those things that a lot of people have them now
they've become innocuous and ubiquitous devices
all around you've seen the quality of video you've seen the quality for games so all around
there's nothing wrong with it at all
i'll leave a link in the video description where you can find it available for sale on amazon
thanks for watching
make sure you click like make sure you click subscribe and take care
we'll see you next time bye
hey everyone Leo bond here
I'm back again today
reporting for the best bi can at a plugin blog and this time
the smart tab features a 1024 by 600 resolution
LCD display so very nice there as well additionally it has dual front-facing speakers for stereo
finally a clear removable protective case is included
and it's just like any typical smartphone case
it's soft flexible
plastic and as long as your child isn't a thrower it should protect the tablet
quite well so this thing really has a whole lot going for it
which kind of keeps them from going places where you might not want them to in child mode
you have three main sections
so for that one
you'll actually need an internet connection now
the read and learn section has 15 different story books
that are audibly narrated
Disney's froze and it's on there and this fun little Spider Man story
you get the idea
I really enjoyed myself
you can pretty much draw whatever you like
I didn't try them all
I actually enjoyed the shooting gallery game quite a bit
which is exactly what we'd expect a carnival-style shooting gallery but the one that
I'm showing right now is called Prague poppin
it's a whole lot of fun
I could probably say about this thing
there's just so much going on with it so that would probably make for a bit
I do recommend this thing
so that's it for now as always this is
Leo bond saying thanks everyone for watching and have an ex one day
take that frog
what's up guys
Melling back here and I have a review today for Rey
this is the genius in 912 a graphics tablet or pin tablet as they call it um as you know
I love to draw digital art and I want to give this bad boy a review so in Melonie Mac fashion
we're gonna unbox it first here
we go so
the actual tablet itself is very big
this is nice
a lot of surface area for drawing and also included is this
Photoshop Elements nice RTF workshop
so we're good
let's check it out alright so
I'm here at my desk right now
I Photoshop started up here
we are going to draw so as you can see by my ugly drawings and scribbles and writing there it's
I'm not impressed
I'm really not and I hate to say this because I like to find good things about everything
I like to do nice loose long strokes and I can't do that at this title
I feel like I have to keep pushing down super-hardened like you have to
I feel like I'm captain like do this to get any like good lines out of it
which even bad lines you know
I'm just not feeling it
I don't like it
I know they're more expensive but you can either even get it like a smaller model
I would rather have like a small Wacom Bamboo create or touch the really small one
I think you guys should check that out
I want to make more videos where I'm drawing it stuff so anyway
thank you guys so much for watching
I hope you enjoyed this video
please like comment and subscribe
it really means a lot to me when you guys do that
and of course you're the best people ever forever
yes love you guys peace
what's up guys naresh here welcoming you back into another video and in today's video
which can go up to 128 gigabytes
this android tablet is only available in black color but matrix pad z series
they have got a z7 10 and all are available with the high specs as well
if you want to with this matrix pad z1
which is pre-installed with the protection
cover on top of it and is a very lightweight
no problem whatsoever
display the process of configuring tablet
you need to select the language
connect your tablet with wi-fi by typing in credentials
connect your tablet with wi-fi connect your tablet with wi-fi and it supports 2.4
it only took me a couple of minutes to configure this tablet completely
and it's all up and running now over the tablet
you also have a google play store from here
where first to start with you have a google assistant
if you set it up you can use it on your tablet calculator
calendar camera application
google chrome clock drive duo all the google application and a file option in here
which will help you to navigate files from internal memory of tablet straight into the sd card
if you want to now inside the tablet they also have a fm radio as well but for that to work in
now let's check out the video output performance
you're going to get out of
it is a 480p
actually that's a maximum on this tablet for the youtube
which honestly speaking
isn't that bad at all if you consider
this tablet will be used by kids and performance of playing video game over the tablet
isn't that bad at all
uh and performance of tablet 2 megapixel camera
isn't that bad at all
you can see me very clearly
i suppose now here i have all the pictures
just been taken using the camera on this tablet
you can see that how quite nice they are pretty defined actually to be honest with you
that shouldn't be a problem at all within the settings
and so much more in here and the response
time of tablet shifting from portrait into the landscape
isn't that bad at all
seems to be pretty much fast as well
now as i have mentioned before within the specification the tablet comes with a built-in gps
i am in the end of this video and now let me share with you
that's about it nothing else
or if your little ones who are under 10 now that would be completely all guys
thank you again for watching this video
if you think i missed anything please let me know in the comment section down below
this video shall see you soon into another one bye for now
some of you might remember that about a year ago
I reviewed the huion GT 220 V 2 tablet but today
I guess you could say that in this video you could probably look forward to
Helion having one upped their game
you get it kids
220 220 get allies and gentleman
welcome to draw with jazz
I'm Jazza and in this unboxing slash review
I'm going to divide this video into sort of three chunks
the first is the unboxing we can see how it's packed in what comes with the bus
the second is
I'll sort of go through some of the specs with you in this video
another the last part of the video
this video can be nice and informative
this video is sponsored by huion
Perot as how you know that's professional because it's pro
I'm a freshman can use that
it's actually really awesome of them
they've given the coupon to 21
Jazza and if you use that on huion comm or on your appropriate country amazon website
you can get this device for 5% off and that is on top of standing discounts
which is that's incredible
I'm excited to see what they have in store for us with the 221 product
now remember kids
this is fragile
sure they'd be careful when you are
open it up with you giant very sharp sword turnout to hold the blade oh good
I'm in the dull
this is a really inefficient way of doing this
but at least it looks cool and we unsheath the box
okay so this is the the actual box for the device not the postage box
you get a double of the boxing today
lucky you two boxes in one bloody day
Yui on thank you for choosing
I really love about these guys is
they're actually incredible to talk to you
okay so in this box
we have with a third box without general cables a few screws
I suppose for mounting you kidding me this comes with a smudge guard that I did not expect
I have never bought a tablet device that came with a smudge guard
Pro comes with the stuff you need for a stand and much like the 220
let's not look perfect
I was looking for a cleaning cloth
it's just got a little bit of that storage dust
so let's clean up our lovely new screen here
oh bloody idiots
they've got this fantastic protective
I don't need to wipe anything
are the new touch strips and shortcut keys so this is going to be fun to play around with
last time it took me about 10 minutes to set up the stand
so let's see how this one goes it's same
Stan mechanism with the the plate
where are they
this looks instructional
I don't want to wreck the screen but I do have to flip it
so let's use this lovely blanket
step one do this
nope that good step two do these
I think I'm done
that was two steps
I'm done so
I've never had a problem with to be honest
I don't even know why sped nibs are a thing
do you guys run out of nibs
I've never replaced a nib in my life
but hey better safe than sorry what do we get
I've got a gift
oh it even says gift
that's it cuz
I saw the the pen saw thing but I thought because this was the pen pen but this is something else
this is a gift
is this another pin
have you given me an extra pen
cool that's unique a spare pen very interesting now
I can actually think of useless for that
it is quite big but it's quite light as well and take it with you tube
so that's cool on the other hand
I actually have lost my stylus pens in the past
so that's probably the real reason they give you free pens now
once it's all plugged in
what do you do when you can't use the DVD or CD provided you snap the CD and then regret it
I thought it was kind of cool anyways
click on the Downloads
tab and you can find the driver
they're easy for you to download for Mac or PC download extract install
and you're good to go
drivers are officially installed into your GT 221 Pro
so that's really cool
it is a really nice little touch before you jump into the art creation with the tablet
click and the middle
Mouse drag and all of that stuff and then of course you have the shortcut keys
I also recommend experimenting with until you find something satisfactory
it turns out
I like something sort of second from the bottom
I cracked open my custom
all in all it was a really fluid experience actually surprisingly powerful considering
I was using this device running off of a laptop
it really felt like
I don't know I just do
you're viewing at the specifications also boasts a quick response
time specifically a 14 millisecond response time which for a digital tablet
that you're drawing on is pretty nice now as you can see
there are a total of 10 press keys and touch bars
some people love these and some people preferred the keyboard on the lab
I tend to be a bit of a keyboard on that kinda guy
you've seen all of that but the goodies
that surprised me
of course were the nice little carrying case and extra nibs the sexy smudge guard which
I really enjoyed using to be honest
the specifications rattled off what matters most at the end of the day
is the experience creating art on the device
the device was really natural to use
the first is the lack of a double click function in the quick click button thingies
that's a bit of a bummer for me
I made a bit of a workaround
that doesn't need to be there
so that's my feedback to hear on the other minor problem
I found it
but obviously that's a little bit of a shortcoming of the device that being said
I have a spare and even more affordable with that five percent discount
there are a number of significant improvements
the first that was actually quite noticeable to me is the build strength
bonus is the addition of the touch strip and the shortcut keys now again being completely upfront
I guess to best summarize how I feel about a device like this
let's sort of use the analogy of a cake right
I created the painting
you see behind me in the space of two hours with this device
I felt in no way inhibited
by its reaction time and responsiveness the pressure sensitivity once
that's just the best
I could do within two or three hours now
that's the cake
the cake is amazing now what
I mentioned before about the lack of the double-click and the slight funniness
and the bottom corner
the very bottom left corner not actually in where you would do any creative work
they're things where
I guess in the cake analogy
I don't know what I'm so focused on cakes
I really like cake
I guess what I'm trying to say is the cake that you get in this device
they don't send you a cake
I've got to stop talking about cake
I always recommend people to use a smudge guard when they use a display tablet
Pro today was delightful and I can definitely recommend it to you
I want to thank you so much for watching and of course make sure to
thank you so much for watching ladies and gentleman and until next time
I'll see you later
I sell ebooks
brushes photo references video courses and more
Jazza that's it for now and until next time I'll see you later
hi guys today
we're reviewing the goman m1020
so here's the device itself that i it comes with a screen protector
it does not come installed you have to install it yourself but here's how it looks
um here's a mat
that has some shortcuts which is pretty useful
um you're drying gloves
you're traveling buggy
it's a nice chocolate
it has a nice um quality
it's kind of like i'm sat in a velvet
i really like it um i must say it's one of my first time using one of these tablets
um so here's a pen
it has a nice feel
it's very
it feels very premium something of quality
i must say so guys
um i'm gonna do a testing for you
so thank you guys for watching and enjoy this video
i must say it took me a while to get used to this new experience
i must say this is a very great competitor to our the wacom intuos tablets
um it's very
it feels very premium i can
i must say though
um if you don't have a proper computer that is equipped enough to handle
photoshops are high intensive drying programs
you may experience lag and this is not our fault
um to the tablet but rather the computer itself so just keep that in mind okay so otherwise
it's a very useful and you know a nice minimal setup for the digital artists out there
it boosts the algorithm and remember to leave a comment just comment down
what do you like about eyes
and what do you enjoy drawing and ask them to subscribe
if you're new
we post art related videos on this channel uh you
mind the background
my mom is vacuuming but today we're going to be reviewing the um what is it called again
is it called dragon touch
i found out what it's called
oh well um so smells like plastic
no it smells like wet paint
oh my gosh
my dog is scared of the vacuum
no wonder usually dogs are scared of that right there
she's so cute though
oh no okay so this is the on button
hit the hold it
okay now
i'm guessing it's calendar
whatever that is
i don't know what that is meat
meats whatever that is if you go on this
there's all these apps
oh my gosh you're purple so that's basically it
i don't know what settings is yet
i think it might be here
nope that's contacts
so yeah bye
hey everyone this is teal from parka
box calm today
I'm going to review this graphics tablet that was sent over to me by this company called
this is the box
the design is very clean very minimalist
is that items included
I mean remove all the items
let's start with the cables first
this is the USB charging cable for the pen so the pen users battery it needs to be charged
battery life is rated at 14 days
that's if you draw non-stop this cable
here is for the tablet
the tablet uses wire cable
so it's not Wireless
this is the pen stylus
it has a nice weight it feels a bit plasticky but overall the build quality is quite quite solid
there's a cap in front to protect the tip
this cap is not able to go to the back
so let me just put this away
the grip section is matte surface does not attract dust
the grip feels good to hope
let's see what's inside this small pouch
that's the neat remover
and there are four replacement tips
there are not a lot of accessories included just the essential ones
there is no pen
stand the m10 six
K is a budget tablet from gum on the build
there are 12 physical shortcut buttons on the site
the texture on the drawing surface is matte
it's actually a bit smoother compared to welcome all who yawn tablets on this side of the tablet
there is this cloth pen holder
I feel that it's a bit loose so be careful not to let your hand fall out
I have already installed the driver so now
I'm going to show you what you can do with the driver with the driver you can assign specific
he watched shortcuts to the 12 physical buttons
I have a sign mine so this are some of the keys that you can assign they will give you this
you cannot assign control option and shift to the physical shortcut buttons so
I have already or sign mine out
I'm going to close this again so you can also assign the soft keys here
just click on the soft keys and you can do the same thing with the shortcuts in this
is the stylus pen by the way
this pen has 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity
the default pressure works fine
you can change the buttons as well
I mean a sign you can assign functions to the buttons on the pen as well
this is the work area by default
the tablet is going to map on 200% of the morning
the transition between a thin and thick lines is very smooth
let me show you how smooth it is
so we have some other brands of tablets
there's no lag at all
let me zoom down to 100% so this are how the lines look
they are very smooth and a deeper white gradually the overall performance on
Photoshop is fantastic
I have no issues with Photoshop
this is illustrator cs5 now for some reason when
I draw the first stroke
so it's on and off
it's very irritating
so this is unusable
the tablet is unusable with this app
illustrator cs5
I have contacted the company
and they say that these may work with cs6 or newer versions
so just at post cs5 it works on and off not just that when
I move the palette around it snaps back into place this is MIDI Bank paint Pro
it works very well
pressure works very nicely
the strokes the taper very nicely as well very responsive very smooth
just that when
this is mischeif pressure
works here as well very nicely
it's very smooth this is
Krita pressure works here very nicely
this is a finicky photo
it's pixelated because i zoom in quite close but pressure works without any problem here
this is a re sketches pro pressure sensitivity
works very well here now
that's because of the style of that particular brush
let me draw some thick lines by pressing down harder
I have contacted a company
you can let me know in the comment section below overall
I would say this is a pretty decent budget tablet
I have tested especially in Photoshop
it works very well too so overall
I think this is a really decent and capable tablet
so that's all for my review today
reveal the link will be in the video description below
thanks for watching hope
this is helpful
see you in the next video I you
greetings everyone the Eric here and welcome back to another product review in this video
we're gonna be looking at the artis you'll be 13s before we begin
I would just like to thank all of you who have come and subscribed to my videos
we have reached 10,000 subscribers
that is an amazing milestone so far so I want to thank you all very much
also if you would like to kind of help keep it supporting me
obviously subscribe all that
also check down in the description where you can find where you can pick up
things like t-shirts and skills are classes
t-shirts like this one here
which is one that
I drew and designed myself
I would like to thank RT shol'va as they were kind enough to send this to me
open it up once
I'm done with that
I'll come back here and then we can basically go on to a few more steps
alright so the audio for this footage actually gotten that stuff so
I'm gonna have to do the voice over you can see here
the box is really nice
I'm very impressed with the box
actually around the back
you have a bunch of information that you can read off
you know charge it
you don't next
I'm glad they give you that
it's good for portability up
next is a little box
that has little adapter so that you can plug this thing into the wall
this is the stand which is really nice
I'll show you how this gets set up in a little bit
actually so don't worry about that
next up we have the obligatory container that has the glove now
the glove doesn't fit me perfectly
I believe it's made for smaller hands
well sorry inside the bag you also get a little cleaner for the screen and a little startup guide
I usually do so
we'll do a ruler test all that kind of stuff and while
I'm doing that
IPS screen six customizable
Express keys a completely battery free pen that comes with two
the screen is not laminated
so you will get a fit of parallaxing
where if you were to view the pen against the screen at a sharp enough angle
I did the obligatory ruler test from what you can see
the display and pen had almost no wiggle at all
while drawing slow diagonal lines definitely one of the cleanest displays
I've tested in a while
what the wheel does all this
you can control in the driver software
this is a great little tablet and its size is really nice as I said so
it'll fit a lot of different situations
I again a few little gripes
things like not having the type see as one
connector is kind of a downside to me
I wish they had it all in one plug
I know a lot of tablets can do that
I think should ever deter you from buying this tablet but anyway don't just take my opinion for it
make sure you do some research you know
I'm gonna be signing off here now
if you'd like to pick this thing up you can use my link it'll be a Amazon link
I think depends on if they have it up in the Amazon store
if not don't worry
my t-shirts all that kind of stuff
make sure you subscribe
if you haven't to stay up to date with all my stuff
I am Yuri you know we've got our Christmas catalog out now yes I know
there's lots of new things in the catalog so one of the things that we've got that
I thought we'd go through
today is the tracing light pad so it's in this beautiful box here and I thought we'd go through it
we might do some drawing together
what do you think awesome
alright see you soon
okay so when you get the light pad out of the box it will be wrapped up nice and secure
there are a few things in the box for you to go through
this itself is the light pad so it's I just see if I can quickly show you how thin it is very thin
there's no protruding buttons
I call them
I will explain in a minute
I'm not sure if the if the designs coming up there but there is a little design there
you also get five double-sided coloring in pencils and a black tracing pen
so the pen itself is quite nice and fine
I won't be using it today or just if I don't really need it
alright to turn your light pad on
it's very simple
there's three different brightnesses and all you do is just here in
the top corner is a little power button
is we pick which one we want
you can do this as detailed if you just want to use it to get a basic shape and basic outline
but they're doing quite good drawing and then you want to make a birthday card so this is just one
I've scribbled out on some computer paper
you can what the way that I would do
it is turn your light pad on place that down where it might be easy
you can then get something like washi tape
I said make sure that's taped down
so washi tape is that it just removes really easily with no residue
so there's no problem doing that
so the final thing that
I do them from scratch but there is a way to do it
while you're learning that the light pad makes very easy
it comes with a few copies of this piece of paper
so what you're wanting to do is when you say you've people say we pick this one
today is look at your point and place that point in the point in the center
point of your star so very easy to do with the light
Pat on like that
then you pick up your blank piece of paper and place it over the top once
you've traced over all of the bits
that are here
so your dots
your spirals your drops
your lines geometric shapes purp you know petals and things like that
so now that we're done you can see
so that's one way to use the light pad to make a mandala the other way to do it is
I still utilize this form
all the way up made them darker
I then got a compass so we had used to have them at school
that's good about this
is that no matter the thickness of your paper there is going to be a whoops
if anyone's done any of my drawing lessons you know all about circles dots
I'm just making this up as I go
well okay look so pretty so you can make this oh sorry
Yorick I've got distracted there
so that's the advantage of the light pad - so
I've had enough for today
I just get my form back there
I just realized but again what you want to do
thank you your egg
that's great so what I'm going to do is still use my mandala piece because it's got the circle
I'll grab my piece of paper
it's actually a big bad move
Oh would he how to the moon
oh all the time
you can't stop it
I think that's cute not at midnight
it's not good
so that's your basic outline
you can then continue like you could decide you
were going to use the backing of the light to add stars and create depth and interest
or you can turn it off and continue to do that on your own
so that's the light part okay
so now that we've had a play in a draw
and there's a little patch in there so you can slide all your drawings in there and keep it safe
yeah and the brand here is nebulous
yeah but that's it and thank you for joining me for some drawing you all right
thank you star range
it's really cool and give it a thumbs up
I give it two thumbs up
here's the asus memo pad fhd 10
it's got a 10-inch screen
it's actually a bigger screen than the new
iPad a really great screen resolution
that's nineteen eighty by 1200
I believe which is a little bit less than the apple with the Retina display
I also downloaded adobe flash to this particular tablet you could still do it on the Internet
it's got a nice home button here hooking up to the Wi-Fi was very easy
I've done it on two different locations now with no issues and I have different browsers on here
you can see that
I've loaded a lot of apps on your haven't had a problem with any apps not running again
the widgets are really good
you have task manager
you can kill stuff with it but it's really good on this particular tablet also
I also have some word Vista you can actually click on make you type quicker
it's really responsive
the tablet to sleep is set for 30 seconds when
I have it set longer
here's one YouTube videos
I'll show you how it sounds right here you can see the sound
quality is great resolution is really good
so it's really loud for a tablet
it's a squirrel that I rescued and fast in the air
it has really good quality with the photos
also and it's very quick and responsive you can see here
let me turn on the camera as you can see it here
so it's got the camera you your one of most people carrying a tablet taking photos
it's also pretty lightweight and it has that nice color
I actually got a case for it right here
I've got a USB charger also or you could plug it into the wall
and here's a tablet in a true case here
it was a part on the side
here for a mini SD card you can have up to 64 gigabytes
it turns the screen off and you open
which they're the third largest manufacturer of laptops
you'll get this pen tablet with a big hello from brown coney and sally
this is what you get when you go for the star g640 line friends edition and yup
the pen that comes with the star
g640 is the p01
look at this stuff
isn't it neat
i got stickers and sticky notes and a ruler slash
bookmark featuring your hearty friend brown
what's left in the box are the micro usb cable and some paperworks
now let's put it to the test while i do the first step in creating my background
that's why i started teensy season
i actually prefer this small tablet especially if i want to work on the couch or at a coffee shop
hey it's just a background
don't overdo it
i can't help it
just kidding
don't do that don't do that
i add a bit of chaos here and there
now we're using the next tablet in the line collection the deco 0-1 version 2.
the box includes the pen tablet with 8 buttons
that are customizable
and there's brown coney and sally so cute
this one has an expansive work area measuring 10 inches by 6.25 inches
it's also super thin
this one's only eight millimeters and also includes its own translucent protective film
this line of friends edition is compatible with windows pcs macs chromebooks and android devices
and then we have some paperworks and the stickers testing notes and the cutie ruler slash
bookmark plus a brown pencil case
adorable time to put it to the test time to color
i'm not an expert when it comes to coloring
i don't know color theories and principles and stuff
i just do whatever i feel like
this is for you
i think the size of the deco 1 is this sweet spot for pen tablets
this is a great choice for working on the go
it is actually the same size as my laptop so it fits perfectly in my laptop bag
what's in the box
dial is one of the best features in a drawing tablet out there
it's super convenient for zooming in and out which you can set up in any way you like
and it has brown in the middle cute
drawing on an artist 12th row feels like drawing on paper
and that's thanks to it having a fully laminated screen which also means it has no parallax
then you also have the gloves
microfiber cloth usb extension with power adapter and adapters for different countries
stand it's so cutie pie look now time to put it to the test
now i'll add my favorite part adding what harris calls as the worms
i just add very mild highlights and shades everywhere and a bit of additional dreamy lighting
the problem with that is it just couldn't compete with an actual pen display
the feel is different and the response is a bit slower because of the slightly noticeable delay
xp pen gave me one of each tablet to give away
that means
i'm giving away three never-before-opened tablets to three of you guys
include a brief description of your artwork and your instagram handle
don't forget to follow exopen and myself on instagram
so if you want me to share your artwork just post it on instagram
but don't forget to send it on my email
good luck guys
thank you to xpenn for making this video possible
i'll see you in the next video
make sure you have a great day bye bye
Cintiq may finally have a legit competitor.
I'm excited to kind of try it out and see if it lives up to the hype.
I'm sure a lot of you guys know that I'm religiously working on my book
Nima and so maybe I can paint a piece from the book with you guys.
So usually I give a tablet away at the end of the video
but- Aaah! [PANTING] Milo!
I have three Artist 22R Pro Tablets to give away
Stick till the very end of the videos to learn how you can win.
So this is the Artist 22R Pro, first impression:
it looks really really sweet.
Look at this artwork!
And it's pretty light, you know?
My favorite part is always the removal of this plastic film.
I reviewed last year.
This one definitely feels like a more premium product.
Brought the tablet over to my setup and this came with the tablet, it is a box of wires!
Aahh gross, I definitely feel like they could put a little more effort into their packaging
especially when you have a beautiful product like this, it doesn't really correlate.
But you know what?
As long as this works and performs beautifully then I can forgive this.
for: is that it requires one cable to hook up to your computer!
I mirrored the displays, let's open up my Photoshop.
This is a character in my book named Amé and you might have seen her from the Master
Course Series, this is Faye's master and I love the quality of it!
Oh, it looks so great, look at that!
So this is the piece that we'll be working on today, I don't really have a background figured out
so maybe we can like spice it up, we can make a really cool background and set the mood.
I'm sure if you guys are watching this you are deciding
which new tablet you want to buy, is this one the right one for you?
Is this better than the Cintiq or vice versa, you don't know.
I researched some side by side
comparisons on a basic surface level.
So the 22R can be directly compared to the Cintiq 22
I recently reviewed.
For the most part they are basically the same, you know, they both have 16.7
million colors, it's the same amount of pen pressure
(8,192), has the same exact screen size (21.5"), same exact resolution (1920x1080)
That's a lot of numbers, I know
there you go.
And you do have the options of these express keys on either side, where the Cintiq doesn't.
To be fair, the Wacom Cintiq Pro does have USB-C but it retails for about $2,499.
Ugh! Which brings me to the best part about
this tablet is the price point and it retails for $699!
That's insane! $699 compared to the Cintiq 22 which is $1199.
Also I think there's like a 30% off deal going on so that's even a lot less.
So spec-wise, overall, on paper, as of November 2019
this is the best all-around tablet
you can get!
Which I feel brings super healthy competition to Wacom.
Wacom is like the king of tablets, right?
I've been waiting for that but hopefully, I don't know.
All that doesn't matter if the drawing experience isn't good and so let's give it a shot.
Amé is an arcane mage, just kind of like a vampire. She's deadly AF and she's awesome!
One really big improvement about the 22R is the pen.
It no longer requires batteries, that was something that I didn't like in the previous one.
Some tablet pens these days
require you to charge your pen
I'm like, ggurhgr!
But now they've caught up on
Wacom's level, you know, this pen does not require batteries or any power to use.
Yeah let's try to find one of these stock images that kind of helps us with our mood!
You know what, let's have her in the clouds.
I'm just kinda gonna drop it in and see what we can come up
with- oh wow!
And now she's immediately in the sky!
Let's try another one.
This one was another one
I was thinking, kind of like, maybe like a purpley cloud that's kind of cool.
Ah that's gorgeous!
Look at that, this really helped me find the mood.
Sometimes we can't come up with moods all by ourselves so we just need something to help us.
This one works as well too!
Maybe I'm gonna try to add this cloud back in
I really like it.
Somehow, you know just maybe like a little bit?
Ahh look at that! That's perfect!
Now it feels kind of like, like a bright midnight in a way --
is that a thing?
Bright midnight?
You can keep trying new things until you find the mood
that's right for you.
She kind of uh, appears with bats and so bats are her friends and so maybe we can kind of uh-
Do you know what bats look like?
I don't think I've ever studied what bats look like
And I have this hand on another layer, and so we're just gonna give it a glow- Oooh!
You see that?
That's contrast between warmth and cool.
Oooh! Arcane magic!
Oh look at that.
All this cool, you know, and then we have this focused point of warmth which really makes Amé pop.
And now it's dark!
But I think no video is complete without some color dodge!
Let's do it!
[MAGIC NOISES] So let's see how well this can color dodge. Ooooooohoohoohoo! That is so juicy!
And then one awesome big light bloom- Aaah!
Welcome back! This is Amé, I really enjoyed this piece.
I think it came out really well.
Will I use this on a daily basis for all my work, all my paintings?
I'm not sure, I kind of like my style of working for the last few years.
Best thing is its affordability, it is significantly cheaper than its competition.
The best way you can find out for yourself is if you just try out all of them!
And see what's the best one for you.
Read their return policy
and if you don't like it, you can return it.
Now the moment we've all been waiting for.. The giveaway! Aah!
Don't, don't fall!
The YouTube one will happen today and then the Twitter, Instagram will happen next week.
Rule number one: follow XP-Pen on Instagram and Twitter, rule number
two: answer this question!
If you could draw anything and have it come to life, what's the first thing you would draw?
I'm kind of diggin like a smoothie
right now, right.
Woh! Oh my god! A smoothie!
Milo! See these guns, milo?
retrorocket disk hey
Rob here and with me is lenovo flex 3:11 inch tablet slash notebook
it is multimode
I'll go into that a little bit
which i think is a bunch of crap the MSRP on this is three hundred and fifty dollars
you can usually get it for less
you're going to see it for less during this holiday season
I was speaking to you in the end of November of 2015
so that's what you'll see it on the shelves
this is the four gig model
it's got four gig
RAM 500 gig hard drive
there's a second model of this
there's no reason on earth that a laptop in 2015 or probably 2016
when you're watching this should ever be two gigs
do not buy one
I'm going to get a touchscreen and I'm going to get a two gig
touchscreen laptop no get them without the touchscreen
that has four gigs
don't waste your time you know
I hate to say it
touchscreen is really
it's mostly a gimmick it not on a tablet but on this kind of thing this kind of laptop combo
it's really just a gimmick so
I'm saying that I don't hate this device
you take the four gigs
you take the more
RAM and the more storage
Celeron processor which is mmm you know passable as mentioned it has a touchscreen there we go
ISO pose I will quickly go through the multiple modes
I've got photos of it in the multiple quote modes
it's well if let's mention our multiple modes first
there's laptop mode which is a standard laptop
configuration you can see it here
it's a very attractive laptop
we'll talk about the screen stand mode which
I'm showing right now
so it's actually pretty decent in this mode
there's also ten mode
make sure that you have the laptop set to be able to flip the screen
otherwise it's going to look kinda silly with screen upside-down but here you can see
is it anything more than just moving
a hinge around the hinge
the hinge rotates fully
so you can basically in tablet mode the keyboards facing down
the screen is facing up
you should of course immediately do that before you even touch the thing
let me login a second
let me just show you this
I'm going to login
we go now
Windows 10 so upgrade yourself to Windows 10 if you get one of these
that's pretty cool
alright so how was
I talking about I was going to talk about construction then
I will talk about ports and such so
if you don't really care about how it looks you can skip on a little bit and get to where
I think it feels really good
it it does feel solid
it's not too heavy but it doesn't feel cheap and light
the deck is actually aluminum
that is not fake that is actual brushed blushed
it's blushing brushed aluminum very classy on the other hand
if you look at the screen it's impossible not to notice that gigantic bezel
it's huge like look at that bezel on that thing
somebody's been embezzling
it's yeah it the bezel is too big it
it actually puts off the look of the of the entire device a little bit
I'm I'm just overdoing it
wise it's okay
I do like the screen when I'm looking right at it
the keyboard if you look at it it is a very flat keyboard weight
let's see if I can sue it
that's this shallow
you're really just punking the keys
that said you know what after a few minutes of typing on
I really like it I I like just
it's really quite nice
not a bad keyboard at all doesn't feel bad
I wish I could say that for this right here
this this little guy is it just feels cheap
you can hear the click but it feels shallow
it feels cheap
yeah the touchpad is not real good
that said it's responsive it works okay
I do like the fact that they bothered to put like a chrome edge around
I did mention earlier that it was a 500 gig hard drive
that's on this
it is absolutely not an SSD the cheaper model does have an SSD in it
but this one does not
so this is a mechanical hard drive 5200 rpm
I believe so let's talk about what comes on it it does come with some basic
I think it's McAfee Antivirus sorry
I I like totally removed
it right away it also comes with an amazing amount of circus
Best Buy or something is one of the few times
I'm going to tell you
hmm yeah it runs most applications now
I do a whole lot of indie gaming so if it ran my indie games just great
I wouldn't be running battlefield on this though
I don't think I would be planning to do that anytime soon
but for most indie games
it's fine casual browsing
it's quite good
it works really well
I've had absolutely no lock ups with it it doesn't get excessively warm
it stays quite cool even when
I'm stressing it so that's really nice and it's very quiet
that's kind of rare for a mechanical hard drive so yeah that is pretty nice port wise
well it's actually not too bad
well let's go over the ports on this side if you look right here
here's the power button
here's the bad part
I've just turned my laptop off
let's see USB ports
there's two on this side
there is a third on the other side making it totally acceptable
not bad at all really
it's not a mini
one it's an so will HDMI port
that's really nice
this is a real honest-to-goodness
Ethernet port you need you notice they can can talk to you alright
how are you really cool
nice addition on the other side
this is the power cable
connector interesting story about the power connector
it is really weird looking and man
I don't think yeah I did bring it
okay this is what the power connector looks like
it's this square thing
there's no wrong way to do it
so you can just plug it in there charge away not bad also there is SD card reader
this is really nice
there's a little rocker switch for volume
here and right here is a button that locks the screen position
you don't have to do it in software
it's just sitting there on a button on the machine itself so quite nice um battery life
I have found that I could easily get six hours out of it you and when I'm beating on it
I'm trying to remember what they claimed
I thought they claimed ten hours on it but I in actual use
I've been able to get between five and six hours from it so that's actually good again
I you know this is a $300 device really quite nice alright so I suppose you're wondering
hey what's the verdict
I think it's an attractive looking laptop which is kind of unusual in its price range
I think it has enough ports it has three USB ports on it
it has a pretty large hard drive for this range
I think it is great for work light duty home
it's not going to be a gaming machine by any stretch of the imagination
but you know you can play a little bit on it again
I think you'll enjoy this laptop quite a bit all right
well thank you very much for watching
if you enjoyed this video do me a favor give me a thumbs up and subscribe for more bye you you you
operating system it comes with a anal company
and this is a 7-inch capacitive screen tablet
just come with a few specifications like it has got a 1080p output of the video and it has a wipe
Wi-Fi connectivity
it has got a 1 gigahertz processor and 4000
mAh battery to back it up
so let's start with the unboxing of the fabric
there is a microSD slot here the 3.5
mm headset jack
and this is the mic for visual aids for the video video calling
these are the volume black keys and is the reset key
this is it can be used to by inserting a small pin on it
like icing on the enola novo7 need to hold this
these are the multiple home screens sacrifice to Dustin
that are already available
you can see the interface of the app
pages are shifted going to settings to check the firmware
actually when you go to the settings you will be seeing a lot of seniors in the keys
the way you towel things off and on that is all changed and you can see
Wi-Fi there is the connectivity option
this isn't a storage
that is the 1gb almost when he builds point and 8gb the large internal storage
the flash storage available is 5.9 3gb
there is no much hassle with the keys a very few a physical keys are given
these are all the ones power the back and the menu and another volume toggle keys
it won't be anything hard for them to start up with the device
it's not a pretty by device but we like the iniquity option of 3g
keep watching thank you
but let's find out how good they actually are
let's take a look at the
nothing too special
they're both entirely made of plastic
they're not the thinnest tablets in the world both coming in at roughly 9 millimeters
but it's certainly more than passable with great colors viewing angles and brightness so
I don't think many people will have too much of a problem with it while I do wish
the resolution was a little bit higher
it probably also helps out
they're both running KitKat
but we'll get to that in a sec
the camera around back of both of these tablets is extremely basic
it's a 5 megapixel fixed-focus shooter and no LED flash like most tablet cameras
it's not going to replace the camera on your smartphone which is most likely better anyways
but it's a nice secondary option if you really need it
Lenovo's camera UI is just as basic in bare-bones as the camera itself
there's a few basic shooting modes like panorama
HDR and beauty face but nothing too unique
that's worth mentioning if you're planning on uploading these photos to social networks
you don't have much to work with
as far as zooming and cropping goes and photos
lack a lot of detail
sharpness and dynamic range is pretty bad
life isn't terrible but I've certainly gotten better on other tablets like I mentioned before
I'm a pretty heavy user when it comes to tablets
I was hoping for between 7 to 8 hours but on the positive side
these tablets do idle extremely well
losing only between 1 to 2 percent overnight
the a 8 and a 10 are running on the latest version of Android with 4.4.2 kitkat
so it's nice to see
Lenovo keep these tablets up to date even if they are mid-range tablets
but not only
is it running KitKat
it's a mostly stock version of KitKat
which was very nice to see
there are some lenovo customizations namely the custom launcher
but you can't actually use it for multitasking
because you can only get to it when you're on your home screen
the good thing is lenovo does give you the option to disable it
they're actually better like the front-facing speakers and the higher resolution camera
I think they're pretty fairly priced for what they're capable of and are a perfect example of you
get what you pay for anyways
thank you so much for watching this review
Lenovo logo and on the center
there is front-facing camera
in the right corner there is small white
port is really good
tablet feels very strong and there are no plastic conscious when bang
Lenovo logo is discretely
nice printed and all the buttons and ports on label 19 near bottom
there is darker plastic bar with no functionality
impression is only spoiled by three stickers
Lenovo Intel and Windows but they can be removed with some effort on the back
there is back camera which is flat
a birth weight is 375 grams and the thickness is nine point
two millimeters screen ratio is around four by three
let's sight is empty and look right there
power and volume buttons
all corners are rounded and device is convenient for holding with one or two hands
applications will work good and observe is pleasing experience given the fact
the tablet have full windows
installed we will install desktop applications and run them with no problems
we try a dope
Lightroom and it worked fine for basic use but not for professional work
what should does not reckless drivers for touchscreen which is a dog problem like on most tablets
so you will need Mouse for that
memory is low and in run with hard drives which is disappointing
not for taking pictures
there is once patron device the top edge with distance and but your life is not great
I need to last for half a day of larva usage and three and a half hours of intensive usage
first let's say Microsoft
you did a great job
system is running smoothly blazing fast between applications in
this is phenomenal device good job
Lenovo and great job Microsoft
all right so today
I've got something really exciting
it's the brand-new welcome into his pro small
let's see what we've got here
is they're just nice
lightweight well balanced and also
they don't need a battery so never have to recharge it and notice
we'll get a little base for it here
if we pop open the base
we've got 10 spare nibs no different types of nibs for different purposes
then we've got a table comes with a nice rubber tie
good thing about this cable couple of things one
it's super long
it's a nice brushed aluminum with rubber feet
here nicely built same quality as in the medium and the large
there's no wrong way to plug it in
so if you want the cable up or down depending on how you prefer to work you can easily do that
get it out of the way so right
you just change the handedness to left-handed you draw here and use your right hand
so it's an ambidextrous tablet one of the other things
they all share the same features
they all work with the pro pen - they have the
this thing is small
it's light it's portable that means
I can just take it anywhere with me
in fact it's about the size of an iPad
maybe a little smaller than an iPad so I'm just keep this in my computer bag
which means that when
I'm on the go and I'm traveling
I'm gonna clients locations
another good thing about the tablet
let's hook it up to a computer now
this blue light flashes on and off means it's in pairing mode
let's go to the computer
which is the interest pro small
let's choose connect now says it's connected and we can see on a screen
everything is connected all right and we can see our window comes up here
let's click on stop
just choose next
we can import our settings from the medium
I'm gonna import that that's awesome
let's choose next now
we can turn the touch and gestures on or off now
these are actually something that we do on the side of the tablet
and then only the pen will have an effect on the tablet at that point okay
let's just go next and we're done so this is the Wacom desktop Center
okay now it's connected
I can't stress that enough people
don't install the driver or they have an old driver features
we're going to go under our settings and here we are inside the settings
notice here that the battery is about 43% so it comes about halfway charged now
how do you charge the battery
so let's have a look at the settings right now okay so we can go to
the functions enables us to set up the hardware on the tablet itself touch raise
Express keys the touch here
these are a touch settings so we can just adjust these kind of different things
so we've got our touch options we've got gestures
it doesn't have to just work as an eraser
there's a lot of different things we can do
with that
and mapping so you don't have to use the whole tablet and I know a lot of people will do that
so this is our screen area here
it's mapped to the tablet
I only have to go here so now
I just work in this very very small area and I know some retouches will do that
and they wear out their tablet here in this corner so if that's you
I would recommend remap it to different areas
so you can some even wear across your tablet however working with the small tablet
I don't think there's so much need for you to map it you know
OK and now that means from this corner is the corner of the screen
this corner is the other corner of the space
you could put your keys up here
you could have them down there
you have full flexibility the way you want to orient your tablet okay
so let's look at the first ones the most obvious ones are
that's what these are set for and we can change them
we can do different settings on the tablet precision mode
and we're gonna call this undo and now that one will undo whenever
I hit that button so you can set them up to do different things but notice right now
I'm just going in all or other
we can specifically set these for programs so notice
it's all reset again
a lot undo redo different things like that and in the bottom ones
what's out having to reach over the keyboard all the time
I can do a lot of that from the pen
let me show you on the pen here
notice it's set to double click right
click and we can do these keyboard shortcuts all these things
some people like to sit the forward and back button and sometimes
I like to do that too for undo and redo so that would just be command
Express keys a touch ring
alright so we can set this to do different things
rotate keystrokes scroll and zoom
okay here we are inside of Photoshop
let's just talk about basic pen pressure right now
so why don't we go down and we're gonna grab our brush
we'll just get a regular brush here and this is our brush panel
this is how we get into our different brushes
so there's a couple of things we're gonna look at shape dynamics that's gonna be size so if
how much pressure
I'm putting on the tablet now
the other way we could do is we could change it to pan tilt but that means depending on how
I tilt that pin
we're gonna get a different thickness see as I straighten that up
we get a thicker stroke so what
I like to use the most is transfer and opacity
I get a darker amount of that
brush okay so that means that when
I'm working on images
let me just pinch to expand say
so let me just go to my preferences here
I'm gonna choose my tablet
I can change my brush size very very easily by doing that now another way
I like to work
is this little padlock
no matter what settings happen
here's our size here is opacity and this is flow if we airbrushing so why don't
I'm just adding a little shadow in there little shade give it a bit more dimension
just adding a little dip here dropping this into the shadows all right
so why
you know just where it's catching the light
a little bit a little bit on here
maybe put this up to 30 because I want to just give this a little bit more
a little bit okay
we're just adding some depth there by dodging and burning with this pin
all right so
this is definitely feels like the pro
there's no lag
it's good pressure
response and a lot of those 8,000 levels a lot of those are pushed into the very light areas
so you can just use a very very light touch and that's one of the things
it wasn't registering and in fact just pretty much every other tablet
I've ever used does that
that's one of the things
you know the ease of use the convenience of this
I really love it
the price for the small is two hundred and forty nine dollars
so it's 250 bucks for this so
income is for computers so it's not
Wacom or Wacom
it's Wacom is the correct way of pronouncing net
I'm curious did you guys know that
I'll do them Friday on Saturday as well
I'll see you at the cafe
welcome viewers to a special product review in this video
this is an 8 inch
quad-core tablet with an isp display on android 9 operating system
in this video
you'll determine if the matrix pad s8 is right for you
stay tuned our full review is up next
welcome back so this is the box that it comes in
it's well labeled with some general info about a tablet to the back
you have the matrix pad s8 tablet itself
you get one micro
you have an 8 inch isp display and a 2 megapixel front-facing camera to the side
a micro USB charging port and a micro SD TF card reader and to the back of the tablet
it's one of the few apps that allow you to set the display quality from low to high resolution
you have single banner
Wi-Fi support and here chose the 5 gigahertz band is not supported
the operating system is Android 9 pack
and here it shows
the box is not rooted
the thermal information shows temperatures holding steady around 20 degrees Celsius
the box has chorus for playing 4k videos such as h.265 each EVC h.264 and vp9 decoding
and that's it for system and hardware information
we just saw that
the box is not rooted
Prime video to only show in basic 480p quality
this is the result of the n2 to benchmark the s8 got a score of 42 thousand nine hundred and two
this puts the s8 into the budget
category the s8 has single band
I also attempted an android game and played fairly ok
thanks for watching
give this video the thumbs up and look forward to my next video where
I featured a bigger model - this version
don't forget to subscribe to my channel and see you in the next one
what's up everybody
it's a 10 inch tablet running android 10.
it's got a 1.6 gigahertz octa-core cpu
it has a 20 80 by 800 hd display
we're going to play some games
i'm going to run some videos and you can also get this on amazon right now
let's go ahead and see what you get inside the box
okay so first off
we have the tablet which i'm going to be putting off to the side for just a minute
we'll go ahead and see what else you get inside the box here so here
it looks like we have our little instruction booklet and a little sim ejector tool here
supplies 5 volts to 2 amps
and it has a usb type a plug on it and that is pretty much it for the box
so here is the tablet itself
it feels like it has a all metal back which is surrounded by a plastic edge
and as you can see here we have our power button the volume rockers
our little microphone usb type-c right here on the bottom here
we have both of our stereo speakers and we also have a little connection for an optional keyboard
i also love the fact that this glass has a curve to it
it just makes it uh that much more sleek and less sharp on those edges okay
so setup's all complete here is the ui looks pretty clean
stock very simple smooth
so i've only installed pubg like i said it's already used 30 of the storage 9.67 gigs used of 32.
so we've pretty much
i think we have like 22 gigs
left that's still a good amount of storage and we have the expandable storage as well
this also does have support for 2.4
gigahertz and 5 gigahertz wi-fi which is always nice
here's our battery
i haven't charged it
this is directly out of the box
86 percent here's the display
no problems there
you can also turn on a dark theme which is pretty nice
another thing about this is is when you turn the screen off
it doesn't have any touch gestures
it looks great
it almost looks like it's 1080p especially on a screen this size
i don't see any lag
it's pretty smooth
let's go ahead and load up pub g and see what that can do okay so here we are in pubg
and if we go into our settings here i can show you what the graphics are set at so right
now the best we can do is balanced
the graphics are okay
it's pretty smooth
yeah this is looking pretty good
let's um it seems to be definitely a lot smoother than a pub g
we are in the settings
let's go to graphics as you can see
the graphics are set to low you cannot set it any higher
that's pretty much what it's going to be
it's pretty smooth like i said before
don't see any lag
i'm just not good at playing these
i'm better with the controller
yeah i definitely don't see any lag whatsoever
scrolling through previous applications pretty smooth microphone works pretty good how are you
i've been busy staying up to date on the latest election news
let me know if there's anything i can do for you
so the interesting thing that i found out is with the sd card tray there is a slot for a sim card
but i'm here to tell you i did
uh but it will work with your sd card just fine
camera here is capable of doing eight megapixels
the front camera five megapixels
the back camera for the video is only 720p and the front camera is going to be only 480.
the picture quality is definitely decent
it's nothing to write home about but again
are you really buying a tablet like this for the camera quality
i really think that the video and audio quality are also good enough
they're not going to be spectacular
especially because this is a budget tablet
but it's good enough
it's still just as smooth as it was when i first turned it on as you can see
i do have some amazon prime video
you can do that on this tablet very easily
just keep in mind that any video
you're going to watch
the max resolution is going to be 720
it's not horrible again
it's not the best but it's definitely going to give you a decent video experience now
one thing that i did notice is taking this outside to take some video and some pictures
there was a lot of glare on the screen and it did dim the screen down quite a bit
so if you're going to use this in home like i have here
i have some lights on in the background
this tablet is very capable
it's definitely going to let you do all the normal things you do on a day-to-day basis
it can handle some games
the viewing angles on this tablet are excellent as you can see
we're looking at it dead on right now
another good thing about this tablet
is its battery life
i recharged the tablet
it's still pretty nice and crisp
the sound quality is also really good
nice and loud
it's got those stereo speakers
it's got that metal back
it is surrounded by plastic but it doesn't feel cheap at all
it feels pretty sturdy in your hand and at no time
does it feel like it's going to break or you're going to be able to bend it in half battery
life is also really good on this tablet
you really shouldn't see any lag at all again
keep purchasing products to do reviews
so you guys so
i hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did give me a thumbs up
thank you guys for watching
i hope you have a great day and i'll see you in the next one later
hey everyone welcome back to another review
there is a ton of two-in-ones and chromebooks but not many tablets
they had the google pixel slate
that was uh kind of a bust right off the beginning but i feel like they've done a great job
optimizing the chrome os software for tablet experience
so i just wanted to check it out
that's unbelievable pricing
that feels nice
and then the kickstand is made of thin plastic
that is kind of flimsy but it does fold out and does have a wide range of angles
and then you get the charger and then obviously the 10.1
inch lenovo tablet now
first impressions of this tablet are extremely positive
i think it feels great
i even compared it to my ipad pro and it feels almost as premium it
has you know a metal back with like this blue accent on the top that i think looks great
the front is all glass
it weighs a pound or less just under a pound
i mean it feels great to hold
it's nice and thin overall
i cannot believe the value that you get for the price here as for the keyboard
i mean it's going to be smaller than your full-size keyboard
it's a 10.1
inch tablet so you have to go into a purchase knowing that this is going to be a smaller keyboard
might take some getting used to but i think the keys have great travel
they're nice and clicky
there is a trackpad again
it's gonna be smaller but it works
it has a nice click on the front of it
you can only click down on the front of it but it's a little bit small again
it works for what it is and it comes in the package so i can't complain too much about it
the back kickstand does have a really nice magnet and a good connection to the back of the tablet
i never felt like it was going to fall off or slide off at any point
the kickstand itself is made of a thin plastic
like i said so
don't be expecting like a microsoft surface pro type of kickstand here
it's not going to be quite as rigid as that
it is made out of plastic
so it's a little more flimsy
however the hinge does seem very sturdy it holds its positions
well now this specific one has a mediatek helio p60t processor that's clocked in at two
gigahertz has eight cores eight threads
it has a 10.1 inch full hd 1920 by 1200 ips touchscreen display
that's rated at 400 nits so it does get nice and bright
it has 10 hours of battery life 4 gigabytes of memory 64 gigabytes of storage
you're looking at bluetooth 4.2
but there's plenty of adapters on the market
that can do that for you
so taking a look at the screen here i think they nailed it
i think 16 by 10 is perfect
it gets 400
nits of brightness
the other nice thing
that lenovo did that
they did that moving on to the keyboard
the best way i can describe the keyboard is that it is serviceable meaning that
it's not great but it's also not bad either
it's nice to have is another way
i would put it
you know when you need to type out longer assignments or reports or whatever you need to do
it's nice to have the keys
are a little bit cramped
obviously like i said it's a 10.1
uh the one thing about it
it's very nice to have the thing about it
it's made out of this kind of a thin plastic that does kind of come out from the edge a little bit
also the kickstand isn't the easiest to pop out again
i want to make you aware of overall
i think it's a really nice package when it comes to performance
uh you know video editing software downloads and stuff like that
you're gonna be disappointed because number one
this doesn't have the processing power to really keep up with that workload and number two
it doesn't have the software
chrome os is super lightweight
you're probably not gonna be able to get all the software that you want on this
so just be forewarned in that
look at youtube netflix or anything like that
do some web surfing do some research on emailing you know all that stuff
this is perfect for downloading apps and games from the google play store
that's how this thing is built
i think you're going to be very pleasantly surprised
this thing does hold up very well when it comes to
it handles it all very well
you can play games on this device
you can download those from the google
play store now
you probably aren't going to be playing
you know super intensive games like call of duty and whatever else you might be looking at
that might be able to play on a pc
everything seems to run efficiently
multitasking seems to work a lot
life has been really good as well now
they claim 10 hours again
in fact i cannot believe you get you know
a 10.1 inch full hd tablet that runs efficiently and runs well
and you get a keyboard and kickstand in the box
right now so again
in my opinion a terrific value a terrific device for a student or someone
that's looking for a secondary computer that has a lot of functionality
this is a perfect solution in my opinion
make sure you check that out guys
i really appreciate you watching
make sure you like and subscribe and i'll catch you guys in the next video you
hello friends welcome back and today we are going to do toss three
Dow tee pad 10.1
so it's a dual
SIM tablet
just wrap the main tablet now ok
I have this back one along with the back
made of pop grey matte grey color
which is nice to hold nice to free land yeah the no
Ling effect here in the top on the side you can see there is lips side
that is nothing the bottom
there is a stereo speaker provided and on right side there are lot of things going on
here you can see
there is a aux volume control and power buttons on top
you can see there is a charging port
it's a USB C type charging and then there is accessory box provided in the accessory box
and show you
they have provided the long USB C type charging cable which is quite long to use
and which is good thing
so you don't have to be near to your socket and then there is a adapter which is again
I like it even though
it's not a fast
charger is normal type
but most of the manufacturer and it stops giving the adapter that is giving us
let's fire up the main tab okay so by default it's into portrait mode under unlock
it unlocking is quite fast
let's try to open some page
and it's loading the page quite fast
let's try to load the Google main page
ya can see
yeah it's loading quite easily without any hiccup okay
the scrolling is a little bit sluggish
but not which will irritate you
try to load the YouTube to load some video
yeah as you can see the buffering and everything is quite fast
there is not much delay into it so finally
what is online
okay yes so that's I think it is
it's quite normal
you can read
the newspapers or the fonts are readable
this is the perfect tab to check for
thanks for watching my channel when I stay bye
the performance is not bad while web browsing is fairly smooth
more complex pages may take a few extra seconds to load
the k77 has a half gig of ram
which is a little on the low end but unless your child does a lot of multitasking
it shouldn't be an issue
the display does have a narrow viewing angle
this helps protect the tablet from small drops and bumps which are bound to happen with children
this also helps make the tablet easier to hold for small hands
simple games play very well in the tablet
such as subway surfers shown here the tablet is also fine for watching
YouTube videos and Netflix
onboard storage is limited to eight games
but it can be expanded with the microSD card using the slot
in the back there is also a headphone jack
if you're not using the cover overall the king pad kaydee seventy-seven is great for kids
thanks to the durable cover that can stand up to some abuse
the snappy processor is sure to keep kids entertained with gaming streaming Netflix
thanks for watching
okay guys so today
we're gonna review the trust tablet graphic tablet so
I finally got a graphic tablet
so let's just open it up
okay guys so this is harder than I passed okay
so here's the actual drawing tablet so just oh look
there are the batteries so yeah let's open this up
oh my god this looks so good
oh here's the pad okay
I think this is the connecting cig
okay uh I think this is it
flexible design tablet
okay so
okay guys now we what we are at the actual reveal
so here's how the tablet feels
it's pretty good
I like it though
we need to install the drivers so cut to the computer
okay so now
we're at the computer and right here is the link of the of the files
I mean honestly
okay now we have
the shared drive her pistol
so oh yeah oh no my my cursor is stuck
oh we gotta make it unstuck with a big snap
so now we're at the part where we're gonna do a little bit of fast paint so yeah let's just okay
that happens sometimes so yeah let's
I'll just start with the speed paint
roll the clip
okay guys
this is the final result at that
we all got this
this was actually very cool and very careful
they're like actually a lot of people
say that it's bad and you should not use the circle tool but apparently
what's up guys so
I've been excited to make this video for a while
it has finally come in the guys over at artist
souls sent me
this drawing tablet asked me to to do a review on the channel
so here it is just unpackaged it so uh I am
I get really annoyed of it
that's probably why
I haven't touched the thing yet
so yeah if you're looking into getting the tablet
hopefully this video will kind of help you out in making that decision
so here's an unboxing
this was recorded in a professional
Hollywood studio in totally not on my kitchen table
you'll see as we unbox this
we have the tablet enclosed in a very soft sheet of whatever that is
I don't know how it felt good
it felt sturdy
it felt safe in the box the last thing
I was worried about
was it getting damaged by how it was placed so of course
I have to record the most satisfying part of any unboxing and that is the screen protector
coming off
looks super good and by the way that little red dot in the corner
that's my camera
you can basically have it at any sort of angle you want
you also get a 2 button pen
which is super useful for mapping different functions depending on the software
you're working with now before we go into the tablet even more and do some drawings
there were a lot of setup issues
I ran into now
I don't think this is the fault of the tablet itself
I just think it is a combination of Windows
10 being weird with tablets and also the firmware
you need for the tablet so let's quickly discuss how you fix these setup issues so first problem
I encountered was where I actually tap on the screen but it goes back to my main display
so it's not even working correctly with the tablet
this fix was really easy
you just download the firmware for the tablet and then install the drivers after setting that up
the tablet was working flawlessly
everything was super responsive
know sort of delays or weird glitches on the screen
it worked exactly as intended
so here's a sculpting time-lapse
I did following grant Abbott's beginner sculpting tutorial
you know
I'm sculpting and I want in deeper indents
I can just push the pen down harder
I have this on a flat surface and push my hand against it whenever I'm drawing
it has that little pressure bubble that comes up on the screen
I have is with the pen
it feels really nice to hold and there's nothing wrong with it but the buttons on the side
just feel cheap and flimsy now the buttons work
fine they're completely functional
it's just a feeling that
I can't help but notice
I think those are the only two complaints I have about this thing
okay first things
I think that's a good price range for it
this thing is still awesome now
obviously they sent this tablet to me for free in exchange for a review on the channel
but with that being said
so if you're interested there will be links in the description to it
presenting a growing little ones video
this is the VTech light-up baby touch tablet and it's super super cute
it's very much like a tablet so
place them in the comments and subscribe to my channel for lots more toy reviews thank you
you will be saved yes you will save
hey everyone it's siege
welcome back to author video
this video is a tablet review
i will do so for today
this video is brought to you by gaomon again
i've reviewed two of your tablets before pd1161 the s620
and now
i'm going to be reviewing i'll show you the screen
the pd 1560
which is this baby right here
it says it is fragile
it was another box but more presentable
this thing right here
your girl actually ripped the plastic off
so that's good
i guess this also came with a felt case
which kind of surprised me actually okay
i seriously should stop laughing at this
oh my gosh
and then you can see the tablet itself of course before drawing with the tablet
i have to download the driver as usual so i went to their site downloaded the driver
it has a 15.6 inches of work
area 8192 points of pen pressure
10 short fit keys
hey i am back
i just finished the setup
it's pretty bright so i'm just going to give it a focus here
everything is all set up
so let's get drawing for the speedpaint
i decided to draw darkflower31
so it's something new for me to try out
i'll get into my thoughts about this tablet later
just enjoy the speed paint for now so now bye me
oh all right so my thoughts about this pen display
it's pretty good end of the review
just kidding it feels pretty good to draw on and i got comfortable right away
the colors are really nice too but it seemed a little bit warmer in the tablet
but it's no biggie
i absolutely love the stand
that comes with this tablet
it's really easy to use
you just have to pull the lever behind it and then tilt your tablet or stand then boom you got it
the response time of the pen is really good as well
there is a little bit of parallax between the pen
would i recommend this tablet
yes i do if you are a beginner and you want to start off with a big screen tablet then here you go
this is for you
this is also a fit for intermediate artists and hobbyists
knowing that there are a lot of screen tablets that are really really pricey
i would go for this tablet immediately
and we're done now
here is the finished drawing of our flower video
i really did have fun drawing her oc
so and that's all for today's review
thank you so much for watching
bring it in today for more updates and my videos
that's all for me
thanks so much for watching
thank you again
gaomoon for sending this wonderful tablet
i will see you guys in the next video peace
i don't know how to unbox boxes because this is my first time unboxing an actual box
but let's see how it is
i'm probably gonna fail a lot here and it just
i shouldn't do that
keep it kid friendly
i have no idea what i'm doing
uh oh i screwed that up
i'm having troubles
can somebody help me here
we go put this away get it out of there all right
i'm just gonna
i didn't mean to do that but okay you
hello and welcome back to another video review
I am the takács and here back with another case review for the 2015 Amazon
fire tablet the 7-inch 50 dollar model
I even pick up at your various locations
Best Buy Amazon and so new style
set me over some cases
this is their kids
highly protective stand handle case built out of a really rigid foam
so it's very very protective wraps completely around the the Amazon fire tablet so
let's go ahead and stick this in here and I could show you
Oh kinda is a tight fit you just kind of work it around
the speaker and of course the front camera is not covered at all
take the tablet out to get to that easy access to it
obviously easy power out and power off volume
the nice thing about this is that you know
obviously it's very protective and it's a really easy one to hold and handle so for kids
I guess maybe of sorts
and that's the big point about it and very portable
I guess easy to take around with you now
the the fire tablet doesn't have the best camera in the world but like
I said there are the cutouts for you
that's very very protective and easy to grab and go right
subscribe to the channel
check us over on Facebook
we're at tech couch
basically on all the social media so let it checks out otherwise
we'll get you next time guys
model number is ma and it's a 8.4
inch tablet so let me go through some good features
the first thing that stands out on this tablet is the build quality
okay it has an amazing metal body slim design you can see see by looking at it
I just feel like you got that quality
okay now let me when I switch on will see how the quality of the operating system is
it has a touch home button here
it has a front camera on the right side
he has the volume up and down button and the power button at the bottom
he has the micro
SD memory card
jack as well it comes with a free USB type-c charging cable and a mains plug
okay so that's why it comes with no case
I'm gonna switch it on so the button and she's switch on Sony switches on
I mean it takes ages this loading bay for lucky you know the latest Android tablets or smartphones
they meant to take a look
so let's just wait for it
when he loads up he goes
it doesn't go to you like how you have to login with your username
you have to set them up on your own by going to the settings
I'm going to placed on
its own and you know say up so
I don't it does have Android 7.1 billion
the resolution is 2560
x 1600
it has a billion eighty a 63 64 bit processor
one good thing about this screen is that it plays back 4k video okay
so that's another good thing and that screen looks amazing
that's probably the best thing about this tablet and it's a 8.4
inch screen you can see here
we've it also has a smart color
3.0 sharpness and hunt enhancement booing
you can see
it doesn't have no screen protector or like a case so okay
it does have a screen protector
so when it comes to protection is quite difficult to buy spare parts for it for this
it also has a ridges blue light
am i protecting blue
in so at nighttime you can look
I has a feel free gig
ram and 32 gig internal memory but you can also put a micro
SD memory card and you know
ok so you know you don't have to worry worry about taking forever
so eight gigs
already taken up so you got just a bear around just say your 25 gig left ok so to download
I mean that's - ok
it's not ok depends
we're gonna give your downloaded some game that does take up couple of gigs
which is well known everybody
7.1 that's the version and
Maru is ma
ok camera wise is so bad meaning okay probably has a think around think okay
he's quite slow
you can see that haven't downloaded anything when I was trying to go back
you see they had to press a couple of times to actually go back
the camera is really bad
okay so this is the quality looks this looks like a VGA camera when you take you know frantic foes
let's try it a uniform
okay so it does take the phones and it also saves on this side okay
but it's you know the quality isn't the best okay
there was the video camera
wouldn't be the best but the fact that you can do a video camera and videoing
that's the best thing about it
okay now in my opinion you know this tablet
it's a 50-50 tablet okay
it has the build quality it has
they're 4k video playback it has a USB type-c it has a high battery capacity the downside
is that you know it is quite slow the camera
it's not that it's not the best
so thank you for watching my video
please do give a like and subscribe
hello my name is Peter parfaits and in the next few minutes
I will be talking to you about this
you're using a stylus or pen like this with no wires
now many of you are more used to seeing
we're talking about woodworking subjects
I write for the UK magazine the woodworker
and if you're then gonna get one of your photographs on the front page of
what is a national magazine like this one of mine
then you've got to put a significant amount of effort into that now when
I took this photograph
there were a couple of things in the background that
I really didn't want to be there but they weren't under my control
there were two cars
there was a person walking by and so on and so
the whole process would have been much easier now
there's a small and a large as well
you get the pen you get a pen holder and inside the pen holder are some spare tips
and if you have the optional wireless kit installed there is an on/off button for it just here so
I'm now going to connect the USB cable I know
the tablet is connected to the computer now on the surface of the tablet is the active area
and we'll see that a little more in a minute and associated with the touch ring there are four
the tablet can detect pressure from the pen at 2048 different levels
now this is
Photoshop and I've got the brush tool selected and I'm now going to draw a couple of lines
let's start with one way
I press very gently and now we'll next up
it's going to be thicker if you don't like what you see there
you turn the pen around
I've programmed one of these keys to be a delete key and so there
I've just deleted what I've done now
this is the pen one
the top button has this drop-down menu associated with it and the bottom button a similar menu
and you can set that however you like lots of different options
it says display toggle for multiple displays
well that's fine
but if i go to photoshop it says it's a keystroke and it's ctrl alt Z which means it goes back up
that's one step backwards
so that's what
I programmed it to be for Photoshop
and you can set these up
I'm just going to show you one simple example of this
I've got Adobe Premiere Elements running in the background
which is what
I'm going to say ok now
I want to know the left
it's moving that cursor left would one click at a time if I press the top one
it's moving it there right unclick at a time
now let me give you just a very quick example of one way you can use this tool
I'm trying to remove their pencil lines on the top of a piece of white plastic work surface
that's perfect because that means now
I don't have to keep altering the size of the tool
I just use it and press harder when I need to and so there are my bits and pieces healed
and there's one down here in this corner and that's it so you can do this very easily
isn't that nice
let's see if we can get rid of that
run of glue doesn't look very clever and there we go
now here's an example of something
we try and find myself having to do quite often
I've got a picture of a tool
but the background is rather scruffy
Photoshop is doing a lot of this for me
because it's a clever bit of software
it detects the edges quite nicely however it still does help when you're using
it's coming into effect here and that's wrong nice
that's that done
I can now copy
that layer whatever it is
I want to do and then I have that there copied add a new layer
and let's fill this the nice soft the way we go so they were
you can use the active area of the panel
just like the the trackpad on a notebook computer
I'm not going to describe now but you can look those up on the Internet
Photoshop it might be Premiere Elements it might be AutoCAD
I've really enjoyed having a play with this in choice
5 medium tablet for me
it's a smaller thing altogether and only has 6
Express keys instead of the 8 that we've on this machine
thank you very much for watching
I've enjoyed doing this and with any luck for my birthday
I'm going to get the small touch version of the insurace 5 thank you
- Today, it's the $1,000 tablet versus the $100 tablet, plus a drop test that led to this.
Hey guys, I'm the Deal Guy, Matt Granite.
Welcome back to the channel.
First of all, if you like this content, give this video a thumbs up.
It lets me know what type of content to make
I am going to do a full unboxing of the Fire tablet
and you're going to be amazed where this actually outperformed the almost $1,000 iPad
Pro. It's shocking.
And then obviously, you'll see the night and day comparison on where this tablet holds its own.
So let's go to the unboxing and the test.
All right, let's begin with the unboxing.
You can see
I always wear shorts when I'm wearing a shirt and tie.
Just a little secret.
It's not gorgeous.
It's very practical.
You get the charge cable.
You do get an adapter.
So that is key.
And your welcome catalog. All right.
This is a nice wide-screen tablet.
Let's turn this on and set this up.
You can see the screen size.
So, the iPad Pro uses Safari and Amazon's own Silk browser is present on the Fire tablet.
With that being said, let's do a page load test.
I did a video on how to instantly make your Wi-Fi speed faster.
Let's see which one loads faster.
One, two, three. Silk.
That's actually by a second, right. That's unbelievable. Let's go back. Let's try this again.
Silk should not be faster.
Let's go to, I'm trying to find videos that I haven't opened before, so "10 Shopping Secrets."
There we go.
All right, here we go.
One, two, three. Silk again. All right.
That is frightening.
There we go.
Matts, you can see it's cached.
All right, so the iPad should have an advantage.
Let's try, one, two, three.
Okay, the iPad had an advantage on a cached page.
That's what it's telling you to do.
For this page load test, I'm going to load the $24 action cam deal that I featured.
One, two, three.
About a second on the iPad Pro.
The iPad Pro is generally supposed to be a second faster on video.
For whatever reason, the Fire tablet was faster.
If you look at the pages side-by-side, you'll notice that the retina display on the iPad
Pro is a little bit
Everything will move unbelievably quickly.
Page scrolls. It's a fluid operating system.
But that's understandable, right?
We're comparing a nearly $1,000 tablet to a nearly $100 tablet.
I definitely get a lot more annoying pop-ups on the iPad Pro in terms of backup and cloud storage.
You'll notice though that there's not a huge difference between the two, right?
I'm really impressed by this.
I am very high up over the city of Toronto and I am going to shoot both photos and video.
And I apologize, it's a little bit windy
So we're gonna start with a photo on the iPad Pro.
Let's actually, let's come over here.
Let's do a really good photo.
All right, here's the photo from the iPad. (camera clicks)
And I'm obviously gonna show this to you guys side by side.
And let's do a photo on the Fire tablet.
Let's do video.
Gonna switch to video.
I'll tell you that even switching between photo and video is not that simple.
You have a, there's like a pullout menu that...
There we go, camera and video.
It's not that intuitive.
Let's go to video and we're gonna shoot video now.
I'll do a panning shot, so I'm gonna.
There you go this way.
I'm trying to do a fast pan just so you guys can see how this all looks.
So this is the Fire tablet panning video.
My daughter calls these toy cars whenever she looks down.
She doesn't realize that they're just cars from a distance.
And now for the Fire tablet, obviously you're gonna get 4K video.
Just looking through the city at this display is night and day.
But again, you're spending over $900 for this.
I would expect the camera to be amazing, and it is.
(camera clicks)
And now for the drop test.
I'm not going to drop a $900 iPad Pro onto the ground.
I'll tell you exactly what's gonna happen.
That screen's gonna crack and I'm not gonna pay for it.
So here we go, one, two, three.
(tablet thumps)
So far, so good.
No markings on the case.
Let's go again, I'm trying to get it face down.
One, two, three.
(tablet smacks)
That's gotta hurt.
And it is cracked. Completely cracked.
The only difference is the case itself, and this is where things get very exciting.
I'm going to show you that, no matter what I do
(tablet bangs) (tablet slams)
That was hard.
And you'll look, the back is almost completely unscathed.
You got a little bit of issues on the border, on the rim, but let's go again.
(tablet slams) Almost perfect.
I'll do one, one more slam test.
One, two, three.
(tablet bangs)
So what have we learned from this video?
at the time, it held up better than the new Fire tablet.
This was a quick break.
My point being, other than that
You're not out all the cash you would spend.
Even to get the screen repair on an iPad
Pro is more expensive that what you would experience replacing this whole tablet.
Now that I'm back inside, I'll show you that the smashed
Fire tablet is working beautifully.
I can see all of the photos that I took outside, my video.
Kind of amazing, right, despite all of the smashes and slams that I gave this.
Beautiful. Now what is the big takeaway message?
The Fire HD 8 is a fully capable tablet for consuming content.
That means Prime Video, Netflix, all of your favorite apps.
With the Amazon Alexa service built in, you can simply say the A word. Alexa, turn off the studio.
Alexa, turn on the studio.
So you have the ability to control your whole home from this almost $100 tablet.
Yes, you can do that with Siri.
But I'm trying to explain that
the functionality tied into this tablet is unbelievable.
This is a tablet
that's going to get it all done.
This is a great way to use this as a control mechanism for your smarthome.
You could even use this as a secondary universal remote control for your television.
editing, that is 100% not your tablet.
It can help you in different professions, and this tablet might not be the one to grab for that.
Pro is more than the entire cost of this tablet, just to put that into perspective.
So well done for the designers of the Fire tablet, and the iPad
Pro obviously doesn't need me to give it a two thumbs up.
You'll know why that is good, although I don't like the price.
So I hope you did find this interesting.
And again, if you did like this content, please feel free to give it a thumbs up.
I really appreciate you watching.
I know your time is valuable.
I know your money is valuable.
So I'm honored to have been a part of your day. Bye-bye.
what's up guys chicks
here from chicks tech reviews so today
I've got my hands on a new two-in-one tablet by Chewie
I'm gonna unbox the keyboard so here we have a case
QWERTY keyboard and in magnetic dock connection for the tablet
so here is the keyboard you also have touchpad included with two buttons
the keys themselves feel quite nice to type on the keys are not wobbling around
they're not like the cheap keyboards you get
it does feel quite nice
let's get the tablet out of the box
it is guys the high ten plus a very nice-looking two-in-one tablet so on the front
we have a ten point eight inch
so this tablet also has dual cameras
10 home and android 5.1
we have an 8400 minion battery
USBC fast charging the back of this tablet is made completely from metal
and you've got
this brushed aluminium effect
it looks really nice
the tablet weighs only 686 grams and only eight point five millimeters in thickness so
you've got a pretty decent build quality very nice screen
viewing angles are great
colors look sharp and vivid and the full
HD screen is gorgeous
it's nice and bright and an absolute pleasure to look at so
we have a power button and volume rocker
the buttons are made from metal
and they feel good to the touch
so on this side we have a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack a mini
another bottom of the tablet
so you can stream a maximum of 1080p on YouTube through the Android system
now we're gonna check out the gaming performance
I'm going to be using the game
so g4s controller which are connected via bluetooth and is connected successfully
10 if we go to system properties so we are running
Windows 10 home 64-bit operating system Windows is activated and ready to use so from the 64
gigs forty-six gigs is allocated to
Windows and from that we have 31 gigs free to use so this is the full version of Windows
so let's see how it plays so there you have it guys
that was the chewy high ten plus
I like the option of having both Windows and Android on a dual boot
and it's great how you can change between them quite easily
the performance was great on both Android and Windows
the battery was slightly better on
you can pick this up for 187
I'll leave the links in the description
so you guys can check this product out
let me know in the comments
what you guys think of this product
that's all for this video
don't forget to like and subscribe
thank you so much for watching and I hope you all have a brilliant day
see you in the next one bye you
hi so today
is that the door
um the door access control here
the door control would open so here
yep so once i scan you can see that
okay so basically
with the setup of the relay box and then a door lock and with a torrey software
you can have the control access automated with also temperature scanning results
thank you you
good everyone my name is
Alex and welcome to a new review for today we have
Amazon's latest tablet a $79 Fire HD eight carat
this is the seventh generation
and it's also running the fire
OS 5.44 specs
you have a MediaTek 8163 CPU
this is a quad-core
CPU clocked at 1.5 gigahertz
we also have 1.5 gigs of ram 16
all around the screen
this video was made possible
they give it a fail unique
look if you want to check out any of these cases you can find a link in the video's description
however this is quite normal for a tablet it costs only $79
don't expect any great pictures from that camera
either on the top we have the power button
we also have the micro USB charging port
we have a microphone the 3.5 male audio jack and the volume buttons this tablet also supports
we have a slot for an SD card
SD card in speaking about the internal storage out of the 16
gigs that comes with this device
and how does I hope for so here is a quick sample of how they sound
I think the scores are more than appropriate
the maximum resolution is 720p at 60 frames per second
that's basically the maximum resolution of the tablet
and of course all the videos seem to go fairly smooth as well now you may have noticed that
I mentioned the YouTube app which is not available from the Amazon storage
it's running a modified version of Android called the fire OS and this particular
run tablet has the version five point
Amazon tablets are mostly aimed at Amazon users
because they're so cheap and basically do anything else with it
the fittings app seems to be missing quite a few settings and features from there
we also don't have a GPS unit inside this tablet
so if you hold the home button are like so done come on however since
I'm in Canada
it costs only $79
it offers a lot of value and for that $79 70 could get some much worse on tablets of realistically
of course this could be improved but with that the price would increase
pretty sure they're going to be able to get this for around $50 around
hopefully enjoy this video if you did like it press that like button
don't forget subscribe and I'll see in the next time
thanks for watching
hi this is
Brad Linder with little beauty
and this is the asus memo pad 7 inch tablet
Sirte size and shape
but we've got a sort of soft plastic touch here on the nexus
it's a little bit harder on the memo pad it's also a bumpier texture
there's on the bottom
one advantage is that there's actually a micro
SD card slot
I mean in terms of benchmarks
but you know most uh
Android apps don't actually need a super-fast processor so for basic things like surfing the web
it's it's really not bad
there might be a little bit more lag than you would
experience on a faster tablet but web surfing look works fine
I don't have any real complaints for $150 device
it's impressive that it has a processor at all to be perfectly honest but you know
don't look that different
we'll take a look from the top
they look fine as you sort of start to come down here
the colors get washed out in difficult to see
and what that means is
it's also a lower resolution screen which means that when you're on the home
you might know just a little bit more here with the 1024 by 600 and something else
it's really not a bad tablet so for $149
you might not really be that disappointed
it looks pretty good from others
it really looks a lot less good
you know if you can afford to spend fifty dollars more and get something like the Nexus 7
it's not just the processor but also the the display and
if you sort of pay attention to which angles work well
I think the Nexus 7 is a much better Buy but the memo pad 7 offers acceptable performance
I think for a hundred and fifty dollar tablet this is Brad
Linder with low appearing
and look at these two tablets side-by-side and a video review of the memo pad 7
you can find more details at lil defeating calm
hello everyone in this video
I'll be reviewing this tablet aspire brand code Xcode II and it's a it's meant to be a kids
okay looks like a easy cheap tablet you can find one of these for less than 30 pound
UK currency
you can has a front camera with a low reserve megapixel probably gonna be around team epoch
so rear camera has a 5 megapixel with dual flash there it has built-in mic at the top
it has a micro
he has a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack we've a volume up and down button
it also takes a micro
this has a lot of educational apps
I'm navigating through if they want to go out of the kids own
they have to have a password
600 HD okay
it has kids say browser as well
so yeah as all has that feature
he has anti blu-ray mhm
but you can also extend that with a micro
SD memory card so the battery life is okay
it's not the best you can see
I automatically goes to the kids zone
hold on let me go back
so that's a kids browser
it helps out the kids a lot as well
alright so these are all the features
he has build quality wise another person
thank you for watching my video
please do give a like and subscribe
setup was very easy since it is a screenless
a graphic tablet
all i had to do was install the latest driver which can be downloaded from their website
which you can see on the screen right now
and there's also a dial which has three main functions you can use it to zoom
adjust the brush size
i have decided to recreate the mona lisa in my own
first off one thing i noticed on the tablet is how super sensitive
i don't think it'll be as difficult to get used to this but myself
i'm still not perfect at it
i definitely lack um control with it
i just move closer to the painting
that's my version of zooming in
i just moved closer to the computer screen
but that's not necessarily the best way especially for digital art
luckily for us the zoom function is actually very easy to access on this graphic tablet
for a digital watercolor effect
that's something that i'm not used to so i was very happy with that
i think that makes my workflow a lot faster
i make sure that the brush or the layer is set to a multiply a blend mode
that is pretty much my favorite blend mode when it comes to watercolor effects
and then i brush lightly on the highlighted section
look to the skin
set i downloaded them for free on his website which i will link in the description box below
i downloaded them
there's a wider variety of brushes
there's a smudge tool that also comes in the brush
pack and if it's a watercolor brush pack then
i make sure to select from the watercolor pack and for example
four is very simple and the last one
but in my opinion i believe it completes the entire watercolor look of your digital portraits
so if you're interested i have also placed a link to the watercolor paper texture
it might not be for some people but that's just my experience
i do wish that there was an adjustment for it as well
that's not necessarily my workflow and just to compare that a little bit
another thing that i found slightly inconvenient
us dollars on amazon
so i guess you can't have everything
it is an affordable graphic tablet
it's not perfect but it gets the job done
it is what it is for its price and i think it'll be good for beginners
i created with it
i hope that you liked this video
and the many things i tried to squeeze into this video
hopefully it wasn't too confusing or all over the place
if you are interested in purchasing the gaomon m10k graphic tablet
i will leave their links in the description box
um yeah if you enjoyed this video
i am also welcome to any art products that you would like for me to review and try
thank you so much for watching and i will see you in my next one
hello there YouTube land this is Tom IAM
and this is review the x58 tablet computer
this is a pretty old tablet
that's been sitting around the office for absolutely forever
and we've only just got a charger for it
so his review
it's not softly anyway
it's not like Murphy cases where you can squash them to use them as a pillow
you can tuck the buckle underneath
clip it back in and you can use it to watch videos and stuff with
but we ain't gonna do that
we are going to switch it on
which is oh
we're done eat green early
I lied right
let's take a look at the hardware first full-size USB port
we like that mini HDMI port
we like that as well
this is a very well specs
our tablet for its age
you don't tend to find many
SD card slot will like that as well because micro SD cards are a pain can get lost very easily
nothing on that side and nothing on that side of this thing there
which wouldn't surprise me right on the front we have buttons
that aren't these are actually is resistive touch green and these require pressure
that are capacitive buttons
so no trickery like that there but there's a menu home and back button which we like
it means you'd have to fiddle with the harder buns right
so this is a 7-inch screen with an absolutely useless resolution
i think something like that come
let's show you something
facebook it has their android market which book we get into
yes we can this android market
i'm chinese tablets
tends to be a bit weird
it doesn't think anything's compatible with it
and i don't know if the app store you know
an app store is where you can download stuff from it
i download a dolphin browser which i'll show you yeah hope
I haven't been on any naughty websites
nope just speed dial
let's go on
google seems travel just dressing
they're quite remember that does think it's for shortcuts
yes yes as you can see this
resistive touchscreen tablet has multitouch
let's load up a nice heavy website like I said oops BBC BBC as you can see
Cupid responsiveness isn't the best
GZA mochis is a go to full site button but not as you can see it
that hasn't got a about site version
I don't actually have the full specs for this
just a reference i think
it's around the 600 megahertz processor
that's none of these sorts of things
so that's that now let's try
Angry Birds Angry Birds
I believe came
pre-loaded it's it's been a while since
I've actually downloaded the market and put stuff on it so it might
I might download it myself back and see in android market on a search earlier
so hey ho angry birds as you would probably expect for a tablet
sound all of sound but look
it's fine
the problem is most the graphics have been replaced by squares it might just be corrupted
some reason my hand is bright white as well
there's some really weird lighting stuff going on here and I wholeheartedly apologize
they look lots and lots of white
there's the catapult thing there it's launched a bird
I just won the level so if you enjoy playing not a specialist for the BMP
isn't it only white right
various things on here
YouTube works great for work
settings work several
I've had this for a while so I put several random bits on that is a different market
which is not half as good and there you go if you want a review of Android
i believe about 80 pounds
its ears is quite heavy
i would say it's almost as heavy as the ipad and this is only a 7 inch screen
the belt is absolutely lovely
the materials clearly very high quality absolutely no flex in it whatsoever
you can't press on the screen and make it dip
it's barely worth twenty
sadly did come with a manual manual is written in fairly good
English but it does have some gems such as a one there
please do not place the hot in hot environment especially in summer because it knows
this device do not support watch proof function bad times
I was hoping for some waterproof function
there you go if you want to buy this
because that's what they do
I've install me I'm having a bit
hello you guys and welcome to a very special kind of video as you can see
I've got a package here it says I belong it
though it's addressed to me
this is kind of a product review of sorts
you all right there we go whoo
Yan Liu Yan that Chinese symbol
they actually advertised the damn thing as a
I can already tell you as I always
oh my Jesus you can press this
that's awesome
yes this pen is like the best tablet pen
I have ever held in my in my hands
you don't click these
Keys by mistake definitely
they are definitely made because
I always when I hold my pen
it's like if if some reason you destroy this personal camera there
is this tip of the pen
they are all the same kind
so it's all the same as its s in the tablet itself
it's actually very small
yep this is like half the size of what
I usually use but keep in mind that the actual playing field is only like this big
you're not going to play with this whole thing
this is definitely packaged
way better than with any other tablet
I have I have heft
I have had sorry and I've had like four different
this is my fifth fifth temple
it's very light but as long as you have a big mouse mat
then it's not going to slip anywhere if like for rubber
I don't know how much the the one with the buttons I
I got this one sent to me personally from the company from China
that was very nice of them again
I'm not being paid to do this
review I'm still going to give it a fair and honest opinion so yeah initial reaction is
I am very impressed
definitely in just that it says also on it
you mean you know you know
it's going to be geared to wash it towards it
I assume you're going to draw your
I like it
I like it and the fact that it's so small it's not going to waste any space at all
Krista oh it's on the side you plug it in from the side
I mean you could switch it
you want the right size
but that's just a personal thing
that's my pcs over
there and the damn thing is out there so oh well
I have lots of cords and wires
so that shouldn't be a problem really but it's just something to keep in mind
I actually forgot to mention something about the pin
so yeah just a heads up
yeah you after playing with this for about a week
it's the content better but I understand for the price range that this template has
then if they were to use a wireless a wireless pen then the price would go significantly up
also the size of the tablet
the size is actually pretty nice
it's actually quite hard for me but I think I did pretty okay for them
the amount of time that
I've been playing with this
so it's not really a problem
I guess but I will say that it is absolutely perfect for a beginner
uhnot so if you just started out and you think that a mouse won't do you any good anymore
then by all means go buy this tablet
it's it's cheap it's like what was it 20 euros or 20 dollars or something
it's nothing
it is really good
I guess but twenty dollars
it's like it's it's good
it's a very good tablet for beginners
it is very responsive
Huyen I can't even pronounce your name but good on you you you you
Eddie is an education
centric tablet launched by meters and
this is a very different product from any other
Android tablet you see in the market
there is a special software
our battery which meters claims can give you four hours of continuous usage
we hope you liked this video
this is your host
Rohit Khurana signing off
thanks for watching
hey guys today i just got me a new tablet
what i have here is a juno canvas
20 drawing display tablet pen which is 19 inches
and i'm going to show you guys
the tablet did come with a pin holder
it also came with an adjustable basically display so i can adjust it anytime soon
well basically picture because once you get it
this tablet really feels a lot different
when you're mostly known for just drawing on the non-monitored tablet
it likes wants something
that's a good price
i believe the canvas 20 is actually a really good price for people to use
and it's a really nice thing for people to switch over
before the live you start
I'm sorry to unload this video late
thank you the tablet that
I'm going to leave you is Pablo a 640
it's a small tablet only 6 inches
insured it's cheap and like tablet
that's nice what
sometimes the cursor teleports or stop suddenly it would be very annoying if that happens to me so
I was hoping this tablet doesn't do that anyway
let's move on to what this tablet contains first
the pen design is created
because never seen a table pen like this
I don't know why they made like this
maybe to reduce weight of the pan
I think I'm not sure but I like to spend and the penny is not happy to next
the name of the table is long and thick
while you're aiming really hard otherwise it's okay now
let's see how it works
first of all to use this tablet
you need a tablet driver
I didn't have any technology for easier to the public so personally
like me
there will be no problem with a just in the area
okay that's it
thanks for watching this video and please check the description if you're interested in tablet bye
hi guys this is raju rahman from techtonic dragon
touch a company to be honest
i've not really heard of before
this asked me
one of their aims is to produce affordable electronics
and the fact that this tablet sells for around 100 quid
i tested it out for a few weeks
and if you're interested in finding out what that was like keep watching here
we have the box
it's well designed nothing over the top nice and simple
it's a little worrying when you have to point out
the tablet has a hd screen right there on the box it's a given that in 2020
there's plastic on top of the screen with some instructions
have a read of that if you want
i'm pretty confident
i know how to turn the tablet on so off
you go looks like there's some bubbles here on the screen protector
tempted me to rip it off completely
but i'm glad i wasn't able to some plastic around the back putting the tablet aside
let's see what else is in the box
you've got a three pin uk power plug a usb a2 micro
usb cable come on guys let's say bye bye to these things usbc would have been more preferable
there's a warranty card
good to know you get two years of that and finally the user manual so back to the tablet
you've got a two megapixel front facing camera around the back
an eight megapixel camera complete with an led flash here on the right hand side
you've got a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack the volume rocker
power button and reset here
you have the cover for the micro sd card slot
the cover does feel a little flimsy taking it off also reveals
what seems like both sim card slots
the tablet supports a max micro sd card capacity of 128 gigabytes on the top
right of the k10
you can see the dragon touch branding
and what seems like dual speakers around the bottom
the back of the tablet is actually made of metal
it's called to the touch
i thought the whole thing would be plastic
so that's a pleasant surprise
here's the reason
i'm glad i didn't remove the factory
installed screen protector as you can see the screen
protector loves fingerprints
but leave it on unless you want to scratch up that screen
it doesn't feel too heavy
when you're holding this tablet you can tell
it's a budget tablet
there's no getting away from that but don't get me wrong
it's still better than what i expected
let's quickly go through some of the specifications before moving on to the rest of the review
it's got 10.1
b g n and ac no wi-fi 6 here
but what did you expect
also one thing that dragon touch likes to point out
is that when it comes to wi-fi this device also supports the 5 gigahertz span
that's certainly a good thing
the 10.1 inch ips display isn't full hd with its 1280x800 resolution at just slightly above 720p
it's good enough for consuming content on netflix and youtube
it may not be super crisp or sharp
but it's hard to complain for too long
that's a little odd is the display refresh rate
the tablet is running on android 9.0
aka android pie
there's no fancy skin running atop they pretty much stuck to something close to stock vanilla
no bloatware whatsoever
so that's a good thing
all that means is the software
doesn't slow down the tablet
considering this is a budget tablet it was a wise choice to keep the software as light as possible
remember to clear applications
you're not using browsing the web or even scrolling through the catalog of movies and tv shows on
netflix isn't too bad
but you'll definitely notice some choppiness
it plays smoothly without any issues
multitasking isn't something you'd expect to work
you can see
i'm using both youtube
and the chrome browser side by side here
it's working perfectly
whilst the 1.3 gigahertz quad-core processor and 2 gigabytes of ram is good enough for basic tasks
graphics looked terrible and it was so laggy it was just unplayable to be honest
i'm surprised i have ran at all but the performance was exactly what i expected
graphically intensive games are the way to go with this tablet
as long as you don't try and push it too hard and taper your expectations
it does a pretty good job
i was quite surprised that i was able to play hungry
shark without many hiccups
so gaming is something you'll definitely be able to do with the k10
don't have great cameras but if you have to know the cameras on
this tablet aren't great
even from a tablet perspective
low light shots are bad
they're very dark and lack detail
pictures taken outside during the day are kind of okay
they're not too bad compared to the pictures
i took with the galaxy tab s5v
the video also isn't that great it lacks in vibrance and clarity
certain things are overexposed but to be honest
i feel
i'm being a bit too hard with the k10
look it costs 100 quid
it's a tablet and it can take pictures and record video as i mentioned earlier
no one really cares about the cameras on a tablet
let's not be around the bush
it's pretty bad the max volume isn't loud at all
you get a max db of 19.8
and i could have tolerated that
have the quality of the sound being better
it sounds very tinny
the speakers remind me of those singing musicals birthday cards i got a while ago
it's completely flat
fortunately the tablet does come with a 3.5 millimeter standard headphone jack and bluetooth
so you'll want to make use of some wired or wireless headphones to get a better audio experience
i left a live tv channel streaming on youtube after seven hours of continuous streaming
the k10 had six percent of battery life left
do i recommend this tablet
why even watching this video
it's fast enough
it does most of the things you need it to do without any issues browsing the web consuming media
although not all games it can run most casual games fairly well
basically you can do all the things
most people do on a tablet yes
you know during my initial use of the k10
i thought i wouldn't be able to recommend this to anyone
the speakers aren't great
the display isn't amazing
everything you need it to do
it just works well enough and those are the key words
then yes i do highly recommend this tablet
this has been raju rahman from techtonic
thanks for watching
and don't forget to check out these other videos too
i don't wanna fight
welcome to my review of the view
max s7000 one tablet price-wise
I could not find any actual video reviews on this product not too shabby
there's not too much to get excited about in the box
there is a simple USB cable but there is also tiny mini USB to USB cable
probably soap that you and your boyfriend can share gay photos together
there is also no instruction manual
apparently max view cannot translate Chinese to English a quick glance at the box
it has an amazing airplane graphic
it better play that or I am going to be pissed of course it's made in China
it smells like it came from China
holy said that a car
just drive through the background
1.2 gigahertz you've got to be bullshitting me
you cheap live look dumb 1.5 goddamn gigahertz
look at that
aluminum is not plastic
that blob core video processor
you say it has
max customer service
they did a phenomenally shitty job of answering emails
if they can't make a god damn tablet you have to wonder how shitty their video cards are also
so well how's it going
i'm mark duffy
welcome to my channel and as you can guess from the intro
i'm going to be talking about graphics tablets
do you really need them as a photographer
and what are the benefits of having a graphics tablet okay
let's break into this massive debate
it's up there with apple versus mac and canon versus nikon or sony
answer this it's just personal preference
what works for you may not work for someone else
my tree backgrounds studied music
in college
self-taught and graphic design self-taught photography
uh what i can tell
you is from an audio standpoint
so i've been using a trackball mouse since 2004.
when i was studying music in college
that's when i got a trackball mouse and i've loved it since and i get great great results
i use trackball modes even into graphic design
i was the only one in my team
ever to use a trackball mouse
that's another thing anyway
he ended up switching back to his standard mouse because his hand was sore
i've had issues in the past with drumming with bad technique
i still have it
i've a lump on my wrist here
it's a collagen buildup in my tendons
it'll actually be quite sore and painful like to stretch it out
so the ideas of using the mouse that could cause carpal tunnel in my right hand
which is my
that's that's my main hand for drummond and everton
that's um no so i always opted for the easier way you know i just found
the trackball makes quite easy
let's get into what we're actually here to talk about
and that is the xp pen deco pro the deco pro line have two options a small and a medium
there's not much difference at all some of the features on these is that it's powered by usbc
this is finished lovely on the side and wraps around to the back with a brushed aluminium
finish so it it has a little bit it has a bit of weight to it has a bit of a premium feel to it
if we compare the design of the pen you will notice that it's almost the same as wacom
it looks basically like a wacom pen
uh even down to the fact that it's battery free
it does not need any batteries
which is fantastic
you don't need to charge
you have to worry about any of that
it works every time it has a customizable buttons on it
which is the pressure sensitivity
both of these are offering over 8 000 levels of pen pressure
i use none of that
i don't care for the pressure sensitivity
i forgot to use the customizer buttons
i'd ever set up on it and i stopped using them
went back to using the keyboard
and um yeah i just
i buy a graphics tablet literally for the accuracy
when you're using it and that's what's so important about it
that is the defining thing when you're doing a lot of exposure blending and dodging and burning
you want to be accurate
it's just such an easy way to work
it's accurate and that's why i bought a graphics habit
that's why i think
yet we settle for substandard mouse
get into the see if it see if it is something for you but there is a learning curve with these
so when you do buy you do need to give yourself a little bit of time to get used to it
i use the pen when i want to use the trackball mouse
i use the trap
almost i don't i don't decide that
oh no i've got the i've got the pen
i'm only going to use the pen like i know
i didn't like it at all
how i edit my photos
so who do
i think this is geared for this is really geared for the people who not
just edit the photos in lightroom but go into photoshop and do more extensive heavy-handed editing
you can do this kind of editing in lightroom
um i don't really over like doing it
i will do all my dodging and burning in photoshop
it's as intense as an artist
you shouldn't be settling for just a mouse
you should be looking to make sure that your work is perfect
your work is outstanding and i think the xp pain is a great option for you
it's not an entry-level graphics tablet
i think it's up there on par with wacom
it's just an affordable option
it's a third-party affordable option that you don't have to put the expense into
i just want to say xp pen did not give me this graphics tablet
they don't even know i'm doing this video like i said already i've owned two of these
this is my second one
i've owned this literally is my own personal one
these are my personal thoughts on this
i'm extremely impressed and happy with the company
i hope you enjoyed this
i would highly recommend the xp pen deco pro small
it's one toward the price of the wacom equivalent and it offers everything that wacom are offering
they're not for everyone
not everyone can get it can get around that coordination issue so do give it
its time to get used to it
ring that bell to get notified for the next time i post a video
i post a video every thursday and follow me on my social medias
you'll find me everywhere on mark duffy photography whether that's facebook instagram
sometimes a little bit of twitter and until the next time later gators you

Thank You bubby
thank you good bye open
fatherhood he's been there bye-bye
they've got like a whole bunch of these various models different sizes
this one is the mid-7th got a couple of different features
as far as the other two 7-inch tablets
one has a resistive screen
where this one has
it has a capacitive screen
that's multi-touch it's got 5-point capacitive touch
and this one also has a camera up here in the corner
so that's how a couple of differentiating factors from the other 7-inch
Kobe tablets so as far as Hardware
we've got a USB port right here and it also has hosting capabilities even comes with the adapter
actually we've got mini HDMI port
there's a microphone right there headphone jack
we just got some volume buttons right there and then the back is pretty plain
we just got a little speaker up here in the corner
so we've got this little button right here this
I thought it was a home button
but it's actually a back button and like
I said that got a little camera up here
the quality is not very good
it's a point three megapixel
it's supposed to be for video chatting whatnot the camera
it doesn't take very good pictures
they're pretty much black and white
almost you can adjust it but the camera
I would say is pretty bad as far as cameras go so basically like I said it runs Android 4.0
right here as you can see that gives us lots of options for customization
we got different widgets
I found that it's actually surprisingly adequate as you can see stuff
they smooth even with a live wallpaper on here
the app drawer loads pretty smoothly
so as far as the processor goes as far as single
core processors go
it is a pretty good processor
obviously dual core is gonna get you some more speed but from what
I've tested it's pretty decent
actually we've got some different games on here and they work well in
Reverse space of course so this is what the game I have tried on here
that works well
so games like fruit
ninja work too
of course the touchscreen it works pretty well the capacitive touchscreen on the Coby
it's one of his strengths
actually okay as you see out here there's no Google market new Play Store
I went ahead and download a couple other app stores
we've got the Amazon App Store in the one mobile market on here between those three app stores
because the amazon app store
they have a lot of apps
you can get like netflix through here
you can also get like your daily free paid app
it works for the most part some of the other apps
I got it like I got YouTube through there
I did here with Google Maps
let me go ahead and show you some of the video playback like
I said Netflix does work so Netflix runs
well one thing with the mini
so that's kind of annoying
it doesn't get rid of that like what it does with the other tablets
it'll fit at that screen so let me go ahead and show you some of the other apps
I've got on here so one of the failings I think with this tablet is the screening
it's not going to show up on here at all
it's got the 800 by 480 resolution screen
which is pretty typical for budget tablets
I really don't care for it that much
you've got the different widgets but you can have weather widgets on here
you can move them around and that's a little gallery widget for the pictures
there's some of the stock photos that it comes with the biggest deal
the biggest problem with this tablet is the battery life
look at the battery
life had probably gone down 15% since
I've been doing this review
that is the failing with this tablet
it's the main thing that holds it back from being a decent buy
I in my opinion
you're lucky if you get five hours of battery life out of this thing
it's not a bad budget tablet
so that's just been sort of my take on the COBE cryos 7 inch tablet
check out the e-book reader com
I've got this full written review right here with the budget information
so thank you for watching
hey everyone i hope you're all well today i'm going to be doing
we're kind enough to send me another tablet this time
it's the deco mini seven
look it's like a really nice box
i think is to celebrate their 15th anniversary
but yeah like so first impressions
i like the packaging
i don't that means nothing to me
i don't really know what a good comparison is so the usb usb interface
which is that's quite a lot
i think the most i've ever had on a tablet is four so it's quite a lot
okay oh once again
it's quite useful
i'll take the actual tablet out of the wrapper in a second
i like that i think
i should have maybe open the packaging before i start filming okay
this pen is really nice
yeah i like this pen
i have no complaints cable
spare nibs and there's quite a few of them so that's always good
um you know for different usb port types and to fit in android and things like that
that's good this little thing
somebody on the other unboxing video
i did commented saying it's to help remove nibs
so that's i guess that's all that is awesome
i don't see like the quick start guide
let's i'll read it later but okay
i used to use like a while ago
so that's quite like yeah
i think that's a workable size and for me
i prefer smaller tablets anyway
so yeah you can see all the the shortcut buttons they're round
i've not had one with round buttons before i don't know that will make a difference
don't want your tablet sliding around
yeah i mean first impressions
i'm happy with all little things
there's also a download guide on that same page if you need any help and click on the software
and you'll have a zip file which you need to extract
it's no problem
that's how easy it is and it'll do it
and then you'll have the little icon for the tablet pen
it's really quick
it literally takes a few minutes to do
it's great
um the default settings were fine
i probably could have used them but i felt i wanted it a little bit more sensitive
i guess so
you might want to play around with that but it's no big deal
the sensitivity is so easy to adjust
it's you know it's not a problem so please
oh my god it fits perfectly i was yeah
it's brilliant um
the tablet itself is seven by four inches as the tablet as a whole
obviously the actual drawing area is a bit smaller than that
um but in my opinion this is like the perfect size tablet
i think it'd be quite good for that as well
um the pen is very responsive pressure wise
i like okay
i had to adjust it slightly to suit me but it was otherwise fine
it wasn't any less sensitive as far as i could tell than like more expensive tablets
i'd use the larger tablets
there's nothing to put it in like
that is the one criticism i have with this tablet like everything else is absolutely brilliant
i think all the deco series actually comes with a free download of artrage lite
which if you're a beginner artist that would be great
it saves you shedding out a load of money for something
you don't know how you're going to get along with
i didn't find it lacking particularly in anything that i needed
low-cost tablet that didn't take up too much space
just in case something happened to my ipad
then i could just whip out this little tablet and this is like perfect for that
in terms of cost
i believe the deco mini 7 is 49.99 from xp pen uk
and i do yeah
i think it's worth that price genuinely
i really do
love this tablet
any feedback is always appreciated
and thank you so much for watching
i hope this video is useful for anyone
trying to find a new tablet or wondering about this particular type of tablet
i hope you have an amazing day
i hope you're staying safe and are well and everything else
so yes thank you bye
earlier this month
this tablet was ready to go plug it in
download the drivers from the website
delete the old tablet drivers then restart the PC
I pulled up paint tool
Pro I had to push a little more to get the same line
wait and while at first this is annoyance
that's just how much more potential for line control
this little battery list pen had previously with my way on tablet
the drivers would have issues with paint tool
no more uninstalling paint tool
Sai and the tablet drivers every day just to get the tablet to work out of the box
the tablet came with a paper disc
telling you how to get the drivers from the website
action set up while the touchscreen idea is cool on paper
I find myself rubbing my arm against the buttons
all the time and accidentally deleting undoing swapping to erase or swapping to the cut tool
the only difference between the two would be that the
making good for use on your regular-sized desks
the tablet works with all the artwork programs
I tested it on including paint tool Sai Photoshop clip studio paint and carita
and while they did ask me personally to review their tablet out of the blue from nowhere which
I genuinely appreciate
I do have the give him some good pointers
the pen itself feels light
it's just a hassle
I really don't like that
it'd be much better if they were just solid buttons that
this helps a lot with wire management and
I super appreciate being able to keep my desk clear while I'm drawing so overall what
I recommend the vaycay 30 drawing tablet
yes actually if you're looking for a good low-cost tablet to get started into digital artwork the
Bakke is really good
I had the pleasant experience of enjoying how smooth the pen drags across the tablets face
the pen is lightweight and doesn't require a constant battery charging like the Hawaiian Age 6/10
Pro does even though the battery lasts quite a long time on though aged 610 bro
some people have apprehensions about battery less pens which being
I've only ever had these two specific models of tablet
hey what's going on guys the CTA praten back here again today
we're gonna be taking a look at Walmart's all new on surf tablet pro
this is the 10.1 inch version
and they also make an 8 inch version this one retails for $129 and the 8 inch version is 99
we have a 10.1
you're gonna receive a few coupons like $10 off your grocery purchase
you also get three months of
Vudu free but I'm interested in the tablet itself
it's definitely got some heft to it
CPU on the front here
it's got all your instructions you need
we also get our user manual
USB type-c cable and a 1 amp 5 volt charger now
it looks like they have their proprietary keyboard dock connector
I'm not sure if they're selling this yet
a USB type-c charger port micro SD card slot compartment our power button and our volume rocker
now that's pretty much it for buttons on the unit but up top
we do have dual stereo speakers and I have tested these out
they actually sound pretty good for a cheap tablet aspect schoo
it's looking a lot better than the 2019
non pro versions for the cpu
we have the mediatek and four cores at two gigahertz for the GPU
we have the power
VR rogue GE
8320 it does
OpenGL and Vulcan
so it is built into this version of Android 10
that comes pre-loaded on the tablet and we also get three gigs of RAM now
that definitely doesn't seem like much but with these cheaper tablets
they're usually shipping with two gigs
so that extra gig will help out in the long run the display is a 10.1 inch 1920 by 1200
aren't that bad
they're not as good as let's say the new Amazon fire 10 tablet but overall
I think it's a pretty decent screen
now that's all that
I've tested in it
it's a pretty clean
are the cameras on these tablets because most of them are garbage
both of them are really bad
I had to run some benchmarks on both of them on the left-hand side
we have the new on tablet on the right hand side
the 2019 Amazon fire 10 HD this is Geekbench 4 unfortunately I couldn't get Geekbench
5 Orion 2 to to run on the Amazon Fire HD
so we do have a significantly more powerful
1080p 60fps video is no issue whatsoever
we have those dual stereo speakers up top and it does get pretty loud so YouTube works really
well let's go ahead and test out
Disney Plus now keep in mind
you're not gonna get any 4k content on this
Disney Plus loads right up
you can download this directly from the Google Play Store
I also tested Amazon Prime video and Hulu but here we have some Netflix
just to give you a look
Netflix YouTube through Disney
Plus it'll work out just fine so with video playback out of the way
so first up we have Minecraft Pocket Edition
I did install the beta version just so I could see the FPS up at the top here
I'm set to 8 chunks
have a bunch of stutters
but this one here seems pretty smooth here
we have
King of Fighters all-star and performance here isn't great
Pub G is really well optimized
I've been able to run this on the $50 Amazon fire tablets and here performance really
isn't that bad
we're at the lowest settings with the lowest frame rate
quite well here
testing out on
this tablet was emulation
it's gonna work fine all of those run at full speed
but when we move up to the harder to emulate systems like even dreamcast using redream
i've run into issues even with some of the easier to emulate games like Sonic Adventure 2
we just can't maintain that 60 FPS threshold even with an easier to emulate game like this one
let's move up to a harder one like
Dead or Alive - and see how it performs
I'm still set to as low as I can go here and we're getting an average of 45 FPS out of this one
let's take a look at some
PSP emulation using ppsspp
this is a really easy one to run
Soulcalibur broken destiny
it's pretty bad no
2019 has more power than this
but it's running
Amazon fire OS which is something
Plus and Netflix ready to go
but that's it for this one
I was hoping for some better emulation performance
but that's what we get with a hundred and thirty dollar tablet really appreciate you guys watching
thanks for watching
I still remember when Isaac eat
I used to draw something on drawing paper whenever I had time
let's try this one thin and lighted this graphics
tab fills excellent enhance
they will not provide you any driver
CD but they will provide you with a round shaped paper same size as a CD at first class
there are top of the class tabs available for around 40 to 50 cakes
but this one right here is more than enough to start with
I hope you guys enjoyed this video
if you did give it a thumbs up subscribe and as well as thanks for watching
I'll see you guys next time till then good bye
hi guys it's been such a long time since we last did a tablet review
so that's what we're going to do today
also i cut off all of my hair because why not so fluffy now okay
so today
we're going to look at the xp pen innovator 16 and this is the anniversary edition
it has eight express keys as well as two in one dial express ring
i'll show you how that works
it supports tilt on the stylus
the tablet is less than a centimeter tall height
and let me just and let me just start off by saying that you will need a computer for this tablet
this is not a standalone tablet
let's start with an unboxing
bring it along with your laptop and draw from anywhere
the stylus is battery free
and you can power the tablet directly through your computer's usb port
is the familiar cylinder which contains the stylus
but we'll get back to that in a moment in this white box here
you will find some anniversary items from xp pen along with a drawing glove
if you're into wearing those i personally don't use them but if you need it there you go
you also get this pretty cool pen
that actually feels really nice to ride with
are all of the power supplies this one here is the actual power supply
now let's take a look at the stylus in one of these caps on the cylinder
you'll find eight additional pin laps unscrew the other cap
and you'll find this stylus
its design has been slightly updated and it has a really nice rubber surface
so it doesn't slide away from your grip comparing it to the stylus of the xp pen artist 22r pro
the main difference is the shape at the bottom of the stylus and the nip on the innovators
the stylus has over 8 000 pressure levels and it supports up to 60 degrees
it has only one level as i mentioned earlier
the innovator 16 display itself is wrapped in two layers of protective foil
that you should remove first
i'm disengaging my party mode because it's time to set up this baby
the cables are designed as a 3 in 1 solution
that's the only cable going into the tablet
you can choose either windows ios or a beta for linux
i recommend you restart your computer before doing anything else
when it's attached
i usually do that
you can adjust the tablet's brightness on the two buttons on the side of the tablet
i like to work with it on full brightness because it brings out the colors better
here's a little sped up run through of me setting up the 8 express keys
i like to have a shortcut for flipping my canvas
a color picker brush eraser
how the shortcuts
react to me using the dial
the second dial is the blank one in the middle which is controlled by touch
this was one of the tests
i was most concerned with because all of my other xp pen tablets
i've had and that's free now
let's check out how much parallaxing we can detect for
one the innovator 16 the parallaxion is so tiny you barely notice it at all
it wasn't really necessary at all
it might be a bit different
if you're interested sign up to release the hero tier before october 1st 2020 to receive the term
that this video is in
it will be uncut and almost at real time so first of all you can also use this tablet
my general impression of the screens quality was really good
i didn't really think about it anymore
i especially love that
they continue to use these diaries
i like big screens
the innovator 16 is by the time
i'm publishing this video
the innovator 16 is in my opinion the best competitor and alternative to wacom cintiq
i know a lot of other tablets out there
and that means that this tablet right now has a discount on it
so from now and until their anniversary ends you can get the innovator 16 for 399
i think i have concluded what i wanted to conclude
this is my new main tablet for the time being
i'm really happy about it
and thanks to xp pen for sending it over for my honest and personal way to review stuff
i hope you enjoyed it
found it informative and if you have any questions feel free to put them in the comments
i'll do what i can to get back to as many people as possible
Oh welcome to
dad doesn't today we are looking at the nah
BSE this is a 7-inch tablet for kids ages 6 and up
here's the cool thing about it
$79 they pack a whole lot into this
it's a 7 inch tablet it's running Android 6.0
but the real key to it is all the software that comes installed on it has the
we're going to jump in look at some of that
but we'll quickly take you through the hardware of it and then really focus on the software so
because we think that's very important in the kids tablet for this reason
kids will do this
and they'll do this
they'll do that so you know key thing
I'm gonna do now is just take it off so I can show you the tablet like I said
I you know it's not going to blow you away with any of the tech specs on it is running Android 6.0
but like we said the big thing is the blue morpho
is that just quickly
just take you through this to give you a little example here okay so
Tony a great job
you've earned stars and this keeps growing so
love this that you know
it really all is educational and then they throw the game element onto it
lessons grows with you quizzes
also we want to show you some other things
this dream pro studio so they can draw anime
publish all this stuff in there
um and that's it when you get this you get over 400 different games
apps educational experiences loaded onto it so again
it's one of those things for 79 bucks you know maybe during the holidays
they pulled out of the box and they can start doing stuff
I'm we're gonna show you in a bit you can
you can go to the normal
you've got the camera the gallery you know
English math social studies have all of that there
let me go back and find that for you as well so this treasure box here kind of a neat idea here
we're going to call up
let's do the chore list
but what you can do
is you can tie chores to rewards and that this kind of not be points in dollars they get
let me just allow this and allow this so you can see it and so what you can do is you know
take a shower here
what they're doing is actually can then earn
Noby points and you can do different things
you know
get some toy or something like that
they do enough chores
they get enough points and this is actually being sold through
I will unlock that
you know toy you want if you do these chores so you do these various things
so that's a neat aspect of it
I think that gamification is really going to work with kids
so that's a cool idea
I just want to show you that and just want to show here
this is the treasure box and basically this is kids curated apps
have all been curated specifically for kids and you can
do things like unlock
if there's something which is maybe a little bit less educational more fun
they want here again with those knobby coins
if they do their chores the amount of time they spend
that's good - let's say kind of in a pinch
you need a tablet to do some stuff and your kids have the knobby
SC you can just unlock it
go into this parent mode and then this is going to look very much like any standard
um overall do also want to say this
well the things which we really like about
is that right out of the box
they've got all these different apps educational experiences and that a safe environment
I can have this set
where after a p.m.
no more knobby
you know it's only available between the hours of 4:00 and 8:00 p.m.
so rather than kids constantly asking you can
I use the tablet can I use it
it'll just be locked out
you can also have things kind of based on what they do
unlock it and earn extra time
I think that's great
I think parents going to like that
they've been doing a lot of this
lots of that
so the reporting aspect is pretty neat and something you want to get an
A standard tablet then
the other big part of it is just kind of the safe environment
it's nice to be able to hand them
this tablet one because of the rubberized a bumper around it
do you know this animator drawing all of that
you can have your photos you can access the web all that stuff but in a safe environment
well and parents going to feel a little bit better about their screen
time when they're using this come on over to dance comm well the full review over on the site
all right this video won't be like the others
i do
hello it's me and i think you're wondering why am i showing my ugly hands
well that's because i have um well wait
i have this xp pen
send it to me and i'm gonna give it a review so let's just get to it right
this is the box that it comes and i think it's pretty looking
i don't know what else to say about box but i like that
it has the specifications on the back
so let's open this and see what it has on the inside
this is the tablet and it's very nicely wrapped it has a sticker and it is very cute
i tried to take it off to keep it
it didn't work
the startup guide extra nibs
and the little thingy that used to take out the nibs from the pen which i think
it's really cool to have the pen
i think it looks good
it looks way more professional than the other one i had
we didn't wacom into a small um i think the design is like very cool
i'm not sure about um the little bump thing
it just feels kind of weird
but maybe that's because i'm just used to wacom um the cable
it looks pretty good
uh you're gonna use that with your phone
you're gonna connect your tablet to your phone and i'll show you how to do that
okay inside there is a thank you for supporting us card
there's great guide on how to start up a warranty policy
and uh yeah i
i don't really need that
uh what i needed to do
next was download the driver but i just went to their site on the note and downloaded
it was very easy
i did not need to restart the computer just to make it work
you can also set
i um set it to work software on clip studio bay because it just makes prettier lines
um the pressure levels work great
it felt weird to use so much fresher on the pad tablet
i'm not used to that
i have been drawing for years on a screen tablet
don't don't judge me okay so i tried it on with my phone to me personally
um it works on abyss paint sketchbook and medibang
i tried doing a little bit of speed paint
it is quite hard for me but it didn't feel like a pen was acting strange at all
it was just mainly my fault for not being able to get used to it
okay so i used this tablet for a couple of weeks and it did
not glitch did not do anything stupid like the driver crashing or anything
anything else about this
i really like that
you don't have to use a keyboard for that okay so i did a speed paint
i'm always used drawing on screen tablets so if it looks weird that is just my fault
okay while this speed paint is going on
you can do that or just
use it as a mouse personally
i ended up using this for my online classes for my phonetics class in which we need to like
how do you write
and she was like
oh i use a graphical tablet and i was like happy that the teachers knew about that
and then i found out two other teachers are using it
it's not expensive at all
it's just so much better quality than what i used to have and another advantage
i think that you can use this as a teacher and a student
you can use this as an artist or a photographer
i even tried to use it on osu
it felt good even though they told me not to use it
i asked the lady from xp pen and they advised me to not use it with osu but i did anyway
i tried it on multiple drawing abs
uh clip studio paint paint tool sai version one and two
i tried it on photoshop
i tried it on
adobe animate i tried it on rafael paga and medibang
another advantage would be that you can just take it anywhere with you so disadvantages
there are not many actually and i'm gonna just say that with the phone option
it is a little bit weird to get used to it
i'm just gonna keep it simple so one
it is a great tablet for a beginner artist
two great price and great quality
three great diversity
yeah and i think that is about it
that's my whole review on this deco mini 7 tablet
so check out the description and leave a like or comment
ask me questions you can ask me anything and i'll see you on another video
i guess bye
hey guys how's it going daniel here today
we're taking a look at the new amazon fire tablet now
i'm actually really excited for this thing
that would kind of mimic the same thing that the more expensive electronics would do
this tablet retails for 50 and as far as specs go
this has a 1024 by 600 resolution
if you have seen a lot of retina displays in ultra hd displays
if you want to load a bunch of movies up onto this before a road trip or anything like that now
this guy also has two cameras
now all that aside
let's talk hardware of course for 50
it also has a nice heft to it which doesn't make it feel too cheap now
the plastic on the back does get dirty quite easily and so does the front display
now oddly enough
this tablet has every single thing on the top of the tablet
so we have the lock button
we have the micro usb we have the mic
we have the volume jack and then we have the volume rocker
a good thing about that is
that amazon has definitely improved the software
we of course get the amazon app store which has a lot of apps
now you can download things like netflix
now now this does come pre-installed with a ton of apps
i think the only reason they included the pictures is for that kind of gimmicky thing
in this so you can add like little stickers to pictures and things
i think that some people will find that kind of amusing from time to time especially kids now
when it's loading all the files up it does lag a little bit but after that it's all flawless
it doesn't get to the point where it's not bearable but it's definitely worth mentioning now
the great thing about this tablet is that anything you open up
it opens up as it should and at no point
are you reminded that you only paid 50 for this tablet
and i think that's very important
you want to feel like you still got 50 worth of money and this is it
this actually manages to make those 50 dollars worth it now
as far as battery life goes it actually takes quite a bit of time to charge
it takes nearly four hours to charge but the battery itself is actually quite good
i left this on my desk
a whole 24 hours and it only lost close to 10 percent which is really good
or you know actually want to use this tablet so first off
we got the elderly
this is a really good starter tablet
fire with that said this is also great for kids
this is a great tablet
this has a ton of things
actually if you wanted to create some documents on here and write up some papers
it won't be very efficient or quick or easy to do
but it's definitely doable
they kind of look cool from time to time
that's pretty much it for this video
it was just kind of to show you
thank you guys for watching this video
and i'll catch you guys in the next one goodbye
what's going on guys the CTA Prime back here again today
we're gonna be taking a look at the all-new 2019
Amazon fire seven tablet
this is actually
Amazon's ninth generation 7-inch tablet
we got a nice little spec bump here plus some new colors like with all
Amazon fire tablets inside of the box
you get the tablet itself power brick and USB cable I opted to pick up the green version
this is known as sage but they offer three other colors
we have our basic black plum sage which
I have here an Twilight blue
I'm kind of diggin
these lighter colors here
that's it for this one
did bump the specs up a little bit
unfortunately they didn't add any more
RAM which would definitely help out this little 7 inch tablet but we do get a better CPU
this is the same CPU that's in the Amazon fire
eight and so mediatek mt6752 one gigabyte of ddr4
8 version this is a 1024 by 600
IPS display and the viewing angles are amazing
I don't think it's taking full advantage of it
the download speeds are really good for a cheap tablet like this bluetooth
4.1 in the operating system is fire
OS C point three zero which is based on Android 7.1.2
I personally haven't had enough time to test this out
but they claim up to seven hours of reading video or music on a single charge
I'll leave links for that in the description so with the looks and specs out of the way
let's go ahead and see how this thing performs
this is coming in on the very low end of the scale
same thing with 3d mark here
I was only able to run ice storm
now it's time to move over to some native
Android gaming unfortunately pub G would not run on here
this is actually the first time
I've ever seen this
I've been able to run this on a ton of different devices
I also tried the lite version
but it wouldn't even start up so the first game
I'm gonna test here is minecraft
crap is definitely playable on the new 2019
fire 7 tablet
I'm not a big mobile gamer but I did find this on trending this is fury survival
I am using an Xbox one controller here connected over Bluetooth pairs right up with the tablet
Prime video just wanted to show you a work in here
buffering is pretty quick as long as you have a decent connection and it plays fine next up
we'll move over to YouTube now
now if you want to install
Kodi on here use a custom build or play files from the SD card
that are gonna run fine like Mario Kart rampage or super
mario 64 as you see here
we're getting a constant 30
I'm still using that Bluetooth Xbox controller and I'm using retroarch with PC SX rearmed
we'll try one more here this is
Tekken 3 again really great performance pretty much
all of the lower end consoles are going to run fine on here from
Atari 2600 up to ps1 including some n64 games
here's SNES and I'm still using retroarch with snes9x runs at full speed
FBA this tablet is perfect for it so like I mentioned the price on the new fire
seven tablet is $49.99
expect this to go down on
Amazon Prime day
now if you're looking to buy one of these tablets just for video playback music and ebooks
Netflix Hulu prime video
you could even install
Kodi if you want to so that's pretty much it for this video guys
I will leave a link in the description
it was a video
I created on the fire 8
I would just stay away from this
if you have any questions
let me know in the comments below
it'd be really cool
if you could hit that like button
maybe subscribe to the channel but like always
thanks for watching you
we are trying to buy this new tablet from wailmer
it's a $28 starter tablet
which is a really good price
ok battery life only 4 hours that means after 4 hours
you need to charge
ok it's a blue navy
tablet has a camera but it doesn't have flash on the camera
it's important to mention that and also have a external memory card slot
here the headset adapter of course volume and the charging port
see okay but this one has a common one
they use the one day
it's about 16 different languages
okay so you can see on the screen different language that you can use on this phone
is there any other
hundreds tablet or smartphone has and the display is this resolution
let's go to menu settings in you go so seeing mode
so here you can set everything to aromatic and so since
I don't have any any flash so you can actually set as a nine

hello everyone i'm going to review the xp pen deco 01 v2
i want to give a big thank you to xpen for giving me this
these are the contents of the box
i didn't film an unboxing footage or anything so i'm just gonna show you these first of all
we have this pen which is good for your grip
it has these two buttons just for switching between pen and eraser mode the nib is really good too
and it's not that firm nor is it too bouncy
so that's cool over here
we have spare pen nibs for this
and this is the main cord for the tablet for connecting it to my laptop
these are two adapters
is the main boy over here
this is the tablet screen protector and this is a cute little
thank you card along with the instruction manuals
this is what it looks like
when it's all set up as i said this thing holds the pen and this is what it looks like
i also forgot to mention these buttons in the previous footage
i don't know if other tablets do this but i think it's pretty cool one thing
the pen pressure works really nicely and there were no issues with the driver
and that's all i have to say
the link to where you can get this tablet will be provided in the description below
thanks so much for watching and i'll see you in the next video bye
this is Lisa for mobile tech review
let's take a look at the device
it's an attractive looking product
it's got the tapered sides here which is a lot like the Dell Streak 5 on AT&T
this guy has a so-so display and a plastic non removable back
who sees no screws here and for no access to the battery
here is actually speaker on each side for stereo
that's can do things like HDMI out with an optional accessory
and this side
we have a door
you have a front-facing video camera here for her video
that's all gone here for
Froyo but you do get the big widgets here
the launcher is it's fairly handy over here
this is your most recently used applications
and you've got the weather embedded over here
you can either plug in a location you use your
GPS to do that
and you can set up social networking over here this will do either
Facebook or Twitter
you got the music player over here
which shows album covers
if they're available it just takes you right into the music player and there again
as mentioned the second instance of the social networking widget up
here in case you might have both
and when you're on this screen you can also switch
the email if you've got it set up and adjusted all-purpose Android window so this is nice too
Froyo and tap over here you see all of your applications
they are arranged in pages like so in alphabetical order and yes
it does work in portrait mode as well thanks some of the widgets actually look better in portrait
Magwitch you can see more of your social networking updates if you have them loaded over here
for example the buns of course are obviously designed for landscape orientation
you can see here
they are facing down and missing just like with the speak
five is the standard
Android search button so we have three on four standard Android buttons
this is very fast
what's not so good about this
is the 800 by 480 pixel display
that's the same resolution as a high-end smartphone
the text is really not sharp
you can see some pixelation and photos
the pixels are just basically too large and beyond that the viewing angles are up
it's something like a tablet
Buy and Fry's in other places like this next book 7-inch ebook reader and Android tablet
GT which runs pretty nicely
actually this is pretty good for gaming
it's a rebranding a mobi teething and we'll take a look at that
TV channel
so that's the live TV app
that's included there which seems to be pretty much included on every
Android phone right now
I get to hear the speakers do performance again
the game is pretty good also web browsing with
we're checking out
the web browser here again is 800 by 480 resolution
so it's the same thing you'll see on your smart phone
they're serving from their front page
so it's a little bit me but the frame rates are absolutely fine better yet
it doesn't bog down the device to a flash 10.1
can on some slower CPU to Android devices
so that's the Dell Streak 7 it's available now on t-mobile from $1.99 with contract it is

so that's pretty good it also
it's also durable protective case and protects the edges
it also provides a lot of grip as well so while you're holding it
go that design here
the main screen is the scratches you will get on the screen protector
that's the main thing about kids tablet

thank you for watching my video
please do give a like and subscribe
ladies and gentlemen welcome back
this video is brought to you guys by dragon touch and we're taking a look at their notepad 102.
this is a full-on 10-inch tablet that runs android
you also get bluetooth 5.0 wi-fi that supports 5g wi-fi and 2g wi-fi and gps built into this
but i think my favorite thing about this is the design it just looks so sleek
it's really really thin
has a little bit of weight to it
i'm not going to lie but you know what it gives it
more of a premium feel because it does have pretty solid specs
the uh display itself is also really really nice but i think my favorite thing is
what's powering the split display
which is the battery itself
the standby time is up to 15 days
and you can have video playback up to five hours because this is a 6000 milliamp battery
it can run your favorite games a little bit of web browsing a little bit of multitasking
and you know what
why not
but not least it does have a camera
you have a five megapixel front-facing camera you know
we are in an era of a zoom due to the virus so of course this is very important to consider
um i don't know about selfies
those aren't as big right now
but zoom calls and all that absolutely massive
thank you guys for watching
this is going to be me logging off
hello and thanks for joining another review today we have the Polaroid p10 10.1
inch internet tablet
this is a $99 tablet from
Big Lots I'll give you a basic rundown of the specifications
it's a 10.1
inch internet tablet
it's a thousand twenty four by six hundred capacitive
multi-touch display a quad-core processor it runs Android 4.4.2 kitkat
it can produce
HD video output by way of the mini HDMI port adapter not included
it has bluetooth 4.0
a second as a rechargeable
lithium-ion polymer battery of around 8 hours battery life
it has a micro
USB port a headphone port it has a reset hole a power button and on the bottom
you have a micro SD card slot
now let's look at the screen
this has an edge lit screen unfortunately with edgelet screens
it's only viewable from front distance of about a foot and a half any further than that
it's a lot lighter in this tablet
you can go into the settings and they have a for the display
you can go down to smart colors
make sure the smart color is on in this mode
it does greatly improve the screen on this thing
it gives it a little bit more contrast and a little bit and it's a little bit sharper
let's go down to the about tablet you'll notice here it's Android version 4.4.2 and it is KitKat
they don't have any way of updating
unless you go through their site
it's just the basic tablet
it's pretty much filled with everything
I didn't have it set up
you notice the keyboard is very responsive seems to keep up with your keystrokes okay
we're connected to that now
let's go back to the Google Maps and I'll show you a little bit of the way they work
okay that's new
I have a little bit of lag
there let's go back into it
I really like it there
we go not quite used to this
maybe well they all have a little bit of a quirk to them okay
YouTube works very well
I've also installed Netflix
which works really good
the speakers on the back so it sounds tinny
this tablet has bluetooth and it's Bluetooth 4.0
I mentioned it earlier but I don't think I stressed enough
I will stand outside
it was more or less a mirror
it was unusable
it's not as comfortable to hold as a an iPad or anything like that
it's it's much heavier and it does have a good
you know rubber rubberized filling on the back
but it's still you know it's still very heavy
the screen really takes away from that
that's my review of the polaroid p10 10.1 internet tablet
please subscribe rate and check back
often thank you
hey guys this
ETA prime back here again today
we're gonna be taking a look at the all-new
Venky oh matrix pad s30
this is a new tablet to hit the market
it's got a 10.1 inch screen and octa-core CPU and it runs Android 9.0
the price point on this is 150
but this is the newest one that's popped up and supposedly the most powerful so in this video
I'm gonna do an unboxing go over the specs and then we'll put it through
its paces to see if it's worth picking up now the first thing
they're trying to hide something or two
it's just not a well known
CPU manufacturer but we're gonna find out everything about this tablet in just a second
the packaging is pretty plain
it's pretty heavy now
I know it's a 10.1
inch tablet but it seems like it should be a little lighter than it is
it is constructed of aluminum and it has a six thousand milliamp hour battery so
the tablet does have dual stereo speakers over on the left hand side
we have a 3.5 millimeter audio jack
we have our volume rocker
it actually looks really good
viewing angles are pretty decent but they could be better because this is a non laminated display
if you look close enough there is a gap between the touch panel and the display itself
IPS display but I get
ABG and an AC Wi-Fi so we can pick up that 5 gigahertz network bluetooth 5.0 and it does have 8
with this
now it will depend on what you're doing
it's got a 13 megapixel rear camera
8 megapixel front and it's running
Android 9.0 with the 2019 October patch
so it's fairly no
it's not the newest we could get
it is a stock
Android 9.0 version
there was only a sound recorder and an FM radio pre-installed
they claim that this screen is running at 60 Hertz but I beg to differ
here's another quick test running separately from the first one you saw this is retroarch
we're only at 50
it's only gonna run at a maximum of 50 and the flickering is very noticeable with this app
so if we just start up the app
I'm going to load up a game have the FPS counter
in the top
right hand corner you can see
it's locked at a maximum of 50 and that's really unfortunate even viewing videos
everything works great here
Hulu and these and Plex
we do have those dual stereo speakers
they sound pretty good and it gets pretty loud next up
we have the Geekbench for score for the s 30 single core 797 multi 32 35 over on the right
I just posted the scores
it did beat it out in every one of these individual scores also in the final test
I wanted to run was some native Android gaming so we have King of Fighters all-stars
we have minecraft now
I'm using the beta edition so I could see the FPS listed on screen and we're around 36 fps
remember this is a 50
Hertz display so
you won't get over that and even now when you get going or you get mining really hard
you're gonna notice it
I'm here and I know people are gonna ask about it
Call of Duty mobile
if you're just looking to play call of duty mobile
I couldn't recommend this tablet specifically for a game like this so in the end
it's really hard for me to recommend this tablet at the hundred and fifty dollar price tag
now it's a dying breed most definitely but I'm still a big fan of Android tablets in 2020
but that's pretty much it for this video guys
I really appreciate you watching
it's a definite pass on this tablet for me at least at this time
if you have any questions let me know in the comments below but like always
thanks for watching you
hey everybody its lines
I'd but now we're taking a look today at the Chewie high nine
this is an eight point four inch Android tablet and it costs about 200 bucks on gearbest.com
this video is being sponsored by pulse
comm they are a great service
that can fix your mobile device anywhere you are
you can go on their website to book an appointment
they will come out and meet you when they say they will come
there's no windows or anything here
you get a set appointment
in many instances they can come out the same day
we had a really fun time with pulse here in the studio
give them a call to even come to a coffee shop to get you going again
and if you use my coupon code
sometimes one device to the next might be a little different in this case
this one really feels cheap to me
the backing here is a very lightweight
plastic not very high quality
it felt like a build quality issue with it so immediately its curb appeal was not pleasing to me
and that's one of those things you run into with these devices
you're kind of buying at your own risk
you can see just how greasy it is here and we really haven't been using it all that much
this morning we had wiped down the screen and got it all cleaned up
and it's already picking up dirt and grease again
Lenovo so buy at your own risk here
our out of the box experience was not great but that's said from a hardware perspective
it isn't bad for the price point
it's got an 8.4
this one is very cold and that it's very blue
and you'll notice that when you're reading text and other things on there
it does have an mtk
so it's relatively up to date on that front
three hundred and forty eight point six grams or twelve point three ounces
so not all that heavy here
you can see what it looks like from the side
you have a headphone jack
here a micro
the speaker is in the back here
not so ok with the build quality
headphone jack here
but but so far
we did see a little better performance out of that
I'm gonna switch out of this now and go over to goat simulator
which is another 3d game here on the platform and you can see here
it's running pretty nicely on this one as well so
and there we got a score of 976 we puts it pretty much in line with some of the other tablets
we've looked at recently in this classification these 8-inch tablets so that
Lenovo tab for eight
there is a camera system on here not a great one
there's a 5 megapixel camera here on the back
the pictures are ok
nothing great but if you need a photo in a pinch you can probably grab one
it also does video 1080p at 30 frames per second no stabilization
the front is a little 2 megapixel selfie cam here again
not great but good enough for doing a Google hangout or a Skype call or something like that
so overall if it's not already apparent my enthusiasm for this tablet is not that great
I think you can do better for the money
I usually see better stuff out of Chewie than what we're seeing today
so by and large
I think you can skip this one if you are in the market for a $200 tablet
I do like the fact that it does have an ample amount of RAM and storage
which is good to see but that doesn't make up for its low quality build this is
hi I'd like to show off and give some of my impressions of the dragon touch
why 88x tablet for kids
so here's the tablet itself
they also while they sell this in multiple color
so here's the silicon case which
I'll put it in
the second is actually a very nice case
that doesn't come with a case so first impressions
I thought the tablet was I
I think it feels pretty good in the hand
it's got a nice form factor
USB port also a separate power
you can't charge it through their on/off button headphone jack
up and down
volume and also a micro
SD card slot
here speaker on the back speaker works ok so I guess I'm going to get into my impressions now
the screen on the front
I'm gonna go into a darker room because you're not gonna be able to see it here
well sorry for the end
it had a little technical difficulty getting it into the case but here it is
I think they did a nice job
overall it's got a good feel to it
the corners are a little flexible though
I mean it looks cute for kids
that's the microphone right there
then these have you can get to the volume buttons here
and you have the micro
put the card in and out and then covered it up and maybe hidden it away from him but anyway
I think they did a nice job
I think is a cute case again
it's still a pretty reflective screen
once you get it turned on
pretty much straight on
it's not all that well if you go right to left
it's not that bad
it turns off fairly quickly
if you're not using it which reminds me the battery life on
this is really not very good to be honest
it's taken me to make this video
it's gone down about 10 percent of the battery so the earlier video in this one
so let me pull it up
it's one of the things that comes built-in it comes with a lot of typical
it is difficult to see your tiles with the like the names of your kids
I don't have anything so I just said none so I'll pull it up so see if you can see this okay
there don't appear to be really any games at all now
it says it seems for
you're missing some so
it has some flash games
apparently that if you install flash they'll have but everything else
I mean it has a wide range of videos that your kids can watch if you wanted to
it has a art program
it's a very simplistic art program
so you're probably gonna want to download one of your own
they can
but that's pretty much the gist of what this does
so there's not a whole lot to that it has books and it's kind of a cool idea but you have to
which is a good idea because who knows who they're going to send video mail to and then like
I mentioned they have favorites
enter your birthday year
this is the pin so you can enter any number you want but apparently has to be a realistic
Berthier and yes I I was not born in 2000
I tried rebooting doesn't work
it goes right back into kid mode so your kids can't really you kind of get around it
I've tried various things I try to go to the home screen and try to fall
your own games as a regular tablet
it's it's not bad like
I already showed the screen to you
that's kind of the biggest fault looking at it right here
it looks pretty good so there are views
that don't look bad
it's just it's off access
viewing is pretty poor
but it's you can again download any apps that you want and the speed is okay
it's a little bit slower than other tablets or phones that I've used I date
it does have a quad core in it but that doesn't mean it's a fast quad core
do you want something that you're not gonna feel too bad if your kids you know
crack the screen also not too bad so to finish up
I'd point out before I think the case is really nice
I think it's comfortable
I think it's a good one for kids
it's a lot thicker so it's gonna be easier for small hands day
you know kind of get around it if they're not all that coordinated yes what
I want to conclude is that you're paying $60 for a tablet
I do think you get what you pay for but I want to manage your expectations
but it's going to cost you a lot less
because it's not a name-brand that's not going to be the case
you probably gonna want to load your own and yeah
I have thank you very much for watching
what is going on guys
we'll be doing just that so personally
I would use this tablet for 3d sculpting photo and video editing and for this review
a three-in-one cable which of course allows you to hook up your tablets to your computer
a cleaning cloth
this one is made of soft lycra and nylon ten spare pen nibs with a nib clip
they come packaged in this
so let's talk about some specs
this tablet uses a full HD 15.6 inch screen with a 16 to 9 aspect ratio
the battery free pen has 8192 sensitivity levels and has plus minus 60 degrees tilt recognition
the tablet will not function on
if not you can always get an adapter
it also needs to be hooked up to the power supply
the tablet has six
which makes it really convenient to carry if you travel a lot
you know it certainly feels like it's gonna last
the back
plate is made of brushed aluminium
I was also really impressed with the stand
you have to install the drivers so simply hop on to who
the tablet seemed to be perfectly calibrated when I first started using it
I like to set one of the express keys on the pen as the middle mouse
click and the other one as the ctrl
+ S key by setting one of the keys on the tablet as the control key and another as the shift key
it makes it so much easier to get those precise lines exactly where you need them to be
it's just generally more pleasant to work with
it really makes it feel like you're drawing with a pen so for some reason
I was really excited about the glove and I just couldn't wait to try it on
you would find on your phone
these will not respond to touch
they will only respond to the pen
you know when you draw with a pencil on paper the angle at which you hold
your pencil has a huge impact on the line width the texture and what not so
let's take a look at these pen nibs
so the reason why you'd want more than one is that they tend to wear out and flatten with time
this is Lisa from mobile tech review
today we're going to look at the latest
we're going to look at it now so here
it is the latest
that's a higher resolution than your 1080p nice flat-screen TV that you might own at home
of course that is the same resolution as the Nexus 7 so
you want a sharp picture too
don't you this is the 7 inch model
hopefully give me a bit more money but otherwise looking at the same feature same
Note 10.1 and the Nexus 10 tablets as well but back to this guy right here
a lot of improvements under the hood
the operating system now gets a name there she call it fire
OS and they
they have improved it you know
there's a record
you get all of your application icons over here so it's a bit more intuitive
UI it's also a lot faster
well now
they've done a lot of changes to both
go back home over here and then go to books next sees all real quick and right now it's defaulting
you're showing me stuff on the cloud as ever
Amazon has plenty of cloud services
none that doesn't just mean like you
Dropbox style putting your files up there that you can do that kind of thing too
Drive like I have music up there and this is not stuff I've even purchased them
I've just put that up there so all this stuff is actually on the cloud
Amazon has done a wonderful job here
we have Dolby Digital Plus audio and stereo speakers that are on the back now
they're up here pretty easy to see through the glossiness on the top
bevel over here and there is a bevel so notice even if you put it on the table
it's not going to be flat against the table
the speaker's so your audio won't be muted which is very good so definitely some of the best audio
I don't have to do that
is loud enough clear enough info enough and I can hear it
we take a look at the back some more here
soft touch finish not immune to fingerprints does get greasy
you can clean it up at the damp cloth just fine so we have
Amazon's usual a unique unique sense of style
here it's kind of interesting
this is our power button right here on the opposite side
we have our volume controls right there
so when you're holding it there's a little
Ridge you can feel it now
I have to say these
get the award for being some of the most tactile buttons ever
they really dip down
you can really feel them however
if the speakers are up top here your up volume is going to be towards the top on the side here
we have a microUSB port for charging and for copying stuff from your PC to the device
just use a standard
Android file transfer
this is running
it's a little weird because this has an up
Evan you plug in the cable
it's going to stick at an angle
don't worry your ports in that vent that's just the way it's designed on the other side
we have our three point five millimeter combo audio jack
headphone and microphone
you swipe down you can turn your auto rotation on and off quick access to
Brighton is very bright
you can see if I move it around
it's a glossy display
it's a lot easier in the eyes and there's no glare this
do we have quick control of our music playback over here and here's Mayday
they can't see you don't worry and they can hear you
you can hear them
Amazon account you can actually enter your Google account and here
sound keyboards you can choose from different languages here
we'll take a look at that
in fact here
we have our language selection you can also choose keyboards and Bluetooth keyboard languages
we have our text to speak speech feature over here as well and the rest of it not as exciting
we do have parental controls here
reading books are using certain applications
you can go ahead and do them for those of you
Amazon goes for kind of wider
feel a bit more like a book kind of aspect ratio
so there's a difference both going to have the same resolution display other than that
there is a whole lot
that's different to this runs obviously full
Android over here very vanilla
that battery is sealed inside here
no removable door to access that battery
Amazon claims 11 hours of mixed use time and 17 hours
if you're just reading and pretty much that has been on target
we've been managing about 10 and a half hours of mixed use including watching
Amazon Prime videos reading magazines reading books
that sort of thing
so what's inside
it's pretty cool this time usually
Amazon goes with something like I you know
no 330 graphics
means you can play some nice games on this
we hope that we see some more killer 3d games on here
that's pretty much standard for a higher-end tablet or smartphone these days so that's plenty of
RAM to run any programs that you want it's available 16 32 or now 64 gigs of storage as well
the 16 gig
Wi-Fi only is going to cost
you 229 the 32 gig is 269 if you want to go up to 64 gigs 309 dollars
there is no expansion slot on this device
that's the with offers price
it's up to you turn it off and turn it on and there's your offer so
I was pushing a movie right now
so you get good
Wi-Fi reception on these
we have bluetooth on board as well works for things like Bluetooth keyboards as ever
so for those of you who have a big investment in Google
Play applications that you've paid for it
I mean the free ones because they'll probably available to here like we have
Evernote you can get
it's actually pretty easy to sneak some of the Google applications on here you can see
the fellow has done a lot of work towards getting some of the google applications on here
but you can see that
i've got chrome which doesn't come on here just so you guys don't get confused
Google Play muse
we'll play books
Google Play magazines
I've side loaded all of those
and how do you do that
it's not not too hard at all
just turn that on so you can sign load programs
I use andro file explorer use a USB cable
and then look for the folder where you put it like downloads would be a wise place to do it
Gmail did not come on here either
I did add that a little Google Play services gmail works fine by the way
that's not a problem
whatever get what's over
now there's a magazine that I've downloaded so you can see
it does actually work so fun to have alternatives
you can go ahead and read
we'll start that one
downloading magazines are actually a lot bigger than ebooks
so that's going to take a little
meanwhile we'll take a look at books and Stephen King's latest book
I also have a Kindle paperwhite
I've been reading that book on the paperwhite and it knows that
sharp text the super-high resolution IPS
nice speeds beautiful looking screen
it makes more sense if you have a big ten inch or larger screen to do that kind of thing
obviously there's an accelerometer so it's going to rotate with you
Snapdragon 800 CPUs and any of the fastest CPUs available for mobile devices today
3.3 D mark
ice storm the extreme test not the basic test sixteen thousand six hundred and fifty seven
that's very good
we have the silk browser as amazon calls it which is just a fine
it's fast it plays html5 video and we'll look at a video in fact review our Note 10.1 2014 edition
there lit up right now because
I've just touched them
so there you go embedded video plays fine and just for fun again
you'll get the same experience that you do on
Angry Birds real easy
that is beautiful looking
take a little nitro drive a little dirty
yeah they know about a shortcut
I don't anyway
it's playing absolutely beautifully visual effects on the screen
the whole nine yards looking great
some reading magazines doing some web browsing probably
seven inch is going to work for you if you watch a lot of movies
you're going to enjoy the 8.9 inch more probably
I know I do
it's just a lot more immersive when you get a bigger screen
and who is this device for
well you know there are plenty of seven and eight inch tablets on the market right now
you ready to go the next episode
well that's going to work too because there is Amazon Prime for iOS but for those who have Android
you know that they've never made an application for that
obviously this wouldn't be the product for you again
I'm Lisa from mobile tech review
why hello there
good people of the earth
Shaun's Nelson here from fantastic anatomy and in today's video
I've tried the bamboo
I borrowed it from a friend so I'll be comparing it to those so starting off with the pen
this pen is exactly the same
I like the way that this part thickens and the rubber grip the weighting of it
I think and I'm not really that like I don't baby it and I don't like try to push
I'm not trying to draw lightly or anything like that
I don't know I assume that's from more poor construction
I can't imagine he's pressing down so much harder than me that it wore it down
there used to be two buttons here
this is the one thing that has quote-unquote broken air
these things is a little plastic piece that broke off
I never really used it that much
this thing is made of some like futuristic super material
I always transport this
I just wrap the cable around it and stick it in my bag
you know like put this here
wrap the cable around a couple times and then stick it in my bag and that's how
because you know it's all computer and everything like that but this thing is super sturdy man
it's it's crazy
I'm going to bang it around and push my luck but um but really this is
this is a really solid piece of equipment
and here
it's got these
these are the buttons like that you can program to whatever
I don't really use them too much
I don't know like it seemed exactly the same as the companion
I don't know I guess if you hold it like that you can
it's not the it might not be as good as the companion to
I'll mention is that the cable is really nice and long
look how long this cable is
and it's tough too
it's good casing it never
it'll work you don't need to like plug it in before you start up your computer or anything too
it's fine you could have it on your lap
the computer in front of you aways it's fine
I've never had a problem with that
looks like a very sturdy construction
sorry about the dirtiness but it just goes to show that you know
I'm showing you this is how I use it
I didn't clean it up or anything
this is just how it is
it's a real-life honest-to-god review of the Wacom Intuos 3 and I think that's it
I think that covers all the bases so basically actually let me
let me compare it to the bamboo more the memos significantly cheaper but I would not recommend it
my friends bamboo first off
the construction felt super flimsy
you know what
I mean
my friends come
bamboo has these big buttons
one of them had like a big crack down it or something and you could tell the whole
the whole
a whole tablet was like warped a little bit or cracked or bent
um which would
I can't imagine that could never really happen with this
I don't know I went
you'd have to put it through to crack or bend it
it's kind of ridiculously strong
um and the pen
I don't know if I already mentioned this
but the pen of the bamboo did not feel
is this in 203 and this size
I kind of liked the idea of having it at a at a 45 degree angle
but um but it's really convenient and easy just kind of going like this
you know like the color area in or if you want to get a long line just kind of go like that
um this works fine
if you like it you might like it bigger
you might like it smaller
some people like it smaller
it makes it more convenient to make like a long line
you just go like that as opposed to having to really move across the whole screen so
I hope that was helpful
you have any questions
let me know in the comments down below and peace
god bless and stay fantastic everyone
what's up everybody
a lot of people might not be able to afford that especially right now so today
we're gonna be taking a look at a more budget-friendly tablet that has a lot of great specs
this is the van
Keogh matrix pad s30
it has a ten inch 1080p
IPS display it comes with Android 9pi with no bloatware it's got three
gigs of RAM 32 gigabytes of storage expandable up to 128 gigabytes
it has a 1.6 gigahertz octa-core CPU
it's got a 13 megapixel rear camera and an 8 megapixel front camera it has bluetooth
5.0 it has a 5 gigahertz
Wi-Fi antenna GPS and it has a 6000 mAh battery that should supply about 15 hours of use so
please use those links because it helps me keep purchasing products
did you review you guys
storage here is the tablet
we'll go ahead and just put that aside for just a second here
that's pretty much it
so here is the tablet itself
I can tell you it has some really good weight
it doesn't feel like it's cheap
so here is the tablet itself
it's got a nice metal backing on it like
I said before it has a really good weight to it
there are our dual stereo speakers
one over here one over here
so let's go and talk about the build quality real quick like
I said before it does have some weight to it
it's not super light but it's not super heavy as well
it feels nice and solid doesn't feel cheap or like it's going to bend or break on you
the whole backing of this as well as the sides is made of aluminum
it's got a nice cool
sometimes it can be really bad and really uneven here with the matrix pad as you can see
I'm in total darkness
I am starting up the tablet and there's really minimal light bleed
it's really not bad at all
it's pretty responsive
this is the first screen that you see so the first thing
I want to touch on for the UI is the smoothness
it's pretty smooth
I really don't have any complaints as far as the UI
the sound quality is pretty good too
it'll definitely give you a loud enough sound to listen to anything you need to you
know right in front of you and a fairly quiet environment
we're go ahead and let you listen to the sound here
play one of my videos so we are at full volume right now like
I said it definitely is loud enough for your personal listening
you know right in front of you
the battery life on this tablet is also pretty good for my testing
that's pretty much the scenario that a lot of people are going to be using
that's going to be using a tablet that's going to be streaming and wanting to you know
see the tablet in brighter environments
half way is going to be about that and for eight hours of battery life
you're going to have to manually go into the settings and lower and higher
It Yourself depending on your situation
the tablet also isn't super thick
I think it's a pretty good size for what it is
I don't really care how slim the tablet is as you can see as paired up by the galaxy s6
it's really not that much thicker
it is a little bit thicker than the galaxy but again to me
that's really really not a determining factor or whether or not
I want to buy the tablet
it's not super thick and it's not super thin
I think it's perfectly fine for what you need to use it for
I've already added some apps and everything but as you can see
this is a 1080p screen but the quality of the screen is really quite good
if you look at my little logo down here you can perfect
we make out what that says
the pixels are super small
it's not blurry
so if you did need to use this tablet for reading you can definitely do that
we are on a web page
that doesn't look jagged
definitely going to be easy to do some reading now as far as the screen brightness goes right now
I haven't had any problems
viewing what's on the screen
it doesn't get super bright and bright enough to where you can you know
see everything easily in direct sunlight but for the majority of the time
it does definitely download quicker than the 2 point 4 gigs
and it's definitely quick enough for pretty much
this tablet works really
this tablet is works
it does pretty much everything you need to do except play higher res games and like
I said before you're not going to buy a hundred and fifty dollar laptop it and expect it to run
your you know really high-end game so as you can see we're playing temple run here
there's no lag whatsoever
everything's running pretty smoothly as you can see
there is no lag
G I just kind of want to show you what it was looking like
this is on the lowest setting so it's still definitely playable
there is just a little bit of lag
it's not super bad so you can still definitely play it
and then here's a little sample of what the video quality is like on the tablet
the video is definitely pretty sharp
it's got some good colors
I think are even better than the video capture another thing
I was really surprised at is during charging and usage of this tablet
it never once got warm
it was always cool to the touch
it's a nice tablet
the battery lasts quite some time
it's got a good picture
I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did give me a thumbs up
don't forget to subscribe and hit that little notification bell to let you guys know when
I put out into videos
thank you guys for watching
I hope you have a great day and I'll see him the next one later
hey everybody its Brock
Bowman from Bowman GT channel
I've got something new for the f-150 as I did in the last video
I did quick unboxing of this unit that I plan to install in the build f-150 and it's a 12.1
Android tablet center stack
they back up a little bit unfortunately
nobody wants to see that anyhow
this particular one is made by Phoenix
I think Phoenix automotive and so far
I'm about 80% impressed
you do have to follow the directions which you're only in video form on their website
they do not have anything in the box at least not the box
I got so you're pretty much on your own
you have to go to their site
watch what those guys do
if you don't intuitively know how to do it you end up reusing parts like this
HVAC unit here and your switches
of course up here okay and it works out fine
everything works just like it's supposed to that way
you know an interesting thing is it
uses a lot of the old parts
I don't know what's gone with this thing
so the funny thing is the tablet has some redundant features over what you know
this thing does on its own your stock stuff like it has its own equalizer
I don't know what that is
let's go through the features here
Play Store which is pretty cool for this particular unit
I'm not one thing I haven't figured out yet is
the sound isn't working
okay that's one gripe responsive pretty good
it has lots of abilities as far as cameras
go you can add in your cameras
if you want to add in the beer cameras and a front camera you can do aftermarket it
can you stock it routines like I said a lot of the same features that it had before now this one
I have the automatic HVAC
okay if you have the other style the manual you actually have to order a different kit
there's two different kids one for automatic one for without but
one of the things
I don't like is the fact that when you click music it comes up to
does this where you can change two different types of media now
video is the same story as the music pretty much
it looks for local files and it'll play them
here's the choices you get you do rear cam but if you guys know anything about
Ford can bus
it doesn't activate that unless it's in
Reverse right if it's in Reverse it does its on its own and it's actually pretty good about it
the screen actually looks better than the stock screen
those can bus information is static
I can't figure out how to change it yet
although it is pretty interesting how you can see me super our
fault ones which is not many of et cetera etc
but again not all out there like another double feature
you have if you have factory now
you don't need to hook any of the stuff that comes up with this
that didn't make any sense
I can't remember how to get to her at this second
I think I have to go see
like a tablet
you can do this
scroll through the things i koruba now
this doesn't work but I don't know if I won
wait for it by the way
there's a lot of over screens that happen in this
for instance let's see if this will work doesn't always work
sometimes it'll tell you the doors open
sometimes it won't
I haven't figured that one out yet
don't consult any gun to console
take you back to your home screen and then you can get back to your you know so
that's from the internet from the tablet
doesn't seem to come through
so what do you do you know
I mean I think I can even enact Street View on this is which is pretty
cool but most tutoring satellite was it
anyway guys you're getting the idea
I mean this thing isn't perfect but it is pretty cool
I mean it looks neat especially if you've got you know the big center stack
I don't know I really divided on it
what do you guys think you know
tell me your comments below
what do you think this thing is worth
I mean would you use it
would you like one for your truck
I got to hear from you guys cuz really
I'm on the fence with this thing do I keep this or do I send it back
it looks neat but functionality-wise
I mean it's just
I'm driving
but the wow factor let me know what you think guys sorry
this was in a very dynamic video but I really don't know how to explain this thing very well
it is what it is you know just is what it is alright guys signing out for now
thanks for watching
hey guys are you doing top here here
today we're going to be reviewing a star of five by XV pen today is going to be very different
like you're also tablet not also tablet but tablets
were also your impression of it
I'm not going to name which is which but some tablets I didn't think what's going to be
that stellar turned out to be amazing in the long run and vice versa
or some tablet
I thought was going to be very promising
gameplay that is so without further ado let's get to the tablet so
is this big huge dent
here you might be wondering like whoa
what the [ __ ] happened so this is what happened
that's how the product that came
you know the box that came in and had a huge gaping crater here like
but they could have maybe
um so that's that uh the tablet product itself
ok um has a bunch of like inputs on the other side here
the significance signature like tablet area
whatever that is we call it the indication
Xbox and logo nothing really like sasquatch
it's like the tablet itself
four rubber feet
you have no idea how much I love these
I'm going to get to that later
I'm not sure if you can see it here
it's like the color screen to and then that's when you can use your pen
this is a pen
I'm going to show you later
you can like use it very very simple and the this is the signal receiver the USB
I think it's 2.0
not really sure because the color is the hill now that I see it
the co is kind of blue but
it feels like
I'm actually holding on to a pen
not some kind of like weird ass dick that
I that I have to just move around for the tablet pen usage
I can't stress enough
it feels as if
that's what that was like the difference
it's a g5 40 84 30 pen that comes with it
it became really slippery
warranty whatever extension if you like to like share on facebook thanksgiving card
that has like a bunch of thank-you messages to you
the graphic ten tablet manual
which really just you know
we probably won't need if you know what
I read what you're doing quick guide
you won't need if you know what you're doing a SD pen pen driver
this didn't work unfortunately
I tried many different settings on Windows
10 didn't work so I could literally just rate the city and happen
it won't make much difference
probably how did you get to start with the work
I went online
I went to their website
download up the driver
it works completely
this is so there's that and there's also this there's like a sticker bottom like tab
I don't exactly know what I'm supposed to call it
it has the sticker sight
so you peel it all because of sticker
just attach onto it
okay so that's basically all
oh one more thing he also gave you
this gave me this artist antifouling glove that they could use for drawing but
I'm not going to be drawing as for Oso gameplay it looks like this
it's probably ambidextrous although the logo is on BIA
on the top at the pump the other side
I don't exactly know
that's called via dorsal side for economical terms
thanks anatomy captain or med school
so wears like this and the reason
I was looking forward to this
was because like sometimes
how was it it wasn't like as great as I had expected to be
the reason being is that
I'm I'm playing
you have your hand kind of like you
I just couldn't like control my aim
that will so that was my like a grain of salt well using that
I'm pretty sure I was really fine when trying but like for really really high
precise like momentum heavy stuff like also gameplay
I didn't think it was anything to be praised that you you so yeah
that was the overall breakdown of the tablet and before
I go I just wanted to give you a very very last minute
like review of this entire product as to what
I don't understand what they did here is
I know I do understand what I did here
they put for a fee
but then like it's so grippy it's amazing it doesn't move around at all of my tat on my surface
my desk is kind of very slippery
and it withstands that very very nicely amazing job you have no idea of born business to me
I've complained multiple times to many different companies
as to like the tablet being too slippery this like no issue whatsoever amazing job 10 is nice
it feels like the pen not like a stick
the holder is a touch in the receivers
there it's very low profile which you know
it's kind of like standard for most wireless products and this loop here although
I don't think I'd be reusing this
the charging cables are in all here
extension cables a nice addition glove
unfortunately didn't really paid out too
well make a better CD and the rest of the stuff is just like whatever
yeah so if you do have any questions leave your comments down below
I'll be more than glad to answer any of the questions that you may have a little
please don't forget to like the video if you liked it
please do subscribe if you really like the video
I hope you liked it
I'll see you guys next time
take care bye bye
my name is
I've just wanted to show you what comes in the box so here it is
it's pretty compact in the box
so it comes quite unique box
kids were quite excited when it arrived and it comes in its case
so this is the tablet as you can see it comes in
you just pop your speed part into there so
it's gotta be the case that it comes in and it's totally robust as you can see
it's been used
it's about a few smudgy marks on it and there's because it acts like a bumper
it's not gonna get too damaged if it's dropped or which obviously happens
my daughter dropped it quite a few times
but she's a bit younger than my son and then the other really cool thing that it comes with here
is this stand
that's a slight disadvantage
because they won't they'll have to have it if they want to understand
it'll need to be like this but it's you know
there are a couple of areas where
I think there could be room for improvement or things that some people might find
are that the battery
life could be better
I'm a couple of other things
the storage space
um the only other thing really would be that
the camera on the device is not amazing but again
it's not really a huge drawback
I don't think it will be that much of a problem
I really hope you found this short video helpful
and if you'd like to read my full review of the new generation

it's an Android tablet now this Andrew
this is a great color one
he also comes over as a premium designed dragon touch case as well as you can see here alright
so this is a like a different case
that's made exclusively by
so if you're watching your film is perfect
he also comes over two different kind of charges discharge up as you can see at the top
it has this charger here
and then he also micro
yeah mostly the first thing
I would say is you know is bad dragon touch
I know that and it's made for kids
part is a very slow tablet
okay for the price of 50 70 per-- nothing
I love faster for affordable prices
this is a little very slow
very takes ages to start up to navigate through some things it takes ages as well
okay so this is
that's the negative side of it but let me go through the positive things
yes it's Bowen Android M 7.1
and muga with a 7 inch
M display with IPS
that you know helps to protect them kids
I set so that's one good finger Barry so mostly when it comes to sensitivity was ease decent
okay but it's very slow to operate this
you can all operate via adult mode or kids mode so you can go to the main menu
okay so let me go to main menu
so that's the good thing about this but a lot of tablets
have that kind of feature if you download the app from the App Store
it also has dual cameras
SD memory card and pour on the right side as well okay so also
it also has a premium apparel to control
Wi-Fi so we can actually connect to the internet
and you know that's none of a good thing about this other than that build quality was
I wouldn't say is excellent okay
but you know if it's for kids and then you know he's decent but for the price range
I wouldn't really recommend this tablet
there's not much to say about this
okay is slow you know
it's a slow tablet charge
doesn't last that long
don't even that stands out of the whole
you know tablet everything is the casing okay
that's the exclusive case that's made by dragging and dragon touch bother than that
it's a very useless tablet
okay and you can find a better one for that price
bear branded ones okay
so we fish

welcome to the necklace 11 x12 technology today
I'm looking at the yuan ten
sixty plus graphic strong tablet
the current price is around 90
there's a lot included in the box
we also get a cleaning cloth and last but not least the user's manual along with the driver
that are about twenty five point four by fifteen point two four centimeters according to UI
this graphics tablet supports both
it's not even heavy
USB connection to connect the tablet with the pc the included cable is 150 centimeters
just install the driver plug the tablet in
and you're ready to go
I'm amazed on how easy and fast it actually went
Anna main side here left our twelve
Express keys that can be reprogrammed in the software to assign functions such as control Z
so basically undo and stuff like that right here these sixteen software or function keys
the drawing surface is very very smooth
but it isn't really a fingerprint magnet
which is nice
the digital pen is lightweight
batteries are not required for the pen
it comes with a built-in rechargeable battery that you can recharge with the included cable
while it's charging the pen can be used and doesn't power up
I like that
let's get to the unveiling of my piece of art a masterpiece
I have some crazy drawing skills
I know I might as well sell that picture for $5,000 if you're interested let me know
that's a good price in investment for the future
even including an 8 gigabyte micro SD card with that said I can definitely recommend this you
a young 1060 + graphics drawing tablet
it also deserves my silver award as it really delivers for its price

I'm here doing a review for a new tablet that he just ordered
it's a drawing tablet for
XP pin pretty interesting uh uh
sylvan has the same version that I just bought and right
now we're gonna show it off
now give me one moment while
I open this thing up and take the box out of the box
and yes
r05 wireless tablet indeed wireless the what
I love about it
the pen does not need charging
I have a Nancy
I think it's a human tablet that's a hand-me-down from selvan after uh they got their Experian
it's very fidgety
I have to Inglot just right in order to use it in
you have to torch the pin
I'm not this and it's really cool
so yeah completely wireless
no it does not all right
let me get this open and I'll show off what it could do
oh my god try the camera quality is it anyway uh
I can't get this open
I know I can okay here
we go so this cost around very sleek design very thin
I need to see all that
it's not that big as you can see but trust me when
I say it's just exactly the right size meter for the job
let's see what are these
I think these are seven later
I guess I could put the pin in here
don't keep it
the tablet needs to be charged but it definitely not a pin and C charger
so you know you can just use any
Android type charger another one
yeah oh it comes with an extension cord
that's very thoughtful of them all right
yeah that's the wireless adapter the driver
CD has the code the stuff in it so I'm not gonna show that up
but there's the pin your wireless you know
I think there might be some
yeah there's a button on
I'll shut that off a bit later right now
I'm gonna get something right now not quite ready to uh well
it's working on the computer
it comes with yeah comes at
the drying glove helps uh
I don't know so what does this help with
I think it helps
protect the tablet
all right drivers done installing did not need a product key so that was pretty cool um
I'm about to open up paint or sign-in show off some of this stuff
it can do awful quick and no
it's not my setup
one the sticky time that came with the XP pan is actually for holding your pin
you get it sticks
press the star on the keyboard to open up any tool
you want really cool right
tell further ado
let's just start it
yo welcome back to the channel
today i have another tablet review from gamo this time
it's the pd 2200 model
they sent me a tablet a while ago which i gave away
congratulations to nico
i hope it's serving you well but let's just get right into the good stuff once
i opened the box
there was another box i should have known go ahead
it comes with a battery
free pen a 21.5
inch ips screen 8192 pressure levels and a 1080p resolution
speaking of resolutions mine
this year was to try race shadow
legends raid's a tough game
and that's just a start if you care about storytelling
no matter what you like raid's got something for you
raid's the hottest mobile game around and it's only getting bigger
i personally enjoy the graphics and find it to be visually appealing especially for a mobile game
the main event is already here the doom tower
it's a giant tower with 120 floors
a bunch of secret challenge rooms and 12 seriously badass bosses to take on
there's really never been a better time to start playing and to help get everyone started
in the tower the raid team are giving away a super special champion bulwark
he's absolutely awesome in clan boss
and he's also going to be a huge help in the tower against those bosses
if you want to get a huge head start in raid
as soon as you get in game you'll find your extra rewards here in your inbox for the next 30 days
only and it's that easy
just click the link in the description
and i'll see you in the game
is it interesting going
back to the tablet review my cat butters couldn't wait anymore so we quickly set it up
it has eight programmable touch keys on the left and five menu buttons on the right
so i'm assuming it's tailored more for right-handed people to me
it's not that big of a deal
the stand works really well and the angle could be adjusted
and that's always good to have
i really like this tablet and i'm actually thinking of keeping it
we were already working on a rosalina model and we used the tablet to finish the job
the process was the same
as the other models we made sculpt it out we topologize it rig it and into unreal it goes
we're going to be uploading little animations and renders like these on instagram

susan was watching youtube watch
oh my god okay 100.
smile thank you for all the people who supported me along the way i love
you all see you in the next video right you
hey what's going on guys
it's your boy serrano
welcome back to the channel
well you can do so all you have to do is long
hold the screen right here
show google app so now when you go to the left
so let's say you're getting a youtube notification
maybe you want to silence that
just swipe to the right right here
then you're going to see a little gear icon
just go ahead hit that and then you could hit silence right here so that one that way
it's going to silence the notification
then you just hit apply and it's going to go ahead and do that
another thing i did notice
that's how you would actually create your folders now
another thing you can do on
this device is add different users on it so just swipe down from the right hand side
swipe down one more time and you're gonna see this icon
that looks blue with a person's head in it
just go ahead hit that
if you want to activate the app draw go ahead and long hold the screen
click that as well
just go into display
then go into your option where it says home screen layout right here
you can select the app tray but if you don't want it to do that just click tilt mode
i don't have to swipe up but it does feel a little bit more
clean this way to be completely honest with you
so what i did was downloaded
this app called add guard and basically what it does is block
now another thing i like going here
is these the this gestures option
just hit the button right here where it says screenshot then what you want to do is hit
that's cool on here
is that this device does get the the security software support
it says checking for update
then it says this device will be updated and it will fix the bugs and increase this device
stability it's in about 204 megabytes for the download
another thing that's cool is multitasking
hold the youtube with your finger
you're going to get split screen
it's going to access the split screen window
let's go ahead and hit chrome so you you can
you could browse on your youtube right here at the top all right so something
that's cool is
let's say you have two windows open
and let's say you
type um lenovo tab m 10 plus full hd plus and then you just click that
what's cool is that
it'll come up here on the window and this is the model
i have the 149 model but i recommend the 199 model
just pay the extra for 50
that's cool is if you hit the power button twice double click it one two
let me see
it's going to be somewhere here where it will take you to the apps or you could just see here
it is apps down below
what you're going to do is locate wallpapers app
that's like the grand canyon but you could set up the frequency of it
right here
set wallpapers home screen
then once you do that you have enabled daily wallpapers
another thing that this device does have is dolby
atmos so if you slide down from the top and you could see right here
it has this option that says music
when that's unchecked it's going to say dolby but hit that and then hit this option
you can lock the device and things of that nature
you could just hit it right here
it's going to be password protected
another thing that we have is raised to wake and double tap to wake
you is adaptive brightness
where the phone or tablet i mean will adapt to the outdoor conditions
so if it's light outside it will get brighter
if it's indoors it will get lower in the light as well another thing
that's pretty cool
is the indicator light for notifications
um what you can do is wait for the screen to load on the web page
here it is so you may want to save some information for later
uh go ahead wait for it to load on the screen and um let me just wait for that to load
so let's see right here
you can actually um you know record the screen right here with this button
it's going to give you the option for screen recorder so you just go ahead hit that
it's saying right here but you get to you
get this toggle where you can move it around
and you can just record whatever's happening on the screen and things of that nature
this device also does have screen cast right here
there is another app that i use for things like instagram
and now even if i'm like in instagram or something like that the screen will automatically rotate
that's pretty cool is in settings when you go to this option right here called screen assistant
um screen assistant is pretty cool right here
blue light filter for your eyes or change
when you hit the arrow you can turn on screen right
slide it to this side and now you can pretty much
usually in the middle of the night is best fit
you could do it around you know like three
a.m in the morning and then hit okay and then um you know it'll turn off
you could always power it back up
is this option inside of the battery settings
location always turned on so that way
i usually put that for five minutes on my device right here so that it won't timeout
you won't be able to be disturbed by the apps that you choose
so let's say you wanted to put um instagram on that list
maybe twitter
maybe um you know just you wanted to just you know
get a social media
you wanted to hibernate from that a little bit so you would just turn on those ones
for the lenovo tab m plus full hd and i'll get right back with you later group peace you
what's happening everyone
my name is alex and welcome back in today's video
we are checking out one of the latest affordable tablets from vasquing called the kingpad s810
so this is a tablet that has a 10 inch screen and runs android 10.
we have an octa-core cpu
that's paired with 3 gigs of ram and 32 gigs of internal storage
friendly tablet for a super quick unboxing
the tablet comes in a decent looking box on the front of the box
you're obviously gonna find the tablet itself
we have a little user manual
we have the usbc charging cable and the power adapter
so that's about it for the box
the tablet itself looks and feels more expensive than what it is and that has a lot to do
well that's not the case with this one
you almost get that ipad
asian feel of this one so the top we have that slot for the sd card on one side
we have the power button and the volume keys at the bottom
we have two speakers so luckily we get two speakers of this tablet
unfortunately they're both at the bottom
we have a 3.5 mil audio jack
so if you want to plug in some headphones you can
and of course you have a usbc charging port on the front we have a 10 inch ips panel
that has a 1080p resolution
so if you watch any videos on youtube you can select 1080p as the resolution
the screen does look really good
it charging the tablet to the charger
that comes in the box is done in just under four hours
the tablet does great for social media apps
so if you watch youtube videos that will work great so no lag for that
the maximum resolution of course is 1080p for any videos
we also have a camera on the front and one on the back of the tablet
the maximum recording resolution for the front camera is 480p where the back is 720p
i mean you're recording in 480p
so that's what you get with a budget tablet like this
so should you buy a tablet like this
well i mean for the price
you're getting one of the best screens on any tablets
i mean i haven't seen any other cheap tablets that have a screen
all right guys um
hopefully you enjoyed this video if you did like it
don't forget to press that like button
don't forget to subscribe and i will see you guys in the next one
thanks for watching
zerrin and i just wanted to give you a quick overview of this 9-inch proscan tablet
I've got this one
that's new in the box and then
I've got another one
I bought the two of these last Christmas and thought they would make great gifts this
Christmas is coming one of these
I'm giving away in two contests and the other one
it ended up being used around our house so anyway
I thought I'd give you a quick overview of what the proscan 9-inch is okay
so hopefully you can read this
these are the basic specs of the unit
probably one of the main downsides to this unit 9 is display
TFT capacitive touch and sorry capacitive touchscreen
and so that's pretty much toast with connections three-and-a-half millimeter headphone jack
the case is quite a few people here in the house
so things happen
this is this will get pulled out
it's a little bit heavier than other tablets that we have
it doesn't have a lot of power
the one gig of ram and no bluetooth is an issue for me personally
there's game that
I'm playing there what can I tell you
I mean it's a it's an Android tablet
there's nothing wrong with them
you're just not going to be able to write a lot of apps at the same time and you know
expect expect what you're going to get for the price but I think what I would want to say
is that for the price
it's a really good value if it had two kids of
RAM I think it would be a fantastic value but for what it is
I think they're great so I'm gonna give the proscan
let's see rating a rating out of five again for the price
thanks for watching
- A few months ago, I reviewed my first color
eReader called the PocketBook Color.
Unfortunately for me, you folks are a vocal audience.
Littering the comments of that video were repeated suggestions to test out a book's branded
eReader from a company called Onyx International.
(upbeat music)
Can I just say this is one of the biggest reasons I love Android and over the years
All of it made possible by the fact that you can kind of put Android on anything.
So it should come as no surprise that it's perfectly content to run an E-paper screen as well.
Obligatory shout out to the old YotaPhone, rip.
That E-Paper screen has a name, Kaleido Plus.
It's the latest generation of E ink from the company of the same name.
Seeing it after sunset depends on an integrated front light
that gets the job done
Watching Lisa from Mobile Tech review cover the company's Note
Air made me envy
that model's thin metallic construction and stylish orange piping.
anchoring the display, there's nothing remarkable about it.
Now you can replace it with a launcher of your choice
like Nova or Niagara.
But honestly, after just a few hours with both I scurried right on back to the Onyx homescreen.
Remember Kaleido
Now that said this display does offer much faster refresh rates than any E Ink screen
I've used before.
At its slowest it's your typically E reader
the screen is a hot rod.
It's almost fast enough to watch a quick video.
It's bizarrely satisfying to be able to run the same apps and visit the same websites
I do on my phone
but on this high contrast, highly power efficient display.
So why not
just leave the display on the fastest setting all the time?
This is called ghosting
and it's a much bigger issue on a color panel like this.
Even when you're set to normal mode you get more ghosting than you do on a monochrome screen.
Onyx is working on the issue part of the reason for all the software updates.
But let's be real, right?
And here the Nova 3 Color delivers.
when used with the stylist that comes in the box.
And the software overall is responsive and very customizable.
You can navigate using Samsung style
Just keep in mind
So if you're listening to an audio book you have to keep the screen on while you're doing it.
In other oversights, there's no accelerometer onboard.
To rotate the screen
you have to use this needlessly complex ribbon of hieroglyphics.
It's not difficult or dangerous, but it is still just another speed bump.
It all adds up to a device
that's impressive but for me falls a little short of justifying its price.
Don't get me wrong
But you know that's not the only competition.
Euro, assuming that display tech is all it's cracked up to be.
I'm glad the Nova 3 Color is on the market and it definitely fills a niche.
I just hope the next version is a little more refined, or, priced a little more palatably.

android tablets are in this really weird place right now
google has pretty much given up on them and samsung is still trying to make android tablets
but let's face it
nobody is going to beat the ipad when it comes to popularity
i guess is amazon
amazon continues to push out their fire
tablets and one of the most compelling fire tablets is the amazon fire 7 tablet
it's a 7 inch tablet
that only costs 50 dollars
yes fifty dollars but is it worth it
let's start off with specs because that's where you can really see this fifty dollar price tag
come in this
tablet comes with a mediatek 8163 processor
it's a quad-core 1.3
gigahertz cpu with one gig of ram to say
this tablet is slow is an understatement
it is beyond slow apps
take forever to open up
i even find myself
so what can you expect
and that's what you really want to keep in mind with this tablet the price tag
it's an all plastic tablet with a really basic design
you can't expect much for 50 and you can really see
it's a cheap tablet by just looking at the design the display has some rather large bezels
uh and at least it has a headphone jack
that is a plus
the charging port is another area where you can see that
they cut back to save money
yes it's really bad
it's a 7 inch
it's just not very bright
it has one bottom firing speaker as well which is horrible
it's a horrible sounding speaker
it gets loud enough
i guess um but it just sounds really muffled
well it has a camera
don't use the cameras
the cameras are also horrible
you've probably used before
fire os is completely different from just regular android in fact
you won't even find google play services on this tablet
you won't get the official youtube application
but that might be more work than it's actually worth
most of the popular
applications are here like netflix
hulu disney plus is also on the amazon app store
the issue is uh storage
it only comes with 16 gigs or 32 gigabytes of storage
the good news is that it does have a expandable storage slot up to 512 gigabytes
so that's actually really good
you can really raise the storage capacity up quite a bit
and because it's running fire os
you're gonna have all of amazon's services already installed they're pre-installed on this tablet
it's kind of a cluttered and complicated mess
there's really no satisfying way of navigating
they kind of throw all of that at you
and you're kind of stuck with it
so that's actually a really useful feature
this tablet comes with most android tablets
so that's something that this tablet has over the ipad
that's pretty good right so the question is who is this tablet for and is it worth it
well i have to keep going back to the price tag keep in mind
it's only fifty dollars
you're not paying much for this tablet
so this tablet is perfect for children
because you don't have to worry about losing it or it getting broken it only costs 50 bucks
that's why it's perfect for them
if you have children that tend to break things
this tablet is perfect for them
not only is it durable
because it's all plastic but it's only 50 dollars
i don't know if i could say that more
i probably said that about 10 times already
but you have to keep that in mind when you're considering purchasing this tablet
i mean it's perfect for that
it's so cheap
you rather have something that's cheaper just in case you lose it or get stolen
this tablet is perfect for that
so is it worth it
well once again
it's so cheap that of course it's worth it
so you don't miss any of our new videos
are you ready students parents and teachers here we go
I offer to you take last

that was down to around 225
PPI pixels per inch
PPI display you won't notice any issues in its day-to-day usage
it's only the 30
PPI less than apples on iPad 2019
that being said the screen can get extremely bright as such
hopefully the class will release a fix for this soon
overall though it's a great display with good colors
viewing angles and good thoughts responsiveness
this makes it extremely fragile
and you all want to consider investing in a third-party screen protector
we're completely skipping over a fingerprint scanner as well as face
it was the first tablet to come out
so what does this mean in laymen terms
SD card commerce
look at no class and this time we will talk about the cameras
and that's it
the picture
quality is not amazing as you would expect
but make sure the room is well-lit low-light photography is too grainy and the pictures
turn out onion soup unusable
here camera is only 5mp
front camera is only 2
so how good is the battery life
well as we mentioned the p10 eats the racks
the EC 9 8 6 3 a chipset which is optimized for lower power consumption

hi in skyyy and welcome to hardware heaven today
we are going to be taking a look at the wiki pad gaming
Tamplin I'm very excited to be reviewing this product for a wide variety of reasons
it is a mobile gaming tablet with a built in and removable controller
so you can have more control over your mobile games like you would with a console game
it's very very interesting so first off
I'm gonna start with what we've got inside the box then
we of course have the wikipad tablet which is a 7 inch
you won't have to worry about that
it pretty much works exactly the same way
it's a pretty standard tablet if anything it looks like a giant galaxy
HDMI port there
on the back
it works perfectly
fine it's a similar size to that of the iPad Mini
Google Chrome you can go to the Google Play Store
it all works perfectly fine your calendar etc etc
we do have some additional game options on here for example
my particular favorite is a game called a Reaper
it's completely free up to a level 10
there's no microtransaction shift
you basically players this repr
who has a really big sword
it's like the pale swordsman
you have to kill things and complete quests and upgrade your armor and stuff like that
it's always the ice storm test that you'll run
and this actually got a score of 3629 the graphics cool with 3221 with a physics score as 6512
another thing that
I'll always pay attention to is how responsive it is as you can see
I can slide on the tablet with complete ease
there's no sort of lag
it's really responsive when going around sort of websites and browsers and things like that
it's very responsive there's no latency or lag when pressing any buttons
occasionally there is a little bit of graphics lag
I absolutely love the design
I love the fact that the tablet slots into the controller and then it's completely stable
but that's just a little picky thing on my behalf
the analog sticks work perfectly
they're extremely responsive
and we've also got our triggers on here as well like you would expect from any controller
I feel that it's a good width
7 inches is a nice width to have your hands apart and I really really like that
you can hold it comfortably
you have to bear in mind that this is mobile games
this is a mobile gaming device for games that you can find on
App Store's that you would normally play on something like your phone
I really like the way they have designed it
and you simply plug in
I much prefer this on a tablet
you've got a bigger screen
it's really really nicely into the controller
everything is secure
doesn't feel like anything's gonna fall out
so you're getting that out not having to worry about draining
I think is a complete bargain
it works extremely well
it's got a huge variety of games that are compatible with it and it's endlessly growing
is this kind of thing
gets more and more popular
there will be something for everyone on the app store but just bear in mind
you should definitely check it out if you are a mobile gaming lover personally for me
I'd much prefer it to the ones with the kind of controller
and then you attach a tablet or a phone on top
I don't really like that
it looks unstable and it doesn't look like the products on its own
it does just look like you're attaching a controller to a device with which fans me
I don't think looks very nice so I hope you liked this review
make sure to check out
leave a like and subscribe to this channel
if you've enjoyed this video and I'll see you next time bye
which is the nova 3 color so for the remainder of this video
which we're not gonna actually talk through
it's more of an exhibition style
because we have videos individually on both of these and explanatory videos on what collido is
we're just gonna leave it up to you guys to look at it
see how you like the vibrancy the color saturation everything else about it
inch is the nova 3 color
enjoy so you
what's going on i'm ryan from technically
well i'm checking out the dragon touch
i 10x windows
10 tablet the dragon touch
meaning that does not look washed out from the side
video playback works well allowing you to stream
YouTube videos in HD with minimal stutter
the tablet also features 64 gigs of built-in storage with almost 49 gigs available out of the box
along the side
you'll find a headphone jack
the charging port a full sized
the building cameras don't take stellar pictures
but they get the job done and work fine for a quick Skype call
the tablet also comes pre-loaded with the mobile versions of Word Excel and PowerPoint
10x is ideal for school and business
alike the detachable keyboard case
is it very easy to transport and the familiar
Windows 10 interface allows you to use your favorite applications to get work done
thanks for watching
oh hi guys today
I've just received my tech lusty
ten master t10 tablet
this is a flagship tablet brand-new
just come out
what's in your box first
okay so repeated apart
I'm actually quite surprised
it's arrived with the battery
100% fully charged
so just ready to go now
this is literally just as I love unboxed
it turned it on and this is what we've what we've actually got so
so that's no great issue first impression it comes across
it's the clarity of the screen
that is it really is remarkable
this is by far the best screen
I've seen on
any budget tablet phenomenal phenomenal sharp
yeah we need to install some apps on it and and get it going to be connected to the internet first
I know interestingly we've got a an update of stop button there
this is straight out of the box
it's nearly completed downloading of great
now take we are so now
we're updated to the latest version
it's nice to actually see that with
we've got some current updates to fix any inevitable
bugs are gonna be an ongoing issues so yeah big tick
they're tech lost
its first class below
so one of the new features of the tech
I just touch it briefly
it's back on works exceptionally well
so let me just show you how to set that up
if we go to settings here somewhere fingerprint right
confirm your password at fingerprint
I've already put two but I'll do it again
for the purpose of this demonstration so add fingerprint and put your finger on the sensor
now it's a case of just keeping moving you finger around lift finger
then touch the sensor again you'll fingerprint detected
we keep doing this until we manage to to fill up the bar
my hands of it sweat is exceptionally hot here today
we've gotten there we go
I just try that again
there we go back on so yeah great function and certainly
we're all done
there makes it certainly easy to turn on and off so where we are now also included in
the package is this which appears to be a standard
SIM card PIN now
this tablet hasn't actually got some just hasn't got the facility for a SIM card
what this is actually is why we have lost it there
we are on the edge with the with the speaker
you've got a a micro
don't get confused about it's only for for you actual micro SD card
I just want to talk about the charger
but it doesn't actually mention that it is actually the fast charger so yes
it is a fast charger
it's a pump
Express charger with five seven nine and 12 volt amperes
this water mattered
I've no complaints at all with it
the the processor that's fitted is a 64-bit mediatek mt6752 except for playing games
it's perfect
let's just have a look at the the pros with it one
it's gotten an hour mininum case and coupled with the touch sensor on the rear
I'm very impressed with that
the speaker or your speakers on it dual stereo speakers
I think for the first time certainly first tablet
I've had it's light enough to use without using a Bluetooth speaker
front camera is 13 megapixel and the rear is 8 and the results are astonishing again
you know cheap budget tablets
you all know what they're like
the cameras are always always have been a compromise on this tablet
they're not they really are good photographs certainly for talking online talking to friends
the front-facing camera is just amazing
absolutely they may
what else have we got
there's GPS installed as well and the battery life
well it's that that's another big surprise
I suspect it will probably run for about ten hours
and of course then
we've got the fast charger as well
so when you need to charge it
put the charger in
no yeah it would be nice to have a compass to to accompany the GPS
I think the only other thing possibly would be no SIM card but there again I expect
we'll save a future model down the line with the SIM card fitted again
being a large 10 inch tablet
most people are going to be using this around the home so um not a big issue really
I I certainly wouldn't want to be walking about or out and about with this
so so that for me just using it on the
Wi-Fi is absolutely fine so overall impressions with it
well it's it's perfect
I can't really fault it in any way
I'm struggling to find anything to actually fall with this tablet at all
so yeah there you are
that's the tech last master t10 tablet
hey there everyone
I've got a bit of a different thing
you hear guys today not my usual stuff those of you that watch my live
streams are probably already familiar with the sound of my voice
those of you
that aren't well annoying so not too long ago
huion approached me to review one of their graphic drawing tablets now
I've been using the same
quick little background on me if you're not familiar with my channel already
I do digital art and animation
I have been
I'll be reviewing for this video is the QE on Inspira q1
1k before we get into the pros and cons and speed painting whatnot
I wanted to quickly go over the boxing now
packaging aesthetics hold no bearing on the actual quality of the product
I know but I really appreciate a pretty box
everything was super secure
no amount of crazy shipping shenanigans
let's dive right into it
starting with the pros
the drawing surface of this tablet is silky smooth
I don't know how else to really describe it
drawing on it is such a pleasant tactile experience
it's nearly eight times more sensitive which is crazy considering
I paid roughly the same for my old one back then as the q1 1k costs today
I was worried about you
know delay and feedback but it is as responsive as responsive can get
I never felt like the brush was lagging behind or jumping around
the q1k has an active area of around 11 by 7 inches
which to me is just about perfect not too big that
I have to worry about
is cat hair in the bottom of the pen
holder is a little piglet compartment for keeping all of the eight extra pen
nibs that the tablet comes with as well as a little place for the wireless adapter now
I don't travel with my tablet that often but I've dealt with enough USB
is that taking
I'm not going to forget this
vital piece of equipment anywhere
one of the features of the physical tablet is a shortcut
lock that when toggled disables the other shortcut buttons on the the tablet surface
which if you're like me and have a nasty habit of accidentally pressing
those buttons is really convenient and now on to the cons unfortunately
I did run into a few hiccups when installing drivers but it was kind of almost entirely my fault
remember kids when the instructions tell you to install the drivers before plugging in the device
it's not too big of a problem but it can be a little inconvenient
Wacom I worked with before
the pen was not battery-powered it just was it just existed
I'm no stranger to charging my digital devices
Wacom tablets
the pen does not have an eraser side
it's not too big of an issue for me
I have no fear however because it does have an alternative option on the pen
one of the buttons is automatically set to switch your brush to an eraser which is great
those pin buttons are just really easy to accidentally press
what can I say
my last issue happened near around the end of my picture
I started to get this weird glitch
I don't know how else to describe it occasionally when I was doing some quick frequent strokes
the pen would spaz and duplicate layers and shift stuff around
I am overall very pleased with my experience
it outperforms my old tablet in just about every area for an extremely reasonable price
hey cafe crew
Colin Smith here and today
I've got something really exciting for you
this was my very first
Wacom tablet just to show you
how far is coming
this was a ox-head - and you can see here
tear everything out of the box here
I've got all the goodies right here
so let's start with
what do you get first of all you get the tablet and as you can see here
it's really quite slick
it's one flat smooth surface and I'll talk about that a little bit
it's got some decent weight to it
it's actually made out of aluminum on the back so it actually feels quite nice
we've got the pan of course we've got the
Wacom pen too and yes
is these little accessories which we're going to jump into
this baby here works by default on
Bluetooth and from my tips here I have noticed that the Bluetooth works really well
there's no lag or anything
one of the things that they're in mind is if it doesn't work right away
don't forget to update the firmware and
I'll show you exactly how to do that right now
what you want to do is just tap on here
one of these is touch
you can actually just turn a little switch so you don't have to worry about it now
we want the touch ring to do
it's really nice and then when you grab the pin and you start to draw it
this is where it feels really nice
so let's look at the base for example that's a different type of base here
instead of that long one we used to have its countries
one of the nice things you can do here is a little hole and you can just go and pull it like that
the other thing we've got is these nice little rings
I want to put
I don't know maybe I want to put some red on there
I can just pull the red off
I can identify this pin because it has a little red
it's going to paint now one of the things
I'm noticing because this thing is over 8,000 levels of pressure sensitivity
that's one of the big changes
eight thousand one hundred and ninety-six
there's a ton of different things you can have it to do
we could do the back button
those we've got a front and a back button here so I'm going
have the front button sits or right
click the back button said to the brush tools
well what are those brush tools going to do now
we can go to those easily enough
Photoshop we hit that back button
we can move this around and we can do different things with it there
of course we can hit that
little cog at that little wrench there
it's a hard to put in full
so what else we got here
well we've got the touch
we've got many things we can do with the touch
we can do the touch options here
let me just using my finger right now
there's a lot of other things we can bring up other controls
they will do different things
and you can see you know
we've got photoshop shortcuts panel shortcuts
and there's a bunch of different things you can do here
so you can customize some of these gestures which is pretty awesome
okay so here we are in our
Express keys so
why don't we under photoshop
let's choose the application
so here's the thing we can add different applications in here and have these
let's change this to a keyboard shortcut
what if you want to cool it okay
so we've got the touch ring and you can see you know
there's the toggle there in the middle we can have it do different things
zoom cycle layers brush size rotate
so there's plenty of in-depth things on how to use the tablets there what
I really want to do
I like it
I like the way it works
I like the way it feels
so there's the before image
there's the after image just playing around a little bit on this tablet so overall what
I recommend it put that about
you need to get a tablet because without a tablet
it's kind of like working with markers on paper which works fine or you know both point pen
it's great you can draw
you can do a lot of things but there's no pressure sensitivity
you can't do shading when you have a pressure-sensitive tablet such as this
you can shade like you would draw with a pencil so you can create gradients
it's essential so really
this is the tool you want to get and so
I would recommend this one without any reservation
it feels really nice
I love the fact that works wirelessly the Bluetooth is no lag
there's no delay and weres fantastic
of course you can plug it in if you want
I like the fact
I'm probably not going to plug it in
in fact one of the things I hate about the new MacBook
Pro is the touchpad so I'm probably gonna
I hope you enjoyed it
what do you think are you using a
Wacom tablet right now
are you impressed by this
is this something you want so anyway guys
thanks for watching until next time
I'll see you at the cafe
hey guys just a quick forward before we actually start the video
I would like to mention that
this is not a sponsored review
this was a replacement for my old
it seems to be their new entry-level beginner tablet
they don't sell the artists anymore
so not only is the cheapest emotional sports well tablet
I could get
it's also the replacement for my old tablet so
I'm going to be comparing it to a lot in this review
I was not contacted to do this
this was entirely me
everything I said was completely honest because I don't believe in
I don't believe in a dishonest review
any negatively affects people
that are watching it so once again
so that's all
this was exactly the case
the redesigned the tablets
they've gone for here is absolutely stunning
and it's fastly kind of farming fresh more than the older tablets like the artist
NS and it honestly
it looks so much smarter on the desk underneath this
there's a little bit of card separating the new tablet from the rest of the box
and you get this nice little you know carton inside of this
is your blue cleaning
cloth that you can see me displaying wonderfully here you have your smudge guard which is so you
don't leave any debris or grease or sweat on your tablet screen while you're drawing it resistance
Ferentz this is your warranty policy
there is another box and this contains your wires to set up now inside of this it comes with a
Mac adapter the HDMI and USB leads for your computer as well as the
it's a combined lead so it also plugs into your tablet
I believe it's 2008
anything past 2011 needs a new adapter but I'm not sure speaking of adapters
I'm using the United Kingdom pin set because I live in the UK
next up is my favorite feature of this entire box
it's what
I like to affectionately named the pen tube which keeps your pen and all your spare lips inside
it's got an interesting invention
I'm more traveling
and it's also really unique and makes the most of its space now on to the actual tablet itself
it's actually surprisingly easy
there's also a red
USB that comes with the pack and this actually connects the USB adapter
you're also provided words
turn the plug socket on and your tablet
it's ready to go drive
a set up for the tablet was also incredibly easy
you simply go to their website and download
the driver specified wait for it to install and then open up and let it run
after this you need to reboot the tablet and you're pretty much all ready to go however
it was a major major difference to the extra pen artists hats
this like the unique tabla
it has six sort cookies and one touch bar
the touch pad seemed to be a popular feature within tablets
these days and that is by no means an issue
it's very thin
it's very light and it's definitely a wonderful tablet to work with
the pen is battery free
I don't have too many
I already finished the image
this image one is a companion piece to the artwork
HD display more pen pressure levels and an overall better performance with a bigger screen
it's absolutely great
being able to switch from an eraser to your stylus by flicking your pen is fantastic
I'm used to having to do it through the pen barrels
this was brilliant
it feels so much more actually stood drawing experience
it makes your workflow faster and it feels more natural one drawing this is a feature
this tablet retails for 199
it's no longer valid
unfortunately but it did get me about it
got me about thirty pounds off
this tablet only cost me one hundred and seventy pounds and it's fantastic value for the money
you're upgrading from a pad tablet of this is your first tablet
this is definitely a fantastic option to go with
obviously if you don't want to spend out this much money
I still fully recommend the Veeck range
NS lasted me for years before eventually
kicking the buck here and given how sturdy and improve this design looks
I think it'll be far far more when it comes to the artist
12 that's all
I really have to say on the table overall
I think it's a fantastic piece of care and great for any beginner
10's new actually cost more than this tablet
did it was 300 pounds for the artist 10s
meanwhile this was only a hundred ninety-nine at full price
how long do this function just five
my office 10s and continues to function just fine for my art is 12
that's all I really have for now
I hope you enjoyed the video don't forget to
Like and subscribe and let's art by nature out
hi Dave Taylor here again and this time
I'm looking at the Samsung Galaxy Tab E
that's this and this is a just barely under 10 inch tablet
they call them the 10 inch tablets
Wi-Fi as do all tablets but it also has 3G now three G is a cellular connection
and you have to actually subscribe through your cellular service
I actually do that
a lot with soccer matches
but that's a whole nother
that's plenty for a day
that's even plenty for a transatlantic flight
so this is really nice it also being part of the Samsung line
it actually supports microSD
so you can pop
you might want to put on here
this thing's really quite a little powerhouse
and you think immediately as I do
Wow that'd be great for my kids and here's what's great
Samsung actually has something called kids mode and kids mode
this is running android
5.1 lollipop not clear what their upgrade path is for the newer versions of android
so that's worth knowing
it does have an audio jack somewhere
here is an audio jack so for all of you people paranoid about your iPhone
7s not having an audio jack
this does your audio jack cool okay and it also supports
Bluetooth 4.1 so
you don't need the audio jack go figure you can do it either way like
I said video playback at 1080p which is full HD and it supports Direct TV etc
that's really all you need to know except for one really cool thing
how much would you pay for this tablet
probably you're going to say a lot more than it costs
this is a 10 inch tablet
and if you're used to the world of iPads you're going to be saying oh
I don't know $5.99 $7.99
that's crazy and expensive
so you can pick one up for yourself through samsung comm or this particular
what's up guys chicks here bringing you a review for the connect 7
3.5 millimeter jack mini HDMI micro SD card slot and the charger port
which is a micro
Windows fully within 10 seconds so
eleven point six seconds booted to desktop
and it's very nippy
actually it's smooth in operation
let's open to something is urging the browser
okay let's go up register
you got to log a pixel camera at the front and a two megapixel camera at the back
the weight of the device is 280 grams and is eight millimeters thin light and portable
what's unique about this device is the solid-state drive
it didn't boot to ten seconds but 11.6
I'm not really complaining
that's pretty fast full up faster than my PC
at least battery
life is around 6 hours depending on what you're doing on
it handles everything very well
I've tested this out
it's called browsing the web watching movies
here's the Microsoft App Store so you got all the latest apps
they're all the free apps and the paid apps which is really good
ok just installed sonic - a game to see what it's like playing the game on this games
play the games play very well on this
I hope you enjoyed the video
thanks for watching
today we're taking a peek at the dragon
touch max 10 tablet
let's get into it
hey folks welcome back to techgooch and today
we're taking a peek at a tablet
this is actually
i think um i think i've done an android tablet once or twice in the past
i thought why not
i haven't done one for a while and if nothing else that gets me
uh looking down though
this is not going to be something
that's going to compare to my ipad pro right
it isn't my ipad
pro is a 700 bees
i'm actually going to be comparing this to like the fire
um there's going to be other ones out there as well
this is a octa-core tablet
in that regard it does have an ips
screen uh 1200 by 1920 so a little bit better than hd technically um and it
actually the screen's not too bad
i ran it on all of the stuff and that way i had something to judge it against now
i don't think you know i didn't expect that to even do close to any of my bigger items
i really wanted to see how it did
compared to like the iphone 10 iphone 10s
that was the the big ones
so i'm going to show you that here in a second
here's how to do the power
here's how to do that
here's how you do how you do this
how you slide
how you unlock make sure you activate your warranty
obviously we do have a front-facing camera
it is usbc for its power charge
and that's where the sd card goes is right down in that slot
i don't like that i'd rather have a door but then again once you put the sd card
it's not kind of designed where you don't know it didn't come with an sd card
i had just an extra cheapy um small one that was lying around and uh yeah
so that's that's where that goes
um now i have let me uh sign into the tablet real quick and there we are so now
we're this is running android pie
you could do certain things with it
i'm not going to go through the apps
this is more on the on the tablet performance itself
um it's pretty much running uh almost stock version of it
that's from what i can tell
um i don't do a whole lot with android and you know
obviously it's more
there's a lot more people that know more about it than i do but it
now i used geekbench 5 for its results
uh and so we can go with that right now
it's nowhere near the power that even a 5th gen ipad has so to be honest about it
if you can you know the 5th gen ipad ran
but if you look at device to device uh samsung galaxy a7 lg g2
uh samsung galaxy note
um but that's kind of what you're thinking so for 139 bucks
it's what you would expect good for browsing good for watching videos
good for simple tasks
you're not going to do anything heavy gaming on this thing it's just really not built for it
it does do gaming
does you know it's similar to those older devices
i would give it that
i'm probably in the few weeks that i've been using it
i i never go to debt
i just never do
uh camera's not too bad um it's it's a 140 tablet
it's it is what it is
it's not too it's not bad it really isn't um i wouldn't hesitate
i've hacked the fire tablets before i've done a lot of things but this is already blank
slated so dragon touch for 140 bucks
yeah it's it's 140 tablet
it's what it is
it's not gonna replace the ipads
yeah it's pretty awesome
let me know
share like subscribe
um not a bad little tablet um you know i wish i could show you more
i mean i could show you how it runs on this
i mean yeah we could watch a movie together
i guess but um more than anything
i think
the responsiveness is decent
um but it's not crazy amazing and the screen itself
um it's not a bad display
it really isn't
i can't say bad things about it
it's it's not the ipad pro that i'm used to but it's not supposed to be
it is nowhere near the cost of that thing
we'll see you soon
hey this is rick waldron with taylor
data systems uh we have jeff teague from honeywell today
and we're going to discuss the new honeywell rt10 tablet jeff
you brought one with you
didn't it
sure did rick
you know we've talked about it
it's an android and a windows tablet
you can get either or the android side is running mobility edge
it's got the mobility edge strategy
that honeywell has a couple things that are unique about
it are include well number one the mobility edge but number two
we have a short range and a long-range scanner in this thing
we've uh we've developed this
uh scan engine that uh we're calling it flex range internally and it um it's it
the scan engine is small enough and that it'll it'll fit in a product like this
like the tablet
it's the only tablet in the industry that has a long range auto ranging imager
the other thing is is unlike some of the commercial grade tablets
it also has a user replaceable battery
so you don't have to send the battery in if it should fail
that will help you do that
they go well
jeff thank you very much for coming today
yeah thanks for having me
i appreciate it rick
you're welcome you
hi everyone this is to welcome to yet
another tablet review
I have reviewed a lot of tablets on my youtube channel as well as online blog
I have this new tablet by XP pen this is called the star zero 6
this is actually a wireless tablet
so let's check it out
this is the packaging box for the star
0 6 wireless tablet as you can see
my box did not arrive in a very good condition
it's pretty smashed up but thankfully there's no physical damage to the tablet
let's take a look at the key features of this tablet
let's take a look at the things included
we have the tablet
this is the pen
this is the pen stand
this is the USB Drive with Windows and Mac driver on it
is that a manual and the resist glove here
there's a little note if you want an extra month of warranty you can like their
the build quality is quite solid
this will light up
there are six physical shortcut buttons
Photoshop brush sizes or zoom in and zoom out
it has audible clicks
when you turn this you can turn it and clockwise or counterclockwise
overall the design is very clean and simple
this is the working area ten by six inches
there there's loop here that can hold a pen
this is how it looks like when the pen is in the loop
I feel that this is a bit fragile
so be careful not to callus anyway
I seldom ever use this on the back
there are six rubber feet and this is where the battery is
this is the power toggle switch for the tablet
I like the fact that this is removable
so if there's anything wrong with the battery you can replace it very easily
let's take out the USB receiver
this is very small
be careful not to lose this and this is the USB Drive with the drivers on it this
is the pen understand
the pen areas rather lightweight feels sturdy enough
here's a bit hollow as well but I think it's good enough
holds quite well quite comfortable
even though there's no rubber grip it still goes quite firmly because of the matte texture
there are two buttons on the side and tips is here you move very slightly no different from others
Dollars and right at the back there is no eraser there is also no much hugging
we call this ten
it doesn't need to be powered by battery which means it will never run low on the battery
so that's great
and this is the stem you can put the ten on it horizontally or vertically like this
let's take a look at the back
this small hole at the back can be used to remove the tip from the pan
you just have to push it in and choose the pen at an angle
you can remove the tip very easily
the replacement tips are inside
that are inside
I have already installed the driver
if you are left-handed you can change it here
your second temperature is monitor
you can choose
how the tablet is going to map on to the monitor so
maybe you just want to use half of the tablet for whatever reason you can change it
here is tap for the expert keys so you can assign specific keyboard shortcuts to the six
so that's all there is to change the function of the scroll wheel you click here
I have reassign it
this light will light up
I've just connected a charging cable to this tablet so this light is lit up right now
the good thing is when the tablet is due charging you can still use it
you can still draw with a pen no problem at all all right
let's has the strokes
this is photoshop cs5 on the Mac
so let's try to see the pressure sensitivity works
it does work quite well
I mean zoom in to let you see how smooth the strokes are this is at 400% zoom and the strokes
I can see some light and jitter select jitter there so not 100% smooth
maybe about 90 to 95% it's smooth
it seems that drawing at 100%
I get a slight jito now
I have zoomed in to 200% so I'm going to show you the thin strokes that I drew earlier
this is now much smoother
let me zoom into 400 again so all those jitter
they are gone usually when drawing details
I like to use zoom in
so it's not really a problem
I seldom draw at 100% zoom
this is 200% zoom and
I'm using right now
so the strokes
they appear perfectly fine
when you do cross hatching the strokes they taper very nicely so this is great some tablets
it's quite smooth as well
this is good mr. illustrator cs5 on the Mac
pressure does not work by default
if you want to check out the 100% screenshot of the files you can visit my tax review
I will put the link in the video description below so the strokes a paper very well
- the transition is very smooth from into thick and unlike Photoshop when you draw with mini Bank
at 100% the strokes are very smooth
this is mischeif pressure works very well
this is coyote sketches
Pro pressure looks here
the dry surface is quite smooth but it has a slight tactile
feel which feels really good when drawing on it this is
Krita pressure works very well
here you can also use the scroll wheel to change the brush size
they work pretty well
there are some features for example with illustrator
drawing they are really minor issues are not do breakers so overall
I think this is a pretty decent tablet
the build quality is quite good
I will put a link in the video description below
so that's all for today's review
thanks for watching
I hope this is helpful
see you in the next video bye you
Oh today is a special day
I know what you might be thinking
look two videos in one week
are you crazy no
I'm not okay
it's time for a new one
so the tablet that they said to me is a 15 inch tablet display
I'm not used to the single
this is a weird angle
it's a screen that you can draw on
I've always wanted a screen that I can draw on that's not an iPad okay
there's a difference between an iPad and a drawing tablet without further ado my sister
Brenna's opening it let's go
I don't know if you already have noticed but it is kind of already open
I just wanted to take a little peek okay
I just wanted to take a peek
it's been sitting here for two weeks okay and I just want to check if it was in there okay
I didn't actually open it though so there it is BAM man to see this there
okay wonder what it could be
I already smell it I already smell the newness
ooh oh now
I can finally take some minute check it out BAM there it is thank you for sponsoring me
I cannot wait to open this
what and a bunch of cables hell
yeah let's do
that's genius okay
let me just tell you
you can't express yourself through language just express yourself with art
what is it so hard hello once
I feel like tape or something
that's like keeping this together that
I'm just completely missing
wait so this tablet is geared towards a all levels of artists
we got beginners
you know intermedia expert artists like myself
oh no it's got a smelter
Oh looks like we've got a tablet
there's a tiny globe all right
oh but it's spandex it stretches
oh hell yeah
I am a professional artist now
I have I have a glove
they even pack candy in here
oh yeah I love candy
that's not candy
then here's the tablet very nice and fit a very portable
I like look at this beautiful display
okay well actually maybe
I'll do that when I install it
let's go let's go
so here's the box
this is what comes in the box
ASMR this is for you
oh hell yeah look at that display so upon first inspection
it looks like there's a lot of buttons here
I'm guessing to zoom in
this is the button - oh hey yeah and if you look at the side there's a power button
Wow feels a little bit
flimsy feels a little bit light
but maybe that's what you want as an artist
I don't know I guess we'll see what I'm drawing tap
it's pretty light but this is like cool
let's start drawing voiceover time awesome
let's do it so this is my voice outside of first secret
it's not muffled
this is a little speedrun of me drawing a camera boot
okay first off a little background
what about the caribou
this is someone who won the 10k raffle that
I had months ago and I finally am drawing his persona so thank you
Rennick for letting me draw your fur soda
you can do that or if you want to have it tilted up to
this is probably going super fast
this whole entire drawing took like four or five hours but during this sketching phase
it wasn't even registering
I would have to press down a little bit harder for
it's a completely register
where if you're just like barely touching the screen
they will register
I did not have that problem with my previous tablet so I think that's
that's one of the biggest critiques however
man as far as the eraser toggling I was talking about earlier
that actually turned out to be really nice
I would hold down that button when I want to erase and I erase wait and then when I let go
it would not erase it anymore for this pen
that took some getting used to but once
I started doing that
it made it make things a lot easier
I'm just agree to kind of like it
is it like touch sensitive
the answer is no you cannot this is uh only registers for pen movement and honestly
I don't see the use of the touch capabilities
because you're not able to pan with this pen
I've been using my my trackpad to do that
okay so after the sketch
I moved on to the liner usually
I thought it would draw if that makes any sense
I didn't know where my pen was landing on
this is my first display that
I'm drawing on so I don't
but it wasn't really that major of a problem
it was just kind of a something that bugged me
I'm traditional so I wore the glove and it
okay one of the one of the big things that I also noticed was
it was a little bit of a step down
display okay now
I'm gonna talk about the shading because the shading is the most important part for me
it always looks so vastly different going from coloring to shading because like flat colors
the painting is just 2d right but then once you start shading
I don't even know if this is the right way to do it so what I do is I
I actually don't think I really had many problems with it
it was very easy to do
I'd have to say that
I've been doing all these years
and that's what
I've been trying to do this whole time
so this tablet I think it's on Amazon for $379 I believe or 399
the foreign dollar tablet 15 inch display right
so it's already quite a bit
it's a display that you can draw on then it also works at like an external display
so is this article tablet worth the money
I have to say yes
it is overall
my drawing
experience was not really all that frustrating
I had a lot of fun drawing with this tablet
if you want to be a pro artist like myself just give this tablet
you'll be pro
I'm kidding so yeah
this is the drawing this is a the handsome caribou
Rennick and I had a lot of fun drawing him
so thank you artists
all for sending me your tablet to review
this was definitely a lot of fun to do and it was a nice little change of content
BAM look at that beautiful
drop ooh okay
I'm gonna get back in first
you can say goodbye
so that was my review
so thank you all for tuning in and I will see you next video bye-bye
hey i'm ryan from technically well and i'm checking out the dragon touch i eight pro
swipe down from the top right and tap
shown here play very well for those interested the Geekbench multi-core score comes in at 2011
meaning that you can view it from an angle and the display does not look washed out
it's great for playing games and watching
Netflix or YouTube videos while the 8 inch screen is fine for Android
so you're not stuck trying to tap on the small screen elements the slim form factor
makes it very portable whether you're carrying it between school or work on the side
you'll find the power and volume keys as well as a headphone jack mini
HDMI out micro
USB charging port and micro SD card slot
Skype call overall
thanks for watching
i'll show you inside
we have the tablet display perfectly secured with foam along with
this comes the box which carries the components that make tablet function
we got this tube a flat screwdriver
perfect size glove one
half of the power adapter the pen itself a vga cable hdmi cable
a type-c usb cable the manual the other half of the power cable and a type c usb adapter
it was wedged between my computer chair
i can explain also if you open up the back
you'll notice that there's multiple nips just in case you lose him
break him or anything
you'll have multiple replacements
that is when i noticed that the other pen was again
the fact that it has multiple programmable shortcuts 20 to be exact
the screen is a full 1080p and crystal clear when it comes to drying it comes with a stand
it has a full 21 inch drying display
and it's very easy to install
watch yes i know a lot of you are asking
where is the thumbnail though
well here is the process
do do oh
just watch how i do you
why is this cheap
Android tablet so popular
it's only been available for a few weeks yet on Amazon
it has tons of five-star reviews with an average of 4.7
stars overall
is it worth the money
does it really live up to the hype
how does it compare to the similarly priced Kindle Fire HD 10
I guess we're gonna have to just unbox this thing and find out full disclosure
I was sent this by Vaughn
Keo in exchange for my honest opinion and I'm not gonna hold back on this one
I'll also be sharing my first impressions on design and build quality
so here's the headlines first of all
I'm going to take a deep breath
I do like that it has that older gen iPad
look though it doesn't feel like the most durable piece of tech I've ever held and ok
the bezels are instantly
No sabore but that's nothing unusual at this price bottom
that you simply don't need and tons of ads - unless you pay the amazon ransom first of all
let's talk about the screen
it's pretty sharp
nice and clear great colors but as you can probably see
I'm unable to leave the house to get a haircut right now
isn't really something that
I want to see too often
the rear and front facing cameras are decent enough for your average
charging speeds are pretty common with cheaper tablets so I can't complain here too much okay
edits of all the stuff
I review here on the channel
go leave a comment on my latest photo of what you'd like me to review next because yes
I do actually read the comments
Call of Duty mobile and pub G mobile
anyway it does make it very hard to get feedback on the edits you're making so
Netflix and YouTube has been totally fine performance
there's been no issues during regular playback at all so does the f30 live up to its own hype
I'd say that for your average consumer
I could see why the matrix pad s30 has so many five-star reviews in such a short space of time
it is more than equipped for browsing the internet reading
pretty much everything there that your average consumer would want a tablet for
so here's the pros and cons
it's got a black and white reading mode and zero bloatware thanks to Android Pi 9
the cons are slightly underpowered
well not quite with the fire 10
technically you're not even buying an Android tablet with the fire 10 HD
it is literally like accessing the internet through an Amazon billboard
of course there is a way to get around this and install
okay it's not quite as powerful but thanks to Android Pi 9 it's a true Android tablet
that isn't held to ransom by Amazon
and that's something that the fire 10
HD will never be straight out of the box
they are pretty cheap
pretty highly rated
so you might want to check out or you can check out my 5 best budget
A&C headphones by clicking here so pick one of those and I'll see you in the next video
hey what is up guys this is Alex from answered Tech and today
I'm going to be bringing you my review of the Wacom Intuos pen and touch tablet
this tablet is very thin which
starting on the top of the tablet
you have four macro keys
and then down below that you have a black bar with the
you have a ring
I'm going to talk about all the different customizability settings that come with this tablet
keep in mind that you may need to install a driver depending on what operating system you have
there are many different options as to what you can do here one of the things
you have the ability to change different settings such as pointer speed or double
click speed if you're planning on using this tablet as a trackpad
lastly you have settings for your radial menu
your radial menu allows you to have quick access to your most used functions this being my first
Wacom tablet is multi-touch so you have the ability to complete gestures in Photoshop
for example such as rotating the canvas and zooming in and out
I bought the Intuos pen and touch tablet mostly for photo editing
I'm photo editing
this tablet costs around 100
thank you guys so much for watching be sure to subscribe to the answered tech
YouTube channel as well as like this video if you enjoyed it and I'll see you guys in the next one
i love this tablet for my kids
what's really nice about it is
it's a perfect size for their hands
they can hold it and grip it really well
is this app called kiddos
it's perfect for them
because it has age-appropriate things on it
my kids are better at this than me
and so that's some of the things you can do
but that's how you go home by pressing the bottom here but you have safari on here
you have duo you have family group
it is connect it to wi-fi and it's ready
hey what's up
everybody dan here from text
at 360 now this right here is the matrix pad s8 from
Van kill this
affordable tablet comes with an 8 inch
IPS screen front and rear facing cameras
a quad-core processor
and so much more that we will discuss in today's video
now it's thin
it's very lightweight and for me that means
I have a lot more room in my tech bag
alright now let's go ahead and check it out so for those of you who are new to the channel
a big shout out to van
Keogh for connecting and sending this tablet out to me for review
I mainly use my tablets for reading magazines checking my email
maybe some online shopping
maybe a handful of games but I don't like I don't really care for the bulky tablets
I was happy to give it a try so inside the box
next is the s8 tablet
but we'll come back to that in just a minute also
now the first thing
it's composed of a light plastic backing with a matte finish
the company logo is right in the center and taking a closer look around the unit
you will find the power button
the volume up and down buttons on the top of the device is where you'll find them micro
USB port the SD card slot and the headphone jack
alright let's go ahead and quickly run down the specs out of the box
you get an 8 inch screen 12 1280 by 800 hi-def IPS display
and for those of you who don't know
IPS stands for in plane switching and best known for its rich color quality and viewing angles
alright the tablet also has a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core processor
2 gigs of ram 32
gigs of storage expandable up to 128 gigs
also the tablet has 2 cameras
it has a front facing camera
it's a 2 megapixel front facing camera and a 5 megapixel back camera now when
ok so I know I gave you some specs
but let's go ahead and actually unlock the tablet
and there's just after that you've called 8o 64 and what this will do or what it will tell you
it will give you some more some more info on your system ok so starting at the system
i have a 32 gig
SD card gear right now
so it's given me the extra storage space
I come over to CPU
they'll let you know that this is a quad-core 1.3
and some other things down here display display touch the screen resolution the network
it can only connect to 2.4 gigahertz
you know so
the 5 gigahertz band is not supported on this device
battery life is really good
I I guess I've had this been using this for the last three days
I guess and my battery level is like at 69% so oh I need to cut some notifications off
let's go ahead and turn that down there
very nice and then have some other information down here
I've been loving it since they since the company sent it out to me for review
I've been using it
I guess maybe two weeks now and honestly this is a very good budget tablet
I have no complaints
I'm locking it in place
I actually have to take something like this to push it in there
and so we'll have that clicks all stay in place so
these are your quick settings you have your Wi-Fi connection your Bluetooth
do not disturb auto-rotate smart saving mode airplane mode icon for it
I cover it out
let's check out some gameplay now
I'm not a big game or anything like that but I'm more than happy to give this
give this a shot for the sake of this video
I've been playing a little bit
I mean skills not all that but like I said all for the video and here we go well actually
I'm doing betting a thought
well any race that you can finish
guess it's a good thing okay so
this tablet has two cameras
the rear camera will yield the best quality in photos and videos
these pictures and videos that you're about to see were shot using the rear camera
even though the black guy can go first
okay now as you can see the videos in pictures
this is a decent tablet beautiful rich display and is very responsive and most of my apps now
I know a lot of us
listen thank you so much for your support and I really appreciate you taking time and watching
today's video
i don't know how to make intros though before we could start
this video is sponsored by galman
they sent me the m1220 drawing tablet
they just sent me this tablet for free for me to review
though i would suggest sending me a screenshot in the future would be a good idea
don't you think so
here's the packaging very sleek if i do say so myself i like the fact that it's all cardboard yet
it looks so clean
if you can say that
but i don't know this
precious box contains the tablet itself with a few
it also has the back for the tablet
this bag that contains the extra pen nibs inside
it worked perfectly
the only thing i didn't like about it is that um you're only allowed to draw in a specific area
that doesn't mean because my phone is small
it automatically does that when it's connected to a phone or or android or tablet
i would like to clearly mention that
the tablet only works for android devices
it doesn't work for ios so sorry apple users
it won't work for you so yeah onto the video though
let's talk about the tablet
i promise i won't talk a lot about numbers because that would be boring coming from me
so the 10 has 8192 level pressure sensitivity which is big enough
the whole tablet is 12 inches wide and it has 13 multimedia buttons which is very useful
i could just do that
and it also has eight express keys and one touch ring
i do love the rubber part of the pen
the light part
so imagine this
now you have the tablet we gotta download the drive of course though
i don't really have a computer to show you guys how what wait unless so
this is real easy
yeah yeah yeah
i'm going to be drawing while using the tablet with fire alpaca
that sans is mine
coat died two years ago
stop bringing it back and of course i know he's literally all bones and bald
uh so here's a story on how
i tried to hide that fact that i was a sans fan girl from my friend
let's start off with how i became a sans fan girl
this all started back on sixth grade
i'm that quiet art kid that still gets along with some people because they can quote unquote draw
i was also that kid that watches vines
i didn't know what i was going to
but i clicked on it anyway because it had the word funny on it
funny how minecraft youtubers now are also using that strategy to get views
don't you think though after that i got curious on what undertale is so
that's pretty hot
i mean cute
it also came across that uh sans anonymous comics
where sans would just flirt with a person
that's all gray
i'm not alone
uh so that happened but everything's all normal
our class suddenly got an announcement that we will have a transfer student to our class
we should probably speak in english but they said i didn't joking
don't know uh so like some days came by uh when they transferred
i noticed that this particular student was drawing a character
none other than betty from glitchtale with me peeking behind her
i went back to my suit with a panic
there's someone that knows undertale
that's also in my class
oh my gosh
their drawing is so cool
i got the courage to go to them again and suddenly nervously ask um is that undertale
they went uh yeah glitchtale betty
i could feel more panic inside my chest for even considering talking to them they were cool
we became good friends by them
drawing undertale made me inspired to draw more undertale and so i did
it was really fun to know that someone related to me
i've seen fandoms and not really undertale and other things as well
they also have good sense of humor
well if you all remember the old undertale fandom was is that we would all say bad
puns rude for snails and eating spaghetti was the most special meal back then
t-a-i-l mind you
i was 11 to 12 like 11 turning 12.
this is why you don't go to the internet when you're still young kids
she was inspired by undertale
i went undertale peasants oc because of course i was really lazy
uh as i remember she was made for us to cringe at
but i don't remember much that's all i remember but i suddenly liked her and shipped her with sans
i always show my art to my friend and they were always supported about it
i've read and i've even made my own fanfics so you could just find it yourself in a matpat
i don't even know what what i would say about it
my friend always knows what i'm doing since i always showed them what i've been doing
they're so cute together they said and i reply
oh no no no no no uh it was a dare for my cousin
i didn't want to do that
i kept doing that for months
and for fanfics i would say my cousin my non-existent cousin did that not me
i didn't want to do it but i did it anyways
because it's a dare
i even made alt accounts saying that
it went on to the point when i went to my friend and told him
hey the whole cousin thing wasn't true it was all me
uh i liked sans but i was really shy to tell you and they went
oh i know what so
that's the whole story of young me being all done
even though i am still dumb till this day i am still very hot
and that's enough
thank you for staying till the end of the video
if you want to know who that friend i was talking about
i will put their twitter in the description so please follow them
they're really cool
they've supported me when i made fano and wouldn't be and i wouldn't be here without them please
by the way spooky s1 has edited edited
all of this so please sure make sure to subscribe to her
please love you guys
this is the drawing i made with using the tablet
thank you to galman for sponsoring this video
i would like to talk to you guys for a screen tablet
excuse me i am begging you for a screen tablet
so yeah okay bye
hello my name is
Mark Warren from mark Warren photography and
I'm back with another video today
I'm going to do a little bit of a gear review
I was recently shopping for a new tablet pen tablet I was previously using the graph fire
3 which was a great tablet for me
I would lose connection so it had to go
this tablet is nothing short of amazing
not only is have the quick buttons for using quick configurations
I can basically use my finger to control the mouse
I can use two fingers to right-click I can use
three fingers left to actually change to a different window
three fingers right goes the other way
four fingers up does a function four fingers down does a function five fingers in Photoshop
I've got my actual tablet up here in Photoshop running and I'm going to show you just a few things
that are pretty cool about this tablet again
it'll pop up on the screen
what those buttons are configured for so right now in
Photoshop I have it set up for duplicate layers
there's an undo button
there's a shift button if I come down here to the bottom buttons
I've got it set up for control alt pan and scroll like said since this is touch sensitive
things set up there
circle clockwise makes it hard
brush circle
it's touch sensitive as well so
I can use it as a mouse
I don't like this change that it did so four fingers up
I can just go back and forth just by using four fingers up or down
I have a quick radial menu
I have an action setup
that's set up by a actual keyboard shortcut so I can run that action automatically
you know different brush capacities that
I might like use frequently
so it's really cool the customization and it's insane
I can toggle between the different colors or right-click there
touch is on and again
if you want to pull up more properties all you have to do is go to touch properties so
I'm going to pull that up and it's down here at the bottom of my screen
does undo four fingers down does redo tap and hold five fingers it saves the file so if
I want to save this file for any changes that I've done
I can automatically do that and again five fingers down brings up settings standard gestures
you have all kinds of standard gestures that'll do and again
and then it can double click to tap and click
two fingers will bring up right clicks
and then you've got zoom and rotate options by pinching
and closing your fingers and you can also rotate your images as well so
I turned that option off because I found my camera here
I found that a little bit annoying with the rotate option
especially if you're trying to zoom in or zoom out
three fingers left or right will navigate to different windows
it's pretty cool like that
all the customizations that you can do with this
in addition to that the pin is pressure-sensitive up to 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity
I am loving the things you probably
after having this tablet you may not even use a regular mouse anymore
I am enjoying it
I haven't experienced any problems like that at all
I think it's just a fabulous tablet fabulous tablet in value
so all in all
it's still a great value
this comes with some pre bundled software
so you can get Photoshop Elements 10
there's some plugins and some trial versions of Corel Painter
that comes with it if you want to download those once you register your product
this is an awesome tablet like said
it's few bucks more than the bamboo
I hope you enjoyed this video
my next video
we'll have more videos coming at you soon
Oh what is up my peepholes
this is your guy cly and welcome back to budget buys today
I want to talk to you about the Vaughn Kyo matrix pad s7
Android tablet a short time ago
oh but they are not sponsoring this video everything
I'm gonna be telling
you is my own opinion and has not been influenced in any way with the disclaimers out of the way
let's go ahead and crack this box open and see what's inside
QuickStart guides you're left with a bare screen and you have to find a protector
what you're actually here for is the tablet itself
so let me go ahead and rattle off some specs at you
this is a 7 inch
Android tablet running Android 9 pi
it has a 1024 by 600
IPS display 32 gigabytes of onboard memory
though it can be expanded with up to a 128 gigabyte microSD card 2 gigabytes of ddr3
RAM a Mallee T 820 GPU
you're going to find a reset
button the power button as well as the volume rocker on the top of the tablet
you're going to find the headphone jack
the microUSB port and underneath this protective flap
you'll find the micro
SD card finally on the back
you have the rear-facing camera as well as the speaker grille now
I know some of you are probably wondering about the audio quality
you can expect out of the past seven and four that
I've set up a little demonstration now
I played here
you're going to be able to pick up on a lot more
Netflix Hulu and Amazon Prime video
thanks to all of the ads
they shoved in there another reason
I'm using to be for this
part of the video is simply because they have public domain movies like the original
thanks to the fact that they forgot to apply a copyright attribution to the film itself
you don't have to drop $30 for 50 movies unless you want a physical copy but of course
it's actually a very competent device as you've probably already expected
this tablet has had zero issue running the standard casual gaming fare such as solitaire
they can get a little toasty though
most surprisingly is the fact that the on-screen controls were incredibly comfortable to use
I tend to hate those things and if I can
this game is a grid-based first-person dungeon crawling RPG
which just so happens to be a favorite genre of mine
think of this like the old eye of the beholder games but with an open-world though
I will admit the main reason I've been spending so much time with this game lately
you're good to go one of the other main things
I've been using this tablet for is text not only have
it does have a feature that
yes some people might be put off by the fact that it doesn't have 5 gigahertz
Wi-Fi nor does it record 1080p video
Clym signing off
it's stunningly sleek and its touchscreen capabilities
glass this allows for bright and full colors again
Intel i7 processing chip 16 gigabytes ddr3 RAM with 512 gigabytes of storage on an SSD hard drive
it's here you can see the true power of an upper ed laptop really coming through on this
otherwise tablet device
this device is hitting the market with an intention of collaboration equipped with premium
Bang & Olufsen audio and a world facing three multi array mic one thing
I love with this device
is the travel keyboard
that's included in the package
this keyboard is like typing on any regular laptop making it a great substitute device
that really gives you that
two-in-one feel / a tablet that being said there is of course an option for an on-screen keyboard
should you prefer it a helpful
addition to the
it's not hugely necessary
but for those hoping to use this device more for its tablet function it is recommended
the additional cost however is another 57 pounds 60 from the HP store as far as security features
go we have
Windows 10 Pro 64 options with Windows
hello fingerprint security a pin and passwords as with the majority of new
HP devices another thing I do like though this model we reviewed didn't house
it was the option for
this feature is something
I would like to see become more readily available in future
we found seven to eight hours to be more accurate
removing this issue overall
I was really impressed with the HP Lee x2 1030 g3 as a tablet device
it really is impressed by packing the punch of a laptop much larger and heavier than itself
the one drawback is the hefty price tag that currently accompanies the device coming in at 1954
well that's all for now
let us know what you think of the HP lex-2 1030 g3 in the comments below
and please remember to
Like and subscribe if you enjoyed the video until the next time
hi there well today
it's a rugged tablet as you can see by the sort of tough looking design but it's a 12 inch screen
high resolution runs
don't just build a tablet
they build a complete ecosystem of products around their tablets
for example behind me here and I'll just scroll across there
you'll see that
I use their motion computing f5
there's a desktop docking station
you can access them via ethernet and all sorts of things
spare car chargers car battery chargers
it's the fourth generation has well chip
that's built into this tablet so really really good on power
we found that this device ran a full day for us on Friday
so you can see that it is a device that is designed to replace a laptop or a desktop
pull the battery out now
you can do that while the unit is running
go get another battery
we've got two speakers
we've also got our docking connector here
here this area here you can see is modular
highly a fingerprint reader
a lot of people seem to accept this form of authentication more basically in
doesn't replace the need for a password
it's a really nice and generously sized
Wacom pen this pen will be fine for taking a lot of notes
Wacom pens just above that big improvement for motion on this device
here this is the unity is IP 54 rated so it is very water and dust resistant
you probably take take it into the shower with you if you wanted to
there which is pretty cool so you can see this device here
this r12 is running
but of course you can if you need to run
you've both got the ability to run
the you know the new modern applications to full screen touch applications
you also have the ability to run desktop applications here so which is really great
that's probably more than enough in terms of screen resolution
we'll have a look at how the tablet performs as a note-taking device
you can see that
we've got a few notes on the page here and I'm just going to configure the pin
we want the standard set up there so you can see that it works really really well
it's fast it's responsive
it works really really good
those are just between touch and pen really easy the great thing about the
I pull the pen away
it's it's actually
it's a really good system to use especially on a nice large screen like this
I hope that's giving you a quick overview of the motion r12
it's not necessarily in a rough environment
you can see my hands here
they don't have any calluses on them or anything like that
the old are the old f5
absolutely what's up guys
Paul here and today I'm gonna be doing a review of this tablet this is the Asus memo pad HD 7
this is my first ever tablet that
so that's kind of how that came about
this is a more budget oriented tablet
the MSRP is about $150 to that end
I also have gotten a budget oriented tablet case
I've actually been using this without a case for quite some time
I just said I wanted to get a case
I got this one from the new egg market place
it's a bit cheaper than the official
Asus one so I'll be doing a quick unbagging or whatever of this
here goes
so let's start off with the why question
why did
I buy this product well basically doing what I do
I should probably have a tablet so I decided to jump in and get this one
I've never really been all that interested in the premium tablets
the $400 + 400 to $600 plus ones like the iPads or even a $200 plus tablet for that matter
I personally see this as more as an occasional use device
it's not really a PC replacement for me
I was like oh well that seems pretty reasonable
it's a 7-inch 1280 by 800 IPS
display again pretty much the same one you're going to get on a first gen
that's a huge bonus because even with 16 gigs which is pretty decent for a tablet microUSB slot
you can add up to 64 gigs more depending on your preference powering
the device we have a 1.2 gigahertz media tech Mt for Tech's a7 ARM processor
you have a 286 mega its power
VR SGX 5-4 for mt1 and GPU
and this is a pretty decent
it's perfectly adequate
you get one gigabyte of integrated ddr3 memory and for a wireless connection to get eight or 2.11
BG and the Wi-Fi only has a single 2.4
gigahertz antenna which is
Bluetooth and GPS integrated size-wise at 7.7 inches by 4.7 inches by 0.4 inches
Asus is providing the center 480 of colors
this is the blue one which has a matte finish
it's not the greatest
but this is more of a budget tablet so it's kind of what you might expect you get a micro
USB port a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack a micro SD card slot
and then you also have volume and power buttons
I'm not ecstatic about the placement of these
that's not really what I bought it for
you also have the ability to do floating apps and widgets which
I have actually used this for so far here at home
this is primarily web browsing while sitting on the couch
so it's nice for watching videos and stuff or just play music
you can use the app to control media center or Windows Media Center
I found it very useful to do data entry while I'm running bit remarks since I have the Google
Drive app installed
well not having to use the computer than benchmarking on so it's usually
I'll talk about the build build quality and the build quality is okay again
this is a budget tablet
you're not going to find the sort of rubberized finished or the really sturdy
it's still sturdy enough
you might notice here in the corner for example some of the finishes actually rubbed off
that's part of why
I got the the carrying case for it but yeah oh okay build quality just a seven
you're not going to be blown away by it or anything
performance again is okay
I would give it a seven but I'm gonna bump it up to an eight because the screen is so nice again
it's an IPS
I will notice some slowdown and some stutters here and there
I would even really complain about if I wasn't doing
a dedicated review battery
life is something I should mention
Asus will list up to ten but I found closer to eight
I would say that it is fantastic and again that's a really big reason why I had
what put this laptop do to the price points and the performance of it so
I've asked it to do so if you're interested in a tablet this holiday season check it out
I know Kyle has one of those
he did a video of it over on awesomesauce news so check at least
I think he did
I know he got it if he didn't do a video on it
he's really missing out but remember the Nexus 7 a fantastic upgrade option for this Fiona
spend maybe 70 80 bucks more
but if you enjoyed this video don't forget to click the like button
but yeah leave me many comments
I appreciate all the words I appreciate you guys watching this video as well
we'll see you all next time
hi this is
it's also a tablet
the keyboard is detachable and the kickstand is adjustable to a number of different angles
there's no battery in the keyboard and you can see that
this model has a backlit keyboard not all models do
Acer positions the switch alpha 12 as a sort of laptop first device
which is the keyboard the front and the the kickstand itself so
I find that it's probably better to think of it as a notebook than a laptop on flat surfaces
it works great on your lap
Ikon core i3 skylake processor four gigabytes of RAM in 128 gigabytes of storage
this model is a $800
usually the keyboard comes with all models
which is the reason
it should get
six hours definitely is achievable
you're using it to do playing games or doing other things that are really
CPU intensive could take a toll overall
the design is kind of nice
you can play games on it
you can edit documents on it anything that you do on the laptop now again
I think on your lap but as a notebook it generally works pretty well
I like the keyboard which is pretty responsive
as soon as it's connected you can start typing now
I did notice at first that when you push down on the center it it sort of flexes a little bit
I don't love about it is down here
the arrow keys are also the page down page up home and volume
maybe two keys
there's six keys over here and that's something that
I found a lot of Acer laptops do the display is an IPS
screen 2165 1440 pixels
and it looks pretty great
strong magnets are detached the screen
they're really designed for Windows 10 and are downloaded from the Windows Store
so let's go ahead and fire up for instance the image editing application
and while we're doing that
I'm going to open a web browser so you can click multitasking
everything works pretty nicely
so we've got open here and it's a 2160 by 1440 pixels
12 inch display
of course use the touchpad and there is a precision touchpad below the keyboard
let's go ahead and file open image that
I've been editing
recently err and you can see
it's the picture looks pretty small
it's 680 pixels across in both of these pictures but the web browser knows that
these little icons are pretty tiny and they'd be hard to touch the
my handwriting is not great
I'm not very good at this game
I just want to show you that it can play and you can use the keyboard if you wanted to
I just happen to have this
xbox tile controllers
quality set to very high
the game is very playable
probably should've brighten my screen
so you can see it better but you can see my reflection so the camera angles are adjustable
graphics are pretty smooth
it is pretty responsive
and that's all
so that's a look at some of the things that you can do with this tablet as I mentioned at 2 pounds
I find it a little bit heavy to sort of hold for reading
is it going to be the best solution for everybody not necessarily
I mean if you are looking for something that you can use on your lap
down on top
the fabric of the cover and sort of the palm rest area is sort of this well fabric
it almost is a velvety surface
I'm not entirely sure
so that's a look at the
let's go ahead and type in my password
anything that you'd ever want to do with a Windows computer
it just happens to be a tablet that also works as a laptop and typing
this way is kind of hard there we go
I guess one other things I like to show is that it is capable of handling high resolution
video since we've got this high resolution screen
I'm going to go ahead and mute
that's actually not what I wanted to do
that's 1440 video and that
I can get that tab to come out
let's do a 1080p video at the same time
so they're you two videos one 14:40 and one at 1080p and I'm not really sure what's going on there
I guess she's cooking and doing calligraphy
this is Brad Linder with little feuding and a look at gaming web browsing web video reading ebooks
depending on the model you get this model actually comes with it and the keyboard comes standard
hello everyone in this video
i'll be reviewing this android tablet
it's by me berry
and this is the m6 model
i'm going to go through all the features
um i'm going to just go through a bit of a demo
just swiping through the tablet
go through the settings and see if it's worth purchasing this tablet
now it comes with a lot of attachments like keyboards uh mouse they give a lot of attachments
and that's the
this is the first tablet that i've reviewed that
they provide all these accessories
so you've got that nice protective case there
it also comes with a mouse here as well and which requires
i'm sure it requires batteries
i don't can't even open this
i don't have nails to open it but yeah it takes two aaa batteries to operate this
so you've got that option so you've got two options there hold on
and that's the micro usb charging cable for the keyboard
okay now as you can see here it takes a 3.5 millimeters headphone
it has the usb type-c charging port and at the same time
you can actually take this off
i've managed to open it now
it takes two sims so you take sim
one sim two
and it also takes a micro sd memory card so this literally is packed with a lot of features
it's easy to um close but closely as well but it's easy
there's a chance of actually losing that as well all the time
okay so they also give you a cleaning cloth everything so literally
this is the reason why i really like it
because of those reasons plus i love the build quality
okay let me just switch on now
i've already gone through the setup as well so bear that in mind
i've gone through that so i can just show you exactly how it looks so now you can see
this is how it looks when it's um when it's done it's very smooth
the touchscreen is very smooth easy to use as well
now you've got all these things already built into your netflix
few apps built already built into it
and there's chrome so i'm going to go to settings now on settings uh you have a few apps okay
uh the battery
life is amazing on this it has 8 000 mah mah battery capacity
around 12 gig is already used up without downloading anything
but it's just a just how smooth it is
okay um opera
the touchscreen is very smooth
playing games is very smooth
it has a very large speaker as well
the sound quality is amazing
build quality is very good
and i think i've taken a picture as well
like i've shown you and yeah so that's all the features so let me look for the galleries
where's the gallery gallery gallery
it should be somewhere here
okay let me just go to camera first all right so that's the camera
that's the best thing i've taken one picture as well so i can show you how it looks
you know
it's not the best
it's very pixelated but you know he does have a front and a rear camera
decent mega pixels to do video calls and stuff
please do give a like and subscribe

plus um this also means you have to watch your language so no cursing
this is going on youtube um anyways yeah
let's just do it okay so here
we are at the tablet review part
i tested it on stream by making a short animation in adobe animate
let's start with the tablet specifications
it has a girthy 21.5 inch panel which i found to be very nice as my usual
the resolution is 1920 by 1080 which is perfectly acceptable
the panel is a very nice looking lcd screen with etched anti-glare glass
unfortunately i have no way to test the color accuracy so all i can say is it look good
the pen is battery free and it supports 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity
your os is not supported
it goes into much more detail on the huian website something
i was a bit skeptical about but ended up
liking a lot about this tablet is that it doesn't have any shortcut keys
the pen also has a rubber grip
that is very nice to hold so much
so that it feels like it's actively fighting off any onset carpal tunnel not really
that was a joke but it is a great pen
alright now let's jump into the cons first of all
i used this with the program
what i mainly encountered with
oh my god okay
this is the only annoying thing i've found out about this pen
so far is it doesn't like to move these things right here for some reason yeah
why isn't this moving
all of a sudden this'll move
please onion skin
i got it to move before it literally
just doesn't want to huh
they're not working again
i don't understand wait
is it because my
maybe it's because my cursor was on the screen
oh my god is that it
oh that's totally a huion problem bro
but it was a small hiccup i encountered
so that's my take on the huian canvas with a k22 plus now
i'll give a list style summary
because that's the most important thing to do in any good review video
we have it works very well overall
it's easy to set up has a nice big 21.5
inch and good looking screen
and in the meh we have no shortcut buttons and a 1920x1080 resolution
would i use this tablet personally
large screen tablet
yes i definitely would
i posted the animation that i made on twitter
if you want to check it out i will put a link in the description as well as links to the tablet
maybe i'll upload it to youtube at some point i don't know it's content anyways
chuwi ipad lte tablet review
we've seen a remarkable change in the plan of chinese goods
they're no more cheap looking and plasticky
we can observe that change from the chuwi hi-pad lte pill too
the all-metal layout in grey color looks superior hiding its funding individuality
the back is easy to touch and also doesn't scratch quite easily
the rear has another design component with a little strip on the left side
the strip really extends into the side that houses the power button and volume keys
it stands out due to its darker color and increases the attractiveness of the gadget
coming to the front the chuwi hi-pad lte comes with a sizeable 10.1
inch fhd screen
while operating the pill nonetheless you can get used to the bezels
you've got a single usb type-c port using a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
there's a hybrid
double sim card slot
that has a micro sd card choice too
the base of the tablet computer is clean while on the left side you've got
the keyboard pins the keyboard case
plays the double job of shielding the 10.1
inch tablet together with raising its productivity
we had been really surprised to discover that the computer keyboard keys were nicely spaced
it's not especially heavy so it doesn't include a good deal of burden to the general package
this chewy tablet computer is promoted as an amusement device
this weapon reproduces colors fairly well and functions even under the direct sun
should you enhance the brightness to max
it's somewhat reflective however
there's a workaround for this issue
lte are 5 mp
coming out dull
the chuwi high pad lte shines we struck no real difficulties in wi-fi or bluetooth connectivity
it's possible to observe four to five hours of movies or play games on it for a couple of hours
so for most circumstances that the chuwi hi-pad lte ought to last you a whole day
it almost takes six hours for the pill to charge to 100 with the inventory charger
certainly charging the pilot to be tagged as an overnight-only encounter utilizing some other usbc
charger didn't really accelerate this procedure
there's nothing to discuss
applications because chewy made a decision to utilize a stock version of android 8.0
the chuwi ipad lte has its own set of issues
the touchscreen encounter isn't ideal
the computer keyboard case has difficulty maintaining the tablet in a vertical position
the ui experiences occasional lags
the camera is ordinary and charging the battery requires quite a while

naw this is stir you hello and welcome to a very different edition of mark
fancy stuff today
I won't actually be fixing stuff
mobile internet device
I have a little review of it for you and so that you can see whether it's worth it now
there is no ball two of these is
I actually have two daughters
now if this will do it it'll be worth its weight in
God I probably won't be much though seems to wait very very easily
I mean if there's actually anything in the box
so let's read the box and say 7-inch capacitive display with 800 x 480 pixel resolution
point for OS a one together
sorry fog you buy on-board storage which probably will be about 1.4
I acid we got 2,300 milliamp hours like a battery for up to five hours use
oh really five hours
five hours might be five hours on standby home
and that's something
i think i'll have to actually test for this video
I 10 to 11 BG in a Wi-Fi capability 0.3
don't see that happening
3 15 min out their application marketing
buzz biax access operate
I'm a little bit
I remember things like telephoned with wires
which your dad had to set up any neighborhood because he was awfully tired
let's unbox this beastie the trustee orange scissors which my wife doesn't know that
I have just one down there
things which will hopefully and i'll use to survive the trip
then here you go fill your boots young man
fill your boots right
hmm brillion party genius perrier award in making anyway
let's see what's inside this sucker so whipping off the lid bench wait
it's actually quite a robust box for the price
and you don't usually get robust stuff in robust boxes for cheap prices
so what do we have here
busby seven quick start
guide is probably very very useful
indeed description of device
we know what these things do
it's impossible to transfer files to and from the tablet
well that's sounds interesting or via the microsd card slot not supply blah blah blah
recycling doo de doo
if you kill it you've got to take it to the tip
oh my good stuff so yeah really rubbish
what we have here okay well
I'm not expecting too much goodness but then have a look
there's some kind of foam bag which is always good
and let's looky here no hang on we won't
let's have a look at the accessories first
alright so what do we have here
there's actually something in here
we'll see what milliamps this outputs actually help and to do 1000 milliamps of 1 amp
so it's actually very very standard
please a kit but nice
it is supplied or pop down there
what's this micro
we'll probably have a couple of these line around so stand
USB cable this must be the on-the-go cable it sure
bother opening the bag here but it's yep pretty much yeah USB adapter allegedly
we'll put that to one side and let us have a look
let's have elite well
first impressions got a bit of weight to it but not too much and oh here we go so it's uh hello
Here I am yes
hello um screen protector
Joby let's have a look nice
that looks pretty
good for a forty seven quid
what can you expect
well nearly 40 acre who's counting ok so the front place is pretty good
let's have a look at the back a spade
he's got a lovely green sticker on it
we have some power buttons which is always helpful and probably volume there and a back button
okay so see if its powers on
I'm just going to reconfigure the camera so it's a little bit easier for you to say okay
so here's the tablets off
you might get a reflection me and trust me
nobody wants that so busby sevens and busy busy bees
and here's the land
droid clockwork thing working away
this is probably going to take ages having a bit of trouble focusing
now it's quite dark
doo doo doo doo
oh now that was quicker than expected to be honest
let's see what we've got here
no internet connection obviously and yeah android 40
then what do we actually have camera
settings browser email play music and must be apps
where's the Play Store
does this actually have the
Play Store enabled so let's pop into apps and see what we come here
choose some apps to add nap
see on screen touch and hold it
sounds a bit rude if you ask me
mmm doing a place
to of course
play store isn't going to be set up because Google insists that everything is tied
come on come back into focus
everything exists them
Google insists that everything is tied to the Google email account so how to Google account well
I'm not going to do that on camera obviously but I will you go away you know
come back when I have charged the device back
yes ok so
I didn't actually move the camera
all the kitten kaboodle cuz
i'm going to pain in the backside
what i did do was go
move my monitor
because that's in the way of the wireless router
that was three monitors in the way my editing machine
I see it's dropped
oh well hush my mouth but like
I say you know it's it is what it is and it's 4799 delivered so I can expect so
uh let's go and look at apps
see what we've got abs wise games
it's quite responsive so you might show we go for about something that we all know and love
Angry Birds Angry Birds download that it's free installed accept & download
like you have a choice
keep shopping a bug
no idea that you're shopping download
I don't want to actually a door actually step away from the monetization process
that's all so so
that's being downloaded and installed as we can see here in a little status bar
we not going too fast here
so 1156 p.m.
I think it's cashing it to the SD card
all of the time
so maybe that's it alright
so that's downloading whilst it is downloading take an opportunity to just step back button there
you also got the back home apps list there
I don't even know who these people are
and welcome to google play music
you want to buy stuff from google will add it but will st. not now and because i can't be bothered
so what is this
it's quite a nice little interface pink
the camera is as you can imagine pretty poor ok
here's me hello
hello there's a little bit of a glare there on the screen obviously one thing
I have noticed
the quality is probably as you'd expect
let's just move away from the main camera and we'll do that
I say whoa yeah
let's see what happens if I pop the lights on here ye tun pretty much shipping this quality
so was it stopped out for now
good try to think what else we can show
that's interesting but i will say
i think that this tablet is excellent excellent value for money
I've put a little screen protector on here
that book 2 pounds of ebay all sorts of the normal things
you can do just like em
Thank You Birds is actually loaded now
i'll hit the wrong icon
those over this is a game called
Hugh bricks that's right
and she likes this one allegedly
I just hit the button to come out of it or did it crash what do you think
YouTube did it
crash noodle cake games yellow monkey
who's going to try and sell me something immediately
quick start now no idea right find it fairly difficult care so it will come out that
let's actually go to the anchor birds
that are you sure you want to exit
we want to sell you something else
so well we'll just put that back pound
just get that in the center there
okay so cramped up beside your bed from there anyway
Rovio oh yes
skip that and the instructions
ok so now everybody knows that
yeah so there
you have a budget device get to try skype on it
no reason to believe you won't look how to switch fine test
and thank
you can't be bothered to work it out
so let's just have a clip here for educational purposes only learn that film
consider yourself one of us
go see yourself one of the family
Oliver yes Beauty has up straight into the action there
I won't take up any more of your time
I hope you've enjoyed this review this is Mark for Mark fixes stuff signing off remember
subscribe to get your fix lemon
this is lisa from mobile tech review
and it's windows
the keyboard is going to be a selling point on this
we're going to look at it now so this is a windows
10 tablet with intel 11th gen cpus
u-series cpus the lower power
ones like they use in
think that x1 nano so that means it can go from 7 to 15 watts but like the x1 nano the performance
here is pretty good and pretty close to your standard u-series ultrabook cpu and speaking of that
so we're getting a fresh look here with the intel 11th gen and intel iris xe graphics
it's available with a variety of cpus from core i3 on the lowliest one
i mean given how small this screen is
i think most people will be pretty happy with it is a glossy display not crazy obnoxiously
that's more nicely configured say with a core i7 16 gigs of ram and a 512 gig
ssd is going to sit your batter back around 655 right now and that keyboard
i don't have anything against the surface type cover
stick pointer for those of you who prefer that method of input so this keyboard is rigid
it doesn't make kind of hollow funky sounds
it's quite pleasant
it's not like typing on a netbook of old or something like that
also there is optional
the thinkpad is meant to be abused a bit
that's how thing pads are
so i mean it's a tablet
if you jump up and down on it you could break it
so that's wonderful to have docking stations
hello ir camera
and the usual
think shutter privacy shutters so nobody can spy on you
yeah that so the display on this again
it's full hd plus resolution
i think that's fine for the display size
the color gamut on this is pretty good you get full srgb brightness
they claim 400
nits we actually measured significantly over
you can see those metrics on screen right now
it supports touch obviously as well as the pen and the pen input on this is wacom aes 2.0
so it's pretty good stuff you know palm rejection is reasonably good
on this you'll have some diagonal line jitter but not bad for note-taking it's delightful for art
it's probably not going to be your first pick
you could do art on it
tilt support if you go with the tilt supporting pen either way
it's 4096 pressure levels
and if you do want to get the tilt sensing lenovo precision pen
that's included with us
models is 29
so not too bad
that's pretty good
it didn't get burning hot to the touch
it didn't ever get noisy
doing things like photoshop
more demanding stuff that you might do doing a little bit of database work sql
something like that you know
42 watt hour battery which is good
that can charge it up to 80 from empty in one hour battery life on
and that's not trying
not bad the kickstand on this man
this thing has some beefy hinges it stays nice and stiff it's infinite angles
no problems no wobbling no shaking
you can even rest your hand on it some without it going drooping down
so that's definitely a go on this
and there's an eight megapixel world-facing camera not bad quality
actually you know
it gets the job done
you know maybe a little mobile skyrim might even be in your future with this
so that's not too bad battery life on this is ago
the resolution of the display might not be surface pro level
too by detachable standards
i'm lisa from mobile tech review
hello hey look
it's one of those netbook things have you ever thought to yourself hmm
well you're right well done
you can successfully predict the future good for you
would you like to see the
Box tough here
it is
it's very white could be described as plain in fact no branding or advertising here
they just want to get the product into your sweaty mitts and look a bit of Chinese writing
I've no idea what that says
hopefully not ashen is
Nydia tore something
I'm arguing with that
but you know be a bit impolite right
what's inside a tablet
PC would you believe it
let's put that to one side for the second
see what else is in
not a lot is the answer
we have power adapter
CDR containing drivers could prove very useful
yes let's move that to one side and look at the device shall we immediate thing
Android laptop yep yep
let's start that again
it's far better built than the Android tablets
I've been looking at much much nicer
in fact it's got these sort of hard metal
II feeling plastic on the back but everything is a lot more solid
and there's no give anywhere around the whole thing a lot of the
Android tablets have looked tattooed
mmm disappointing the rest of its so well made anyway have a quick look at it
this is what we call a screen
it is a capacitive touchscreen
we shall get back to that
look camera has built-in microphone
there is a power light
oh look at that a SIM slot for putting in SIM cards
so you know you can connect via 3G and all that the deep built-in 3G modem
there is the microphone which begs the question
what is that light sensor or something presumably power button also sleep
oh yes this is what we like micro SD slot and yes
it's it's properly flush
Oh just result on that off the camera I do apologize
let's try that again there
we are are
you really glad you waited for that on you next up
we have another button from app x windows which is a bit disappointing is the same as that
also rotation lock although I've never got it to rotation lock from what I can remember
we have power adapter
that's not actually active there
nothing on the other side except some screws
nothing on the back except some
Silver's right let's turn it on and have a play ok
7 to take ages to start on a tablet
but it didn't take that long actually in fact it was about the same as the Android tablets
Windows 7 has a built-in touchscreen II into Phase II thing
a little dot appears a little effect to show you where you tapped
ah well that's fairly easy
click hold down for a second blip little circle appears and there comes your context menu
no surprises there really but you scream at me in the street scaring my dog
what do you do if you want to input some text
here it goes
let's type something in
need your daily dose of cute now of course
I don't don't be ridiculous as a web browser right
what you do is tap on the box you want to enter text into and nothing happens
you're typing in
let's move that monitor
shot marvelous there
we are potato has worked as I say you know I was comfortingly now now it does it
it's like an awkward child brother
go on as I say it's kind of obscuring
the view however as with windows and all such things
you have a massive choice of third party keyboards you can install
yeah my previous experiences of the handwriting
recognition being if your hand rang is no identical to the person who programmed it
you is stuffed kind of a king harp actually
Apple Newton there
think about that
if you're old enough right it's say
I wanted to do a search for something important like me
I'm super important
why actually walk
good writing from this angle
will it get it yay there
we are easy web side not search for that anymore instead
I'm going to search for something
rude and childish
Oh given half the chance I always do BAM there
we are fantastic
you can use it to search for rude things into everything but no handwriting recognition
very very
good if you're on the fly like I find it much better than the crappy standard keyboard
not there's anything technically wrong the sound keyboard except it obscures
what you're typing into
it's a bit of a problem really so as I say download one of the others
you'll have more fun
okay that's a bit touchscreen e so now
I suppose we can have to look at specifications
well the screen itself is capacitive
obviously and is very very nice
it's a very precise feels solid
it doesn't ever miss your taps or anything
what else we got right screen size 1366 across 768 down
that's in pixels
not 2 nautical miles
it's got an atom in 4 five process
rubble actually being windows
why don't we check manage please
Bob boom trust me
the people and the dialogues it takes longer to calchas it scans
Hardware here we go device manager Knoll a performance device manager
oh sorry folks is not easy through a viewfinder right we can now probably expand processes
Inc there we are yes indeed
it is an atom in four five five
CPU at one point
transfer speeds like on the expensive desktop
SSDs you can buy and plug into your main PC
this is far more on the speeds of a sort of USB interface e type thing
that's about all there is to say
Intel graphics media accelerator 3150
one word to that boo
I suppose perhaps they eat too much battery or cost too
much money's or whatever so how does this actually play back video
well pretty well is the answer to that it's well
I mean everybody if you want to watch a video these days it nearly always h.264 isn't it
I happen to have here
think an h.264 video file in 1280 by 720 or 720p as you may know it
it's an intra actually that
I mean open with no dragon to that thank you as if I'd want media player to play it
oh sorry shouldn't sing along as you can see
it plays nicely but can it play it
fullscreen mean come back
the answer is yes
just don't show you the end bit
look it looks like an old
Commodore Amiga computer crashing anti clever let me know and piss off
that's a bit of a problem
I can get it to play em cavies up to about a DVD resolution
where's that sort of 720
576 and it seems to play
fine since you get to 720p territory it begins to choke on it
unless of course you've got everything in a non MKV format then
it seems to be fine and lovely and everything works like it should okay
what comes after specifications battery life
I suppose the answer that is about three hours really is as simple as that
it still seems to last about three hours
that seems a bit odd
Ben failed to tell spider-man right next up webcam yes there's a built-in webcam
shall we have a look through it
go on then
we've press connect on this program about going out and Bing oh look it's me
I really hate this webcam because it makes my head look all weak and distorted
look my head
isn't that round in real life
almost that's a little bit weird isn't it really
I'm giving away my setup
now look camcorder filtered to talk into so you don't hear this all the time actually
I want if I can go
pop enough and hiss enough to make it go through the filter probably
I won't find out till playback
what a pointless experiment anyway here
I'm going to mention a program a specific program
do you remember
there's this really cool tablet
this is what happens when you've got a keyboard
delete get rid of that
let's go through all programs
oh yes
I'm gonna set that up
don't worry about that
we ensure them that today mate here we go it basically looks like a bit of paper
something else is interesting
look it's like a special effect entron or something
I don't know if this is
I can't imagine this is a problem with the tablets as you know
it's fairly nippy as these things
get on with it nearly there
I'll know it all ran a bit art
there we go it does actually select everything
we are not something to do very often
good buying sane right
well i suppose now we have to do the infamous thing of throwing this on its side going
that's a really fair comparison
but it's gotta be done
they keep for that express purpose
oh yeah right well
the iPad is physically
it's like smaller screen slightly smaller
I suppose and why are we talkin
technical things avoiding the obvious elephant in the room
it's all about how you use it
on the operating system windows
this is an absolute breeze
it doesn't destroy all the data already on your iPad
so yeah that's sort of good in that respect
what is not so good
is that a very little tablet specific software
in fact that's why
is that going to improve massively
Apple themselves have a new iPad coming out this year like I don't know
so what do you want
what do you want to do with it
it's so difficult
oh wait we haven't gotten to price yet have we
well here's the thing
or about 290 pounds
to be honest
mind you 3 hours battery life 10 hours battery life
what do you need it for
this comes down to that dreaded pathetic ending again
where if you've watched this video and thought man
I could really do one of those
I wouldn't recommend getting one really
I mean you know do important work on the train
so that's been very very good for me
Thema just saw
the room was very nice
yes she said my god where do I get one how do I get one
I need one now
the shops out of stock coming up one of eBay
well mama but which really surprised me
and because well he had a really weird use for he's got it set up right
I imagine this is his desk with his PC
you know and his keyboard and all that stuff going on here
he's got it set up to the left of his desk on a music
stand just sitting there like that
somebody skypes him or down
we're going to mention the other programmer uses for video chat
I can't remember the name of it
oh well it's like Skype but isn't if somebody comes through on this
he just sort of presses the answer button and a way
he talks without interrupting what he's doing on the main machine at all and also does the fact
this doesn't draw much juice
he has it plugged into the mains all the time and I believe he runs it
it just occurred to me actually must have already plugs an external hard drive into it
would he mmm
I'll ask him about that
anyway that's completely irrelevant
yeah it's a really powerful and flexible tool but it's a bit rough around the edges
a bit like a screwdriver with a spikey handle you
hi this is
Karen Pocket all calm today
I'm going to review this tablet that we own has sent over for this review
this is the new one zero six zero plus graphics tablet
I have actually reviewed the earlier model that I bought from a friend
that is the old one zero six zero plus so this is the new model
let's open this up and see what's inside
this is a very slim box
let's turn it over and see what we have
some general information these are specification
they're supposed to be an 8 gig memory somewhere
I don't know whether or not that is on but the tablet all comes in a separate USB
Drive I'm going to find it out later anyway
the working area is ten
means the accuracy of where your stylist position is and this report rate is 233
let's open this up
they have a
Koosh in just behind a front cover to protect tablet
so this is the tablet
there's this a claw here
I think is to put the pen
I'm gonna try to out later
so this tablet has let's see 12 shortcut buttons and 16 soft express key buttons here
it has a very smooth surface
this is let's see live or the graphics tablet so it comes with a free glue
put this back here and this to you back here
okay this is a new design
oh it actually comes with a pen cap now so older models they do not have two pen cap
this is quite good so actually
it's the pen design
it is actually a similar to the earlier pens but it comes with the pen
cap comes with two buttons as well
holder comes with replaceable
nibs as well and this is their this is the nib remover
this piece of metal here so I shall put this here like this
put this here like this it
close it like this
the new design of the cable is much better
I wasn't able to do that so be careful not to lose the cap so now
I'm going to demonstrate the performance on some selected software
this checkbox here allows you to indicate whether or not you are using a tablet
PC but I am NOT very sure what it's supposed to do
then there's the screen setting let's see what is this
there's no option here
is the pen pressure test
where opens up and external dialog box where you can test your pen pressure
ok if you are left-handed user
you can check this box here
what went wrong with my tablet driver and it turns out he was the wind tech driver so now that
I'm using ooh yawns version
it is fine
let me show you the keyboard shortcuts that I have assigned to the physical patterns
I have assigned this to control end which is a which is to create a new foul so once
I press it immediately
the dialog box comes up so I can do this all right
I'm going to pick a brush
let me zoom in for you
now the lines
they do not paper as well compared to
they are much smoother
this is an example
probably that is closer to a
see some examples here however you can actually use a plugin that is called lazy
Nezumi Pro if you want to have even smoother strokes smoother papers for example
Wacom tablets the way their strokes taper
so this is much more gradual compared to we our strokes which have this thin line right at the end
this is the only issue that I face with Photoshop
other software they do not have
there's a problem
I do not know why now when it comes to latency lag
they have their brush to that
also can use pen pressure so
I'm going to create a new file and pick a brush here and see whether or not I can create
oops where's my brush
let me change the settings first so right here
this is a very nice software
this seems like mischief has no problems at all
he can detect pen pressure as well and the strokes they are very smooth
let me try some quick hatching
MUX the strokes they taper very well in is cheap too
close this and move on to MIDI Bank paint Pro MIDI Bank paint
Pro is a free drawing application
which has a lot of features dedicated to drawing manga
I really like this software
it's very good and main attraction is it has so much features and it's free so it's already hired
how do you recommend this this is mischeif
I mean sorry this is mini Bank paint crew again
Pro let me show you the strokes the taper quite nicely as well very very nice
no problems with painters
I next is critter
this is version 3.0 point one point one so let me see
this is a pasady brush
this transition is very nice
and it's the post pen traveler - you know like whatsoever close this this is
Wacom Bamboo paper
this is actually an app developed for tablets so you can support
we don't have this as well and it works quite well you can
if you happen to be using sketchbook well
this tablet looks fine on sketchbook
too so with sketchbook again and pressure works very well
the transition is very smooth
I think there are some problem with the tapering effect again
this is well alright
I think they have a very good product here
I've also shown you a workaround which involves installing the plugin called lazy crow lazy Nezumi
it's a really good plugin with all the other software
there's no problem we just have that
that's all for my review today
if you have any questions feel free to post them in the comment section below
I will also post a link to the text review for this tablet in case there are any updates
thanks for watching
see you in the next video bye
Sometimes it's a gamble when it comes to budget technology.
But today I'm going to take a detailed look at the DragonTouch Max
which is expandable and a 10.1 inch IPS
screen for great viewing at many angles.
It runs on Android 9 Pie which is still running on a lot
Android phones...
or at least until everyone is updated.
The touch screen is pretty smooth and responsive.
However it's not as smooth as what I'd see like on an iPad for example.
The DragonTouch Max
10 works in portrait and landscape orientation making it ideal for reading or watching video.
At the top of the screen
there's a front mounted camera which is great for video chat.
And on the back
there's also another camera with a flash next to it.
And in case you're curious, here are the highest resolutions
the cameras can handle.
For photos the back camera is 8 megapixels and the front camera is 5 megapixels.
For video recording, the back camera records 720P HD and the front camera is 480P SD resolution.
And on the bottom of the tablet there are dual stereo speakers.
Buttons are pretty minimal on the Max 10 and as you can see
there are only power and volume buttons.
Next to those is the memory card slot.
And even though you can see there are 2 indicators for dual SIM cards
it won't run on cellular networks.
To add more storage, the DragonTouch Max
And the only accessories this comes with is a USB-C cable, wall charger and instruction manual.
And that's mainly because the headphone cord works as the antenna for the radio.
You can also use offline maps thanks to the built-in GPS.
For video recording, the headphone jack
also doubles as a microphone input!
But there are a few of things you'll need first.
One is the free Open Camera app from the Play Store.
This is because the official Max
10 camera app doesn't accept external microphones.
Next you'll need a TRRS adapter like this one from StarTech.
it looks like a standard
Y-splitter but It's wired differently internally.
To get the mic set up, touch and hold the Open Camera icon.
Then tap on Settings.
Now go into the Video Settings and tap on Audio Source.
Here select External Mic.
And now the Max
10 is set up to record video using audio from an external mic plugged into the headphone jack.
I think that the DragonTouch Max
10 is a great value for all the features it comes with.
The 10-inch IPS screen really makes web surfing and watching video really easy on the eyes.
so hello ladies gentlemen and viewers
today i received a graphic double summer company
enjoy this video
and let's get into it if you start in the beginning of the video
the package contained a lot of stuff
but don't worry you will be only needing a few of these first
black put into my hands was standard
i didn't know how to set it then
after a few minutes it was easy to set it up
i attach the tablet into the laptop
you don't need to also use a power adapter only hdmi and usb cable
they downloaded the installer
this may seem very very hard but believe me
it's pretty easy
my first impressions were that the screen is huge and the colors were very very warm and accurate
the screen itself is 15.3
inches widescreen full hd screen and have 16.7 million colors
the screen is also suitable for artists
who have long term exposure to digital drawing
the graphic tablet on the left side have 11 shortcut keys
it is tender so you can change the pin with any other pins that you have also inside the standard
when i started to draw on the screen
it felt almost like a paper
the bed pressure has 8192 levels
which i think is pretty high for a low class
graphic tablet the specs of this tablet are pretty good compared to other graphic tablets
that cost usually more than 400
i personally don't use the standard this
i'm used to draw or paint on paper
sometimes i take stubble into my head and draw like that
the graphic tablet is very light
it weighs only 1.3 kilos which is almost 3 pounds for the first days of using this album
i had a few backs and witches some backstabbing such as my laptop was shutting down
stay like two hours or they did shut it down
it depends from your left or how good it is
a laptop is msi and belongs to expensive products and also have a very good hardware
i think that if your laptop belongs to those cheaper products you need to love it
the only back the top will have that
if you are using the round button you will get a backline so do not use it while you are trying
i don't really mind it because you can just press the back button
and then it's fine other than that
identify any serious issue with this product
i've been using like a two weeks daily now
i would like to talk about the durability
also the depth fell down on the ground like three times
and i'm still surprised you still live and also one time
a lot of the wooden frames on the wall fell down at the tablet
and maybe that's what made it scratch
i don't exactly know so
hey how's it going
it's been a little while
said i was going to review this reversible laptop tablet
it comes with a pen and then we're about to just review it okay
that's how we go
we're gonna do it you ready
it's rugged bro's review
let's review this beautiful
lightweight pc here comes look
they packaged it real well
it's nice and compact and secure in there
open it up
it's wrapped up real nice over here
it's got a nice little wrapping
i'm gonna go ahead and pull it out of there right pull it out and look it's clean shiny
look how shiny that is
that's so pretty
well what is that little dust a little dust from the bag there
wipe that off all right
there's the uh charger and hdmi
i believe you can put an hdmi in there
so that's cool
and then they got a couple
uh usbc's over here in the top right corner bang bang and then look
it's like i said it was reversible
i'm about to flip it
that thing's cool captain spectra nice and clean
it's got six core 9th gen intel
i7 um got the geforce gtx
that's right so i do all my editing
all my 3d modeling to draw it
it's a little
it's a little harder than i thought it would be
but i'm getting it working on a cartoon so like and subscribe for when that comes out
you'll get a notification if you ring the bell but it does everything you're gonna need it to do
the only thing they really lied about is the battery life
whatever kind of program it is
it's it starts hustling
you'll hear it
it gets hot
but that's okay
i suggest you get that
because it's a it's a mean machine man
they don't really make cases for them but in the next video i'll show you what i put on mine
thanks for watching this
but it's sweet
and it's real nice
that fingerprint sensor camera microphone
everything works really well
obs works on it
you know i'm streaming
so you can stream and edit at the same time screen capture and you can do everything on this
you want to live stream some editing
i could probably do that
i feel like this bad dog can handle it like and subscribe
i'll see you next time on rugged rose review thanks for subscribing
and i'll see you next time in the next video when i talk about you know what i put on
it wrapped it in money and then there will be another video after that
stay tuned thanks
how's it going guys so
I've had I would say in my opinion enough time to have a good feel of what this tablets about
it's got four point two
Andrew four points to out-of-the-box and yeah the screen resolution is 480 by 800
so it's it's really not bad
I mean I don't know if it's just me I was expecting
I was almost kind of impressed
you know but the my main problem is is a side viewing angles for for this
it's it's just terrible
it's kind of hard to see as you are kind of tilt it a but then um speakers back here
I wouldn't I can't say too much
don't expect too much either because I played subway surfers I played my boy
it's an emulators
emulators are like you can play
like gameboy games or intend
I guess that's Android
it lags not always but for a low-end for like a pretty cheap tablet like this
it's not bad to be honest with the
I feel like I'm forgetting something here
maybe not but yeah
I mean not too much
I really can't say much more about this
except it's decent you know if you're looking for a 60 hour tablet this is uh
I would recommend one of these alright
I hope you liked this video
thanks for watching
hey everyone I wanted to try something a little different with this video
a lot of people often ask me
about what tablet is like the best to use when doing digital art and to be honest
I'll be covering these two first off
we have the gamma s 56k
the ultra thin flexible graphic tablet marked at 30 369 USD on Amazon
it's marketed as a stylus pad for the rhythm game
this tablet has 4000
LPI lines per inch and it's basically a measure of the tablets resolution meaning
you can fit 4000 digital lines
into one
inch of the tablet's active area the higher the number the better but to be honest
you probably won't notice anything over 2,000
in a given second the active area of the tablet is six by five inches and now for the unboxing
I was a fool and recorded this while watching something on Netflix on the side
so you don't get to hear the actual unboxing sounds sorry
so this is the tablet pretty small but perfect for portability
here's the QuickStart guide and the driver CD though
we don't really need that
you can download it on their website here
stylus was also like this and personally
most styluses
i've seen don't have this but you can actually turn it on and off with the button on top
kind of like a normal retractable pen
and lastly you got your spare pen nibs for when they wear out although the tablet is flexible
I don't recommend trying to fold it all the way
I haven't stress tested it but I feel like that might damage it so now
I am actually drawing as you can see
I'll be using Adobe Flash because that's normally what I hand made on
I did try this on paint tool Sai and it works fine there but for this example
I'll just be drawing in flash because you know that's what that's what I'm comfortable with
we're off the bat
the tablet feels definitely different from what
I can confirm that it actually works pretty well
I can say that it does work well or as well as what I need it for
it's pretty responsive you know and it actually doesn't jitter that much or at all actually what
I've tried in the past
it might start chittering randomly
you could adjust that this is selecting your monitor
I currently have three so obviously
it's like the one that you're working on and pressure test
you'll notice that it's kind of more rectangular in here
I'll draw another one probably a little bigger
I'm just following the grid and it's a rectangle but I drew a square on the tablet
so now you could
this is in the full area
this would be your whole tablet and by matching the screen ratio
it'll actually look more like a square here
I'll draw another one little bigger again
so things aren't weird because it before doing that
I'd like to do to test tablets is I guess
basically draw the thing
that's many mistakes is basically how
which is why we have the convenient smooth tool
I'd say this tablet is pretty good for sketching on programs
but if you are gonna do more detailed art
this is actually very good especially for the for the price this is what I notice
I do a lot of undos if my undo rates have increased drastically
I've got to draw the rest of my hair
yeah there's something you don't see normally
Dominic's in color
wow what a treat would probably double my work time but for the sake of his demonstration
increase increase my speed but right now
I'm a little bit rusty
um this kind of tablet but it works you know
it's cheap and it's great
I like it you
all a brand new released
thank you matrix bad as 8 which is really a fantastic tablet running
Android OS with eight inch IPS screen now
all the typical feature would let you decide that
is this tablet for you or not are mentioned on the back of the packaging starting with the 8 inch
now in my video
I tend to go extra mile showing each and everything to a typical user
we're gonna go with the unboxing to see what comes with this matrix pad
s8 package include one leaflet from manufacturer
come with eight inch
IPS technology screen with 1280 by 800 screen resolution
only a typical tablet that can meet the basic video and Internet needs
we're in the front
we have a four point two megapixel camera and five megapixel on the back now
SIM card option as well as the earphone out
where as buttons to control her available top left hand side starting with the volume control
rocker switch power on and off button and a microphone slot
you can't really fault much around it everything every
Buzzle is fantastically done like a premium in quality
I have to admit that screen is fantastic
Android 9.0 with the RAM of 2 gigabytes
and on top of it
you can also wirelessly
not that bad at all you can also manage your storage easily to any now in terms of system wise
it's got about 5.4
Giga bytes of system storage
actually that's quite a lot to be honest with you
obviously the new systems are taking little bit long
you know quite a lot of memory
now in terms of battery
life tablet is installed with the 2,400 million pair
our battery are using this all settings
you got to get the better response out of your battery life now
you can see that works great on the touch screen as well
let's search it
you can search me if you wanted to start with by just writing my name in there you know so
fold all the typical products
let me zoom the camera in a bed to give you more idea the performance of running
YouTube application on the tablet is fantastic
now another typical use of this kind of a tablet is the web surfing
you can use your Google Chrome or any web browser you have in here
just keep adding the tab in there so
it's not a edited version or anything like that
you just keep adding it
not bad actually
not mixing up with anything
perfect is pretty fast as well
I'm on let's suppose let's go on to the Amazon website and you can go on
today's deals go
I only notice by using this application called FM radio
when you open it up you just need to plug in your earphones and off it
go straight away work without any problem
we have all the typical applications which are pre-installed
on this tablet
starting with the calculator calendar
your cameras are also available in a year front as well as the back
you can use them too now
here is your front camera on it now
it's pretty alright
actually start that bad
you can take a picture if you want to with that now to check out the front camera
click on to this menu button and press this here
well you can see me right in there
aren't you well
the response of a screen is pretty decent
actually while playing again him with the
it's not bad actually
oh now there's another important test which we should not forget to try
it's basically a shifting between landscape and portrait
we are in a landscape mode
let's go into portrait now
yo not bad actually not that bad and you work great now
another main purpose of me
purchasing this tablet was to play my plex media from an ass drive and so far so good
actually it worked great on it non-medication on my plex server work
great it updates everything very quickly
I can play any video from a black server right on this tablet
let's play this movie right in here
look at that no problem in terms of the navigation as well now
I liked the most about this tablet as well now
I have shown you everything which I think very important to make a call
that is that tablet
good enough for you or not
I suppose I have cleared everything if you think I have missed anything
please do let me know in the comment section down below as well
that is that tablet worth buying or not
let's start with the
Android operating system is using the latest one
can it play the games yes it can
can it play the videos on
YouTube Full HD ones
yes it can can you use it on the
Plex for the external media player
yes you can
what else you want navigation works very good off your web serving
this tablet is worth buying from my side
that would be all from my side guys
hi this is
Brad Linder with little beauty and this is the cube
I six Air 3G
it's nine point
it's a pretty nice comfortable
iPad size tablet
now as you can see it's running
Google Android 4.4 KitKat software here
but what makes this special is that it's also a dual OS template it also has Windows 8.1
and you can switch between operating systems just by hitting that little
OS switch button which I will show you in a few minutes first
let's take a quick look at what you can do in
I've installed a number of different apps
we've got the Marvel unlimited app here which we can use to read comic books and the display
it's a high resolution screen
looks pretty good for reading things
it's probably some sort of anti-glare coating although as you can see
there's still plenty of glare
but it is a
it's very responsive
it's pretty fast
it it scores about what
I would expect in benchmarks for for a tablet running Android with an Intel Atom processor
now one of the nice things about having a tablet that can run both Android and Windows
so let's go ahead and reboot now the first month or so that
I had this tablet I found myself not really using it much in Windows
Windows I just don't like the the tablet experience as much to be perfectly honest
I don't happen to have a bluetooth mouse but I do
have this wireless mouse that
I'm gonna go ahead
and plug into the single micro
we've got this the windows experience here which is designed for touch screens in terms of the the
we can treat it like a general desktop or laptop style computer
so let's go ahead and open up
Google Chrome now you can use web browsers and Android but when you use them in Windows
it's a little bit different in that in that it's easier for me to make typos now in that
now we have access to running it in a small moveable window
we can run it in full screen again the Wi-Fi is faster and other rooms in my house than it is here
but this is where we're shooting the video
what's going to happen
is the tablet will
it's going to open up the video here
probably shouldn't skip around but okay there
we go exhibit viewing angles are pretty good
I was good and see
we can brighten the screen a little bit viewing angles are pretty good
it's a IPS display
so it should look good from different angles
actually it's faster than I would expect for a Windows computer with an Intel Atom processor
you can find more details in our full review at li'l appearing calm but what
it actually finishes it more quickly than any other
Intel Atom based system that I fried
now this is an image
that's 680 by 425 pixels
I'm going to open that same image in the blog post
so here's that same picture same number of pixels but the Chrome web browser says
oh this is a really high-resolution screen windows tells me
is the picture smaller here
but these little file save you know delete etc
buttons are really really tiny
same thing happens with the image editing program
I had two applications running side by side
it's kind of you
don't get a lot of room side by side when you do things like that
there is the option to do that in
there's and again it's go ahead and open that same picture and you'll see how small it is
now we can zoom in on the picture make it does a 400% or 200%
but all of these little toolbar
menus are really really tiny which can be difficult to use
unless you're holding the tablet right here or up to your nose
and this is treating that the 2048 by 1536 pixel display like a big screen 2048 by 1536
but it make it kind of difficult to see what's happening
that's that's not so bad but for the most part in order to keep things comfortable
I've kept it at the largest setting so that's one thing to keep in mind when you're using
don't really care what your
I mean I'm sorry it only has 4 gigabytes of free space out of that 32
now there is a micro
and that's about it
there's a front-facing camera a rear camera
yeah it sounds ok
it's not super loud but it's not it doesn't have a lot of base but it works ok for basic usage
so that's a quick look at and sort of what you can do
you can have to wait a minute
or two for it to reboot and switch operating systems in order and then switching back
you have to do the same thing you have to wait again
it's decent performance
so that's why
I'm mentioning them by name
another weird thing
that's a little bit quirky
is that when you reboot it messes with the clock for some reason
it's 2 o'clock or a 2 20 but it thinks that it's it's 720
I can go in
I can reset the clock in Windows but when I reboot to Android and back to Windows
it'll be off by about 4 hour or five hours again
I'm not really sure why it does that but it does that
I'm not sure
3G is an interesting option and I forgot to mention this earlier
it's about 6 to 7 hours of battery life
I 6 err 3G dual boot dual OS Android and Windows tablet and the last thing
I'll show you is the inside
q qs' software here which there's a configuration utility in
there's a little button on the bottom says dual OS switcher
there's no way to go back once you hit it so
I'm going to hit it
it'll start to reboot
I'll just turn off the camera
you're about to be signed out closed and it's rebooting you
what's up guys
chicks there from chicks tech reviews today
I've got my hands
and lots more
so this is the latest vo i8
Mac's Android tablet so
Wow pretty impressed with the design so far
this is the latest model
it's the max model
I believe you can get the i8
Pro and the i8
Plus this is the latest max version which will give you a 10 core CPU which is a Decker core
I'll put the specs on the screen
so you guys can have a quick read
you also have four gigs of RAM 64 gigs of internal storage
this has built-in dual band
Wi-Fi AC Bluetooth version for GPS and Android version 7.1
so the tablet itself is made mostly from plastic however the actual kickstand is made from metal
now the tablet weighs only 580 grams
and it's only 9 millimeters thin
the build quality feels very solid great design
I loved 180 degree kickstand
you have a very nice screen
you also have dual
4G SIM card slot
so it's quite useful that this tablet has dual band
it's made of metal
now it's time to check out the results for all the various tests including Wi-Fi and benchmarks
so here is my top performing
Android tablet chart for 2018
showing you all the latest
max has taken position 5 on this chart
Valle I ate
I threw out with ease
games and movies looked absolutely amazing
I was not expecting much from this
that's all for this video don't forget to
Like and subscribe thank you so much for watching and I hope you all have a brilliant day
see you the next one guys
hello guys welcome to a new video today
I'm gonna be doing a review of the Galman s 56k drawing tablet
so thank you to
Gamal for sending me another one so the Galman s 56k is a flexible drawing tablet
which is really interesting
it's not rechargeable like a lot of other tablet pens tend to be and it's not standalone liked
Wacom pens you will need to put a battery in it
it has a button at the end where you turn it on and off
this tablet was very easy
I didn't have any hiccups
I didn't have any problems installing it
Sai the lines were much smoother and the pressure sensitivity
worked as it should
there were some initially wobbly lines
I have the smallest desk I could find in Ikea
so you're probably used to that anyway
I've included footage from the screen recording and from my webcam
so you can see how
I work with this tablet if it helps you at all
the working area is 120 by 160 millimeters
sorry is very compact
but it didn't take me too long to get used to using that size tablet again like
I said I prefer the feeling of using a standard tablet that isn't flexible
I just used the shortcuts on my laptop
I have on my other tablets
that's just how
so that's really handy
the pen itself doesn't feel particularly expensive
it kind of feels a bit plasticky
this isn't a bad thing
it's just something that
it has a 10 millimeter reading height
D&D characters I'm gonna be playing her in a one-shot next months
I haven't played her yet
her name is Brandon L willow shield
she goes by brandy and she's half elf half hill dwarf
she's short and has a little bit of a 5 o'clock shadow on occasions
she's a ranger
I just thought you know what I'm gonna make this character seasick so just have fun with it
she doesn't really know what she's got herself in for
so that's gonna be fun so yeah overall
I'm very impressed with this tablet
this one had no issues with the active area
there was no skipping
there wasn't really any lag
I only had the occasional problem with pressure sensitivity which was quickly resolved
I'm not 100% sold on the whole a flexible tablet thing
I'm just not used to the texture of the tablet and the way that the surface feels to draw on
but it's not a bad thing
and now it's 20 $6.99
so yeah if you're just getting into digital ah and you're not sure what to go for
I would definitely put this forward so thank you gal mom for sending me another one
I really hope you guys found this video useful
please do ask me if you have any questions and as always thank you so much for watching
I hope to see you next time bye
everybody adhere with the digital digest and today
it also has a USB host port a traditional one unlike the Arco 70 which was lacking that
I want to point out this
viewing angles on
this screen are slightly inferior to that of the 70
I'm not sure exactly why I don't think it has to do with pixel density
I think it's more a matter of that
they're simply maybe getting the panels from different sources
did read some stuff online pertaining to this panel being the same one used in the viewsonic
G tablet and if that is the case then that might be why
we're seeing some of the poor viewing angles but I don't want it anyway
let's just leave it at that
moving away from the screen again
256 Meg's of RAM just like the 70 the same arm a cortex 1 gigahertz clock processor a good chip
it's got the same front-facing camera same
now let's get into the actual product itself as you can see
I've gotten gadget up here
let me show you loading up another page again
no flash support here
so don't be shocked by that let's say
I put a little new source here not that CNN is my favorite but you know a popular one
I guess for some loads up pretty quickly again
I'm just really impressed
the 70 is meant to go mobile
the ten is really meant to be at home and again
let me take you guys back to the home screen again
pretty much will just bring up
I'm pretty impressed again
I'm not running anything on here yet to control task management
I want to show you guys show you how to go for a second
just as an e-reader again you're gonna want to use this in portrait not landscape which
it's pretty good
so let's take a look at that again
we've got a little bit larger layout of ports here
you've got power down there at the bottom right
let's say on your bed or couch
so that's pretty cool
close up that kickstand
it is a pretty tight
kickstand know that in advance the accelerometer g-sensor seems to be working pretty well and yeah
I'm overly impressed so far
there's your microphone by the way
don't let me forget that for your recordings at video
chat and overall really impressed guys
hope you enjoyed the initial impressions here of the device
where you get really more than what you pay for
you're getting a complete experience which
recommend you'll see further impressions from me soon
I hope you guys enjoyed the video

hello guys came here and I wanted to talk about the tablet
I got from
hye-young we all hire you know
they offered me a sponsorship so hell yeah
I didn't even know there
I thought it will be bigger
but that's good
it's smaller than my previous one
it's for the screen tablet
I really like it because the previous one didn't sit well on my hand and don't look at this
this is what acetone does with a tablet pen
I just wanted to keep my nails
yeah the instructions there are million which is even pollution
that's good for me because as you can see
I mean as you can hear my English is crap
you have the ends the points
I don't know how to say that
but the thing is that you click with the pen you know you have to change them and the pointers
the welcome one was kind of short and that bothered me a little but yeah it was
I could use it anyway but that was better overall
the tablet is really good and I highly recommend it
I tested it and about that speed point
but more about the tablet it does really smooth lines so the line art is just like
it's way better
it has more pen pressure points
I think that's called like that
you'll have them there then
Jack very proud of this drawing because we didn't take it along but I think it's cool
I like how I did the background

well you guys for a little bit and thank you for watching my video
ok thank you very much
have a good day
what's up guys
welcome back to another review
how is everyone doing today so today
we are reviewing you
this tablet wasn't sent to me
I bought it out of my own pocket so starting off in the box which I've already unboxed you
get the tablet itself
I do become the ug m7o
it comes with a ten by six active drawing area
it's a very nice and large active area
the largest active area means
usually the bigger is always better
you can pick this up for around 60 euros on Amazon
it provides eight nice
if you're left-handed she's like so so all the keys can be under
I the keys can be configured on the eg software that you installed from the installation disk
it's very useful for porn the undo and redo buttons and change in the brush sizes
it doesn't really bother me that much because when I'm drawing I'm looking at the screen
instead of looking at the tablet itself the tablet does have a nice slick design to it
it's also very very light compared to some other tablets one advantage though is the
Wacom tablets have over the Fuji tablet is their Wireless
this isn't a wireless one as you can see
you need to stick a used right here you speak
Abel goes right in there
Amazon as well
so there is a wireless bundle but yeah it needs to be connected at all times
the tablet features a nice
feel to it
it gets very dirty but it's fine
it's fine there's no use to weigh
it's just just a nice design
I guess that's it
and the rest of the board just has a kind of a graphite finish to it on the back
was that happen in like the first week as you can see
it's very very delicate but I can
I just use just a piece of blossom kind of plastic here
I haven't even bought a purple screen protector and it still works
fine as you can see the things that shine and now you mind
prefer the feel of it but it doesn't really bother me that much
some of these do require batteries but the version
I need a charger and actually the charge lasts lasts a very very long time one thing
I don't like is the two bottoms right here
so you can pretty much
this is usually my enter button and this could be my eraser button
I really would prefer if there was just no buttons at all
that's just me
I prefer how I'll just prefer
how old just traditional pencils feel to be honest
it does come with a pen holder
we've eight nibs
and then we have the neighbor mover just in the middle right there if I can get that
uh there's not in there and here's the nib remover
which pretty much if you want to take the nib out
it's very easy
you get your pen
here's the nib
whose range is gonna put it in with my hand just like that press on it and boom it's Luntz back in
it's very easy and you just return that so the nibs will last
but that's just really up to whatever you do so a lot of people
ask me actually how
I'm not pressing as you can see right now
I'm hovering
I actually see a lot and a lot of people
just keep asking that in different tablet review comments and stuff like that
I have here and I made a mistake
he sells hot cells
I don't really use this
don't know what it's for
I'm actually not sure what this is for side
I just don't use a my tablet works fine without that
I would definitely recommend you
this these are the buttons on pen
there's the barrel button one button one
that's the top button and you can just go into mouse commands
there's different mouse commands right there
then there's the double click time and the coordinates just gonna click apply real quickly there
but it's simple after you get you you get it figured out so you can pretty much use any monitor
you want and you can just drag like that so you want to
I'm gonna work on Marshall one for now so I have went to all these sections now
the only section left is supports digital ink
it works if you click supports digital ink
it does not work if you don't have a clicked on for me anyways
I'm not sure what you guys have so here
I'm an Autodesk and I'm just gonna draw a few strokes right here as you can see you can see
the lines are very nice and curvy
just like that something like that
now there is a bit of jitter so when you're trying to draw straight line now
I don't have a ruler but I'm gonna try and draw a straight line
there is gonna be a bit of jitter but even the expensive
Wacom tablets have that
but it's not that much of a butter
there is no input lag at all as you can see so
now we're gonna test the press since 50 so
I talked a little today to the eraser by accident and you can see their pressure
sensitivity is very nice now if you guys want a tutorial on Autodesk SketchBook

hey guys crazy today we are gonna review the Wacom Bamboo pen tablet
I recently bought off at Amazon for $80
now the things that come with the
Wacom tablet are as follows
you have the stylus itself with two programmable buttons
I could set to your liking via the drivers that you installed to your computer
you have a nice user
install help drivers software essentials that come with the
Wacom tablet along with a quick user guide now from the tablet itself it is powered by one
and scroll on the bottom
you could really draw easier than using a mouse and keyboard with this tablet
I found it
you could do
prejudice pressure sensitive
I found this pet
are this graphics tablet very useful in drawing like
click is pan and zoom if you're wondering where
I got this program I bought
this is is a very useful program you can get the trial off of autodesk.com
I highly recommend using this program for any sketchbook or nuts good good for any tablet needs
I give this tablet a perfect 10 out of 10 no cons no nothing
if you're not hey guys
- I'm Aaron Rutten, and today I'll be reviewing a brand new display tablet made by Wacom.
This is the Cintiq 16.
(upbeat music)
The Cintiq 16 is competitively
priced at 649 U.S. dollars.
Let's start this review by taking a quick look at an overview of what the Cintiq 16 can do.
All opinions in this video are my own.
The Wacom Cintiq 16 is a display tablet with a screen that you can draw directly onto.
I was making, but I wouldn't say it held me back.
The Cintiq 16 features an anti-glare screen with a natural paper-like feel.
Color accuracy is important for professionals and artists who print their work.
The Cintiq 16's color gamut is only 72% NTSC which is okay, but not great.
The Cintiq Pros reach nearly 100% of Adobe RGB.
The Cintiq 16 screen and body are built of durable, scratch-resistant materials.
The build quality feels very solid and doesn't feel flimsy or cheap.
There is also an Advanced menu
that will let you control the
Power LED Brightness, if you want to dim it or turn it off altogether.
The legs have rubber feet that grip your desk.
If you prefer more options for positions, you can purchase an optional stand.
I much prefer using the stand, so, in my opinion, it would be best to get one.
It makes the display much more stable and easy to position.
The stand is easily attached using holes for a VESA mounting on the back of the display.
Assembly is easy.
The only trouble I had was attaching it upside down on the first try.
This is especially useful when you are moving the tablet around on your desk.
Remote is supported, which will give you 17 programmable keys that you can use for shortcuts.
So you could live without express keys.
Should your palm graze this area
while drawing, it is possible to accidentally power the screen off, but it's not likely.
Absent on the side of the Cintiq 16 are any USB ports like those found on the Pro models.
But, in my opinion, Wacom has one-upped the competition by showing artists the level of quality
they should expect from a budget display tablet.
I know not
everyone is going to appreciate the higher level of quality
Wacom offers, but allow me to share a few of the ways
the Cintiq differs from the imitations.
Screen glare can make it very difficult to work on a display tablet.
The feel of the screen is also very important.
The Cintiq 16 has a paper-like feel which adds some friction while drawing.
Wacom's Pro Pen
2 is a premium pen.
It's the same pen that's included with the top of the line Cintiq Pros.
The Pro Pen 2 is also cordless, battery-free, and does not require charging.
Don't overlook pen quality when you buy a tablet
Let's not forget that the Pro Pen 2 also supports pen tilt.
Pen tilt is only supported by a few Cintiq alternatives.
The Pro Pen 2 is the best pen you can get for a drawing tablet.
Build quality is one of those things that you have to feel.
It's hard to show in a photo or a video.
The Cintiq 16 and its stand feel durable.
The drawing experience on the Cintiq 16 felt top-notch.
The pen didn't make any accidental marks or wobbly lines.
The transitions in pen
pressure are smooth and easily calibrated for a lighter or heavier touch.
There wasn't any unusual parallax, even near the edges of the screen.
I got exactly the experience I expected from a display tablet.
I've tried.
Wacom has to offer?
Comparing the Cintiq 16 to the Cintiq Pro 13 and 16, the Cintiq 16 does not feature multi-touch.
The Cintiq 16's screen offers a smaller color gamut of only 72% NTSC.
The Cintiq 16 screen has a lower resolution than the Cintiq Pro 16.
The Cintiq Pro 13 is also 1920x1080 HD.
The Cintiq 16 offers fewer display connection options to connect the display to your computer.
The Pro models offer USB-C and DisplayPort, in addition to HDMI.
that you'll find on the Cintiq Pros.
The Cintiq Pro 13 is about $150 more than the Cintiq 16.
The Cintiq Pro 16 is about $750 more than the Cintiq 16, which is more than twice as expensive.
Honestly, the Cintiq 16 covers the essentials pretty well.
I was quite comfortable drawing on it, even though I'm used to having more features available.
Next, I'll recap a bit by discussing the pros and cons of the Cintiq 16, in my opinion.
We'll start with the pros.
The Cintiq 16 is well-built with durable parts.
As I've said earlier, it doesn't feel cheap.
The anti-glare coating and parallax reduction worked really well.
The Pro Pen 2 is top-of-the-line and supports pen tilt.
The Cintiq 16 includes a handy three-in-one cable which I find convenient.
The screen feel of the Cintiq
Pros is definitely nicer, but don't get me wrong, the Cintiq 16 still feels great to draw on.
Another con is that I found it difficult to go from desktop to my lap, with the stand attached.
And even though it's on par with the competition, the Cintiq 16 uses older technology.
That way, you don't miss my new reviews.
The Cintiq Pro 16 is a fantastic budget
display tablet that provides the essential features an artist needs.
But of course you can hide that UI and then get more screen space to draw on.
But the overall drawing experience was great, and I felt right at home on this device.
If this were my first display tablet, I'd be so stoked.
Sure, there are alternatives out
there that are cheaper
If you're looking for an excellent, entry-level display tablet, the Cintiq 16 is it.

Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.

hi there
I'm really excited to show you this new product today
it's the Z 20 T from Toshiba
it houses a big battery that doubles effectively
the runtime of the tablet nice keyboard supports along the sides
but apart from that you really don't need it to run the device
Toshiba have built into the Z 20
you can see that
now what that effectively means of course is when
so this means that
one of the great things about the z22 is that it's powered by the latest generation
the first one is that the battery life is much longer than the previous generation
so there's always been improvements in battery life
Broadwell is no exception but the big thing that you will notice by looking at around the Z 20t
there's no fan vents
so you've easily got all-day battery life on this device in fact
in addition to having the latest processor
there is a very small slot inside the tablet itself
just there for a small pen
something small skinny like that
it's a Wacom pen that will work on these devices in Australia
I think that the z20 T from Toshiba is going to be a massive hit for companies
what's up y'all time for another tablet review with more touhou art
i don't understand what the thing is with me doing
touhou art specifically of characters in suits and tablet reviews
funnily enough this is also a redraw which like the last tablet review i did was also a redraw
yomu in a suit is just something that works
they didn't pay me for this review
aside from sending me the review copy of the tablet
so this is all just my honest thoughts on this model and this thing is an absolute unit
it is 22 inches about as big as my secondary monitor
it is very much
the tablet itself comes with an adjustable stand which is also super nice and very welcome
that's great for transport the sticker on the pen however is very sticky
we have a lot of screen
real estate to work with
the tablet is very bright and has a very rich color space
it was so bright that i actually had to turn it down a touch when i first got it
each model i received from xp pen has been very accurate color
wise and the artist 22 2g continues
this trend its color
space is only like two percent smaller than the innovator 16 which was actually my last tablet
i reviewed and the one i was using up before this point
nowadays it has 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity and also includes 60 degrees of tilt support
it could be that
i'm just used to xp pens
coming from an innovator 16 it's virtually no different
it comes with two cables to attach to the pc
it can support both a standard usb and a usb-c connection now
you have your power
adapter your hdmi cable and your usb connector
it also has a headset jack
for some reason the cables themselves are actually a little on the short side
it also comes with a cleaning cloth and a glove also one little aside
this isn't specific to the artist 22
it's just a general psa for any screen tablet users when your tablet is plugged in
the innovator 16 actually have this issue to solve this one
you have to unplug it and then plug it back
in the artist 22 fortunately fully shuts off the screen
but they'll operate like a non-screen tablet until you plug it in
there is a small weird behavior when powering it back on as your computer will detect that
there's a new monitor but the drivers won't until after you restart the drivers
this might be something that can be solved in a driver
it's a pretty simple work around beyond that
the drivers are as no frills as the tablet itself
since there's no express keys there's no extra windows it just has a simple customizable
xp pens routinely made great tablets and the artist
22 is no exception
they're not paying me to say any of this
they just gave me the review copy
and this is my honest opinion of this tablet
anyway here's yomu in a suit it's just kind of too natural of a fit
the redraw looks so much more dynamic and better proportion than the original in my opinion
art ruts are weird
everybody kind of goes through cycles with their art anyway
i still have yet to play any touhou game
also i love you bye you
ah that's a lot of buttons
hey yeah it's me shadow or chad or whatever floats your boat
really if you haven't heard my voice before hi yes i am a gross american
i received an email from gaomon asking me to review their tablet
the m106k pro pen tablet
this is a really cool opportunity so i said yes and now i'm here to talk about it
more information is in the description and later in the video now
let's unbox this baby
we've got the tablet itself we have a
what is this
oh a bag
it's a bag feet like a glove
you know what else fits like a glove
this glove segway is going strong then
we have lots of paper
i can't read
there are some manuals that has an untrained professional
i don't need to use driver
download a nice little note
then we have this and that
what's in these you'll never know
ah just kidding
it's a bunch of pen
nibs and a pen holder mystery over some adapters
the cord and usb and the pen
you can find the driver at www.gammon.net download or in the link in the description now
we need to find the tablet to download the wait
what am i m106k pro
this tablet is much bigger than the pen tablet
i started out on and that was super duper
nice it's got lots of surface area to maneuver around and mess with the pen
itself isn't battery powered
i used to struggle a lot
taking out pen dips when they were worn down but no longer no struggle for me
the keyboard shortcut buttons
there are so many
i use them avidly while making this speed paint
actually the fact that they included a glove in here was awesome as well
i actually still have it on right now at the time of recording this
i didn't have one of these when i started out
and it was really cool to receive one with the tablet instead of just buying it separately
it keeps my greasy greasy hands off the nice the nice cool tablet and it makes me feel cool
it's it fits really nicely too
i have pretty small hands
so it's like a fourth the size too big for me but point is is that it still works
and that's not that big of a problem all in all
i didn't find any glaring issues with this tablet
i'd recommend it to anybody starting out
it was very inexpensive for its quality and that was fantastic
it was really easy to use
this was a very great tablet to work with
it was an awesome opportunity
hold up real quick before you go
they're having a lightning sale on some of their tablets
so go ahead and check the description for those thanks
hey guys this is big a 50 tablet and in this video
I am going to review it and tell you if it's worth buying
I have already done unboxing and first impressions video about this
big a 50 tablet which you can check in the description below or click on the
this tablet can be very very useful and it can be used casually as well like a mouse
okay so first thing that
I loved about this week
a fifty is its build quality like the fit and finish is really nice as well as sleek
it just looks like a chocolate bar
make sure you don't eat it
I use this gesture pad to zoom in and zoom out by swiping up and down respectively
double that using two fingers to fit on the screen
I felt in knowing which button you are pressing attention to detail like this on
the tablet is very helpful
this tablet is not compatible with mobile devices
of course it can be used with
Mac operating system as well as Windows now in order to connect the tablet
you need to download the driver
just go to week
two tablet website
it's not complicated
it's very easy just single
now here you can systemize all the lay out like how much space you want to use
the awesome thing about this tablet here is there is actually option to use it like a mouse
so how's the pen
well first of all it's battery free
the default one is for brush and eraser swap
and the other one for right-click action
I wish the button was slightly texturized or maybe slightly more prominent
helped me actually resolve that so
I feel now
I wish the pen came with the dock or a stand or at least there was a cap for this one
I highly recommend you buy this one and just look at the price
now remember this has a unique gesture pad again
which makes it a very unique tablet so the link is in the description
this is Lisa from mobile tech review
this is a slightly lighter gray bezel but that we've got the exact same industrial design
millimeter headphone jack
up here
we've got a micro
SD card slot
here doesn't come with the card
you can put a card in here
I've been very own that's the HTC high-capacity cards are accepted speaker
back here nice
little rubbery back much the same as the nut collar in fact almost identical this changes
what's inside here
we saw the same 7 inch
IPS display technology which means nice sharp really wide viewing angles 1024 by 600 resolution
pretty common for 7-inch tablets of all kind but inside we've now got a dual-core 1 gigahertz
CPU that's much much
it was very easy to do
I'm sure this is gonna be rudabeh
l-- put your own apps on there
put a w flash on there you discover all kind of sluggish
this guy zipped it right along nice improvement
it's also has twice the memory inside twice the ram that is to run programs
here's a gotcha
though of the 16 gigs
only one gig is available for your use everything else is serve for
so you don't get a whole lot of accessible user internal storage there underneath this runs
it would be against the rules
Android tablet would say like the HTC Flyer that sells for $2.99
so you're a more sandboxed here now
of course if you're rooted you can do all sorts of things to it
terms of interface
things are pretty much
stay the same
the fire is not bad you can see
that takes you back into your book
the newsstand movies music and apps
everything look at the books
it's pretty much the same stuff that we've seen before once again
got the book that
I'm reading currently right here
they did a really good job with with periodicals
take a look at magazines
this is a little small on the seven-inch screen phantes ennoble says
something that amazon can't offer but and then again
I would say for online support Amazon
still wins in terms of customer service
so if you want to access your library just tap here and there's your library right now
we're looking at our application library of shortcuts to books magazines newspapers
no kids stuff which is really pretty cold and my stuff which is documents
we'll take a look at that later
so here's the books that
you just have it and there any of you download in terms of books
we've got pretty much again the same thing as with enough coloring here
we have a book open that
I've made a bookmark on like any touch screen reader or LCD
we're jelly topping
up with the quarters gonna set you up a bookmark
you can turn page animations on and off and you can either swipe or a tap to change a page page
turn speeds obviously fine
there's no eating professor a business
it's not an eating device it is an IPS
LCD display tap near the top and it brings up options here
you can get your table of contents
turn that on and off
this is an
that's used by
Kobo books Sony Reader Google Books
I side loaded this book
it's able to match up the book since
don't you want to look it up
it's nice it's a little compact wind out here
there's a shortcut a sea of Google
now when you're reading epub books you're the ones that you've got from
it does paginate that way as well
we take a look at applications
this is what I've got pre-installed right now
you've got an email application where Capri and IMAP email
I've downloaded ever know
it was so popular it does
Hulu Plus and Netflix
these were both pre-installed out of the box in fact there's Netflix
integration right into the settings you can set your account information right there
Netflix works great on this by the way
so those things like
there are some notable admissions like
I wanted to find a file manager
no kids is always a cool thing
they have interactive books
so really there's so far doing them the best from anybody
there are some pretty cool
iPad books for kids too
but so you got read to me
read to myself
read and record read greeting bucks
tomato car is read lolis
Apple car is read
so is his sneaker fire
engines are read
good for you there we go
anything that you've used for lend me and archived items so my files
I've put some PDFs so you can see what that's like first
I have a sign
that's heavily Illustrated
we have a user manual for an upper computer here and again
we're using the vnn reader to look at it illustrations and we'll try it in landscape mode
well that's pretty readable for a heavily
Illustrated PDF there is no changing point size or anything like that
so you're always going to have a real true
PDF view here
we have an application called my media and that's for playing
look at your photos as a bunch of sample photos
it comes with in video
that's what it plays works
it does remember where you were
if you walk away
hit stop and then come back to it alright
so how about Netflix
I know I'm you're probably excited by that
and by the way this does do Hulu
Plus as well
we're gonna check out
Netflix right now so we are playing Netflix
wow that's really good
what this tablet does mean it access anywhere
Netflix is a bingo this is what your Netflix interface
looks like
it does also work in landscape mode
and we've got a music player onboard plus a 3.5 millimeter
jack so gives me the options of using my two music apps here
I'm finding some more music after it's going to go with the straight music player
I think you all know what pandora looks like and there it is complete with cover art
you can switch to a listing view
you can search for stuff loop and all that kind of thing and yes it
plays in the background
I like this better than Kindle
Fires a teeny little keyboard
I'll check out the New York Times
so here's the New York Times full web page by default which is nice responsive to scrolling
it's a very good experience there
and there was a embedded video on the front page
let's check that out
is your bookmark screen
here was our website quickly enough
it'll take a look at our Kindle Fire video review using Adobe Flash Player
I'll pop it up to full screen
480p thanks fine place mafia
the controls are very usable as well
it's just the casing is a little bit smaller but the nope surprising way is just a little bit less
this is fourteen point
six ounces versus fourteen point one both of them being a little bit on the heavy side
you're talking about a weighty book they're not too bad both of IPS displays and in bright light
I would say that the Nook is a little bit more contrast II and readable
so that's the Barnes and Noble Nook Tablet available in November
it's obviously an easy choice
this guy is epub based and it works with
Barnes & Noble for those of you were all about Kindle products and services well Amazon
he has a leg up there
they both work with public library books
they both can display
PDFs I'm Lisa from mobile tech review
visit our website to read the full review of the Barnes & Noble Nook Tablet

hi everyone and welcome to this video
I was recently contacted by huion and they very kindly asked if I could try out their canvas
GT 191 tablets
they haven't paid me
they just wanted to send the tablet along for me to give my honest review in this video
so that's what I'm going to do
so that's a really nice touch
it also comes with the installation
CD and the user manual along with two pens
I was really happy to see this
GT 191 tablets itself along with the stand
I'm super impressed
I should also mention
there's a screen protector that comes attached to the screen
I had everything up and running and I was ready to start working
I was making sure to test that that's why I was working on a drawing with lots of hair
love the stand with it
you're able to adjust the screen to any angle
you need which is extremely helpful
a lot of other tablets that
I've tried in the past
everything was fixed and it was working fine after that
I was quite sad to see that there are no buttons on the tablet itself
I usually love to have a few buttons that I can change the presets
it really helps to streamline the workflow
it's super fun if you are interested in checking out this tablet for yourself then
I've left some links down below for you to have a look and I really
I've had so much fun making this video
I can't wait to attempt some large landscape paintings
ghoul inspired character and thank you so much again to huion for supporting the channel
I really appreciate this opportunity
it means a lot
they've really mean a lot to me if you'd like to follow my progress and see progress photos before
I post these videos
and let's get it
unboxed just came in the mail today
total of forty seven dollars and some odd cents and that does include shipping
I paid for it
alright take it out of the box as you can see
it's a fairly good sized tablet and I have kind of big hands so it's got plenty of working area
I got your hotkeys right here at the top and they're programmable and it also has I
can you know thumbnail on it
I like to do so I can draw something on paper
slip it up under there and instantly digitize it that other way now comes with spare spare pen tip
there are the battery to the end
the driver software it also comes with a software suite
I don't know if it says on the back yes
it does annotation forward pin command or pin signature pin male pin notice
I'll be going over all those later
I had nice eyes though feel sky between the plastic
oh and comes with a little stand to keep your pin in okay
I've got the device up and running
maybe kind of an awkward
angling me trying to work this because the tripods right here in front of me so
I'm having to work around it so as you can see nice large tablet
the pin seems a little on the cheap side as far as build quality
I don't know that you see one
button is obviously the pin tip but this button right here is not just a single button
it's got a front part and a back part and you can set the buttons to be whatever you want
in this case the front is middle
click for me
the back is right
click for me now as you can notice
I'm using two screens on my computer and it does work with both screens and some little awkward
because you see this tablet down here okay
that's my screen here
well and then you realize oh oh
I've crossed over to this other one by mistake
now some programs will override that for example now
I'm in and overrides it and it uses the whole screen is just this one
the whole tablet is just that one screen but if I was to quit yeah discard it
goes back once you click on the desktop
oops okay what
I do now
okay so but the jump
cut there as you can see
pin notice probably does pin notice
I click on it
I want to tell them
oh you want to click on that right there
but we don't want to so
why don't we exit that out
yes and oh no
I say did anyway
no well just delete that later and but like
I said it also disables your second screen temporarily while that program is running
it's like a taskbar icon in Windows XP except windows 7 taskbar icons are kind of weird
sometimes they stroking the taskbar sometimes
it'll go back to letting you use two screens
it's supposed to let you sign your emails and your
it's a little easier to see but that's all you can do is you is draw
that's but that is all that will run on
Windows 7 or at least all that mine runs on Windows 7
odds are they haven't updated it
hopefully they will in the future
those are pretty many programs but now let's try drawing
something is a free open source image editing program and it's really good
I like using it
one it locks it to one screen
well that ordinarily is pretty good
I like but the problem is
let's see move that up file new
let's see if it'll do it again yeah
I don't know if you can tell
but you can see my cursor right here well where it actually is picking up where you're drawing
I'm pretty sure that's just a with or the compatibility with and windows 700 shoe touch revert
I chose cloned the screen show only on one there
let's make this bigger
it supports the texture
as you can see
I said campus free and it's very powerful layers all sorts of tools smudge tools pretty much
you don't draw the same old line no matter how hard you press down on this thing so right now
any program like you know
if you find that to be easier you can you can do that
you know you have all of these are programmable but as you can see they have you know webmail
Emison such like that
but you can make msn open up your email or whatever you want to do
I still like the mouse I bought this mainly to just doodle with but so but is it worth the value
I mean yes it is I have used I had in the past a Wacom pen partner and I would still be using it
unfortunately it was a serial it was in a USB
I mean I don't even know of a new computer you can buy
that has one of those
you'd have to build it yourself by buying a motherboard
that actually has a serial port still on it so
Wacom was for example like the Wacom pen or the Wacom pin and touch if you want the touch feature
this doesn't by the way you cannot use your finger on this so just the
total the actual unit the actual using area is even smaller than that
maybe the outline as you can see here but I mean I can't even fit it in the shot
that's how much bigger this thing is
it works amazing
here's where you choose your button but you can also choose your scope so for example
let's say you don't want to use this whole big or huge working area
what's also cool is you can do screen ratio whoops okay full area screen ratio so
I have a sixteen by nine monitor and it automatically sizes it to 1600 by 900
edge is where it puts a little dead area all the way around it for example
like if you had a program they had like a thicker border
I have to say you can also adjust your pressure in here and test it around and whatnot
uh and there's hot cells as well and you can set the hot cells to like
but it's all it enough
it doesn't bend or anything that I can tell and it works
I have about this the and the pin base
I consider that part of it
but it's really not that big of an issue especially considering that a
Wacom is sixty to seventy dollars and this is just not as well
just say fifty bucks to make things simple and it's much much bigger
hello internet world and welcome to my review of the vast king kingpad sa10
this is an android version
10 tablet very kindly sent in free of charge by the manufacturer
they haven't asked me to say anything in particular nor have they asked to pre-approve this video
so this tablet is very impressive indeed
let's just unlock it
and you can see a very wide screen
it's an ultra wide screen 10 inches 1080p display
it's got an octa-core processor inside three gigabytes of ram and 32 gigabytes of storage
metal design
it's a very very nice tablet
i've been really impressed with it
the processor inside is an octa-core processor
there's a little bit of lag as you saw there
i've been very impressed
also we do get a calculator calendar and of course
the camera app built in and google chrome for browsing the internet
i think this is a really good offering
it's actually very keenly priced a nice budget tablet but with a good quality ips display
technology used the viewing angles are very good as well
that's it for this video
thank you very much for watching
today I have the m0 610 Pro from artis all a pen
tablet that has customized LEDs to inspire that artist within all of us
but how does the tablet perform well
we're gonna go over that in a minute now
what's a pen tablet
a pen tablet is a device
you place on your desk connected to your computer you draw on the pent
Apple itself while observing what
I'm John and what I'm not out saving the universe
I do tutorials and reviews on hardware and software
that's using a creative process
nowadays is a nice felt velcro pen case holder
you can store your pen and all your nibs in here next
we'll cover that later
there were two bag of nibs and a nib remover
and basically there you have it
there's your nice piece of kit right there
Pro is a pen tablet
it is electromagnetic resonance
EMR for short
the tablet size is 10 by 6 inches and it has an industry-leading 300 PPS report rate
that's basically how fast the mouse talks to the actual tablet itself
one key is available to cycle through those modes
finally there's a customizable quick dial and we'll cover that in a second
DM 0 610 Pro comes with the P 58 B digital pen
this is a battery free
this is one of the more unique pens
it's more like a clicky kind of gift
both the top of the pen and the back of the pen are rounded all the way around
one is turning it off
I could see this being a hit
especially with a lot of the gamer guys
now right we all have these
RGB keyboards and you know
I'd see myself spending time
here you're trying to sync this thing up to my different
RGB profiles with my mouse and keyboard
man I really should get out more
okay going through the driver so real quick
this is the dashboard links to the website
fast access
that are out there
I really appreciated that because I can never remember half the shortcut keys in the pen settings
this is where we set up our buttons test pressure
adjust the pressure curve
mapping if you have both the monitors you need to tell the tablet which monitor
you're looking at this down here preference
settings is where you gonna go to configure your different profiles per application now
the drive will to cycle through them if you open the program
unfortunately it doesn't map to the exe
maybe that's something we'll see later on
add it into the driver the Android functionality works as it should
you'll use one of the included micro USB or USB c2 USB a converters
the functionality works
well there's no configuration needed
you just open up your art app of choice
I chose SketchBook Pro and you could see it just works
we're just starting to get some line quality tests and what
I'm really trying to do here
is show that light medium to hard brush
strokes as far as pressure goes
the artisinal tablet does deliver those three different levels of gradient that
I'm looking for moving on
I really want to make sure there's no pen lag
this is an EMR device after all
I'm seeing on screen is what's happening
I'm not noticing any lag in the lines and since it's a pen tablet
strokes look really good
you know from beginning to end and at the end of that circle you could see once again
I'm able to drop back to a nice light stroke
no tests are nice but you want to see
both of my pencil work and also some shading exercises that
I tried out meeting the gradients
we sort of talked about and that pencil work stuff is really important to me
now one thing I do have to mention
I was experiencing but wasn't yet ready for primetime case
anybody hasn't heard there's this little issue of a pandemic going on so
what's critical is that
the tablet overall was fun to use
that's really the thing right you know
what's the experience with the tablet overall
I had a good experience
I liked the company and I like the slogan now
I like to point out some of the things I'd like to see improve now
the m20 610
send me a beta one so
what's going on YouTube John here today
we're taking a look at the Sony
Xperia z2 tablet the successor to Sony's Xperia Z tablet last year
Oh point 25 inches and how minimalistic it really is here on the back
and it's a 10.1
Z last year which
I didn't get a chance to review the z2 is running the latest version of Android 4.4
point2 and it runs it
I've tried with a skin on top
that comes close to pure
Android and being a Sony Tablet
you're going to find the 8.1 megapixel camera
do not take pictures with your tablet
it does do okay with the pictures and the video most tablets
I was very happy with the Sony
as well and runs everything
pretty much lag free has a nice 6,000 milliamp battery which lasts very long
give me comments or questions about the
Xperia z2 tablet
leave those down below in the comments section
hey guys the CTA Prime back here again
I'm just gonna be referring to it as the m16
US dollars but I have seen it on sale for one hundred and sixty one thing
there's definitely a little photoshopping going on with those promotional pictures
the m16 does support a detachable keyboard
it'll only do 1080p out
even looking at a head-on so a specs go for the CPU
so you can pick up that 5 gigahertz
Network Bluetooth 4.2 USB type-c for charging and sync micro HDMI out a 3.5 millimeter audio jack
8 megapixel rear camera 2.1 megapixel front and is running
Android 8.1 as for battery life
eight to nine hours mixed-use
I did check for updates
but you never know if you're gonna get an update from a company like this loading up
Netflix is super fast
it's got that AC Wi-Fi built-in and I did run a test
we'll head over to YouTube and check out a 1080p video as you can see it loads up pretty quickly
we'll go full screen with it and make sure we're at 1080p here
so video streaming on this device is going to be perfectly fine whether you want to use
Amazon crime Hulu Netflix YouTube
it's telling me that it's running at 53
I have the new 2019
fire 10 tablet
these are 149 dollars and they go on sale for 99 all the time and on the left hand side
we have the m16
over on the fire 10 single core 1402 multi-core 5000 203
I actually wasn't expecting this
we have antutu
this is version 8
on the m16
we're running when it comes to these easier to run touch base mobile games
the m16 is perfectly fine but when we move over to something a little higher in like
Call of Duty mobile
we get a bit of lag now personally
I've seen a lot worse on lower in tablets
I do have the graphic set to low and the framerate set to low but one of the biggest issues
I'm having here is the touch screen itself
I'm having with the screen here
transfers over to other games like pub
we have minecraft
it's not as smooth as I was hoping it would be keep in mind
I tested these games
consecutively so this thing is getting a bit hot on the back with that
I also wanted to give a little emulation in here
this is ppsspp running
I've tried OpenGL and Vulcan
it seems to run better with
Capcom 2 645 480 the lowest resolution
there's really nothing else
so let's move over to Dead or Alive to 640 by 480 and we're around 43 to 45 fps
just to give you a look here
the internal resolution is set at 640 by 480
so there's nothing else
I can do to make this game run any better so in the end
it's really hard for me to recommend this m16 tablet for pretty much
anybody um there are better tablets out there for cheaper unfortunately this mediatek X 27 CPU
just isn't up to par for native
Android gaming or even emulation
it does work great for video playback web browsing email viewing and things like that
but if you're buying a $200 Android tablet
I really appreciate you watching
if you have any questions let me know in the comments below but like always
thanks for watching you
hello everybody how you doing
that idiot comes
turn it around
here's your specs a processor
you know the gyro
I know because my galaxy s2 charger is right there and it works
oh ok drop the other piece there you go and then that's what it looks like from the back
Scott are you you know points and stuff which I could just show you
that on the tablet itself
check out sit right here
so here's your slots as you charge your port
Mike got headphones
and your memory card
and that's just a speaker on this side
got power there volumes plus and minus there
then you got a redo button there
just turn it on
that takes a rather long time to boot
I'm sorry about that
it's just pretty slow and whatnot when it comes to this he has a little
Android dude running around now by far one of the best qualities about this item
is that if you wear glasses
it's done booting up now thank
Jesus took forever
your added donations now your unlock button there
unlock it now
this is running on 4.0
I already told you that I'll show you the camera or quit
it's not very good but there's me holding the phone in front of my face
I'll go ahead and show you a picture that I took with the camera earlier
of course it doesn't show as good as it really is
it's a pretty good picture
hey guy that's about as good as it is on the camera
just go home
show you how it runs on a game like Minecraft to where it's dynamically changing
go ahead and clear up
the controls are inverted
I almost forgot me fix it
oh yeah okay as that runs on minecraft
I think it runs pretty good
of course you're not singing as good as this and it comes with a little stylus pen you get with it
I don't really like it that much because it almost never really does what it's supposed to do
looks good when you're chopping wood
damn so everything rolling here nice and smooth
I want to kill that chicken now
I leave it alone anyway
that's my review
the jazz tablet runs real
good real fast and you could press this little button down there what these buttons do
I'll show you this
is the back button right here
it'll just take you back to whatever you're doing unless you're already on the home page
that's your home button
it'll take you to the home page volume down buttons on the screen volume up button on the screen
brings you to the recent apps
I had minecraft open
remember how long it took for me to load minecraft
well watch this
now that's a big plus come standard with iHeartRadio as well
Facebook and fruit ninja
free comes with along the flash player
seems my tablet had a little slope a check but click on their search
it's pretty fast even though
I only have one bar of connectivity
still pretty fast enjoyable and bring up my pages flick off these guys
and there's my review for the tablet
gasps you love from people you trust
this is toys
I was doing the radio show this weekend
I think it was and somebody said
did you see that wind
book has a tablet the TW 700 tablet and Micro Center is selling this for $59.99
I got it on Amazon with Amazon Prime so I got it right away and that was $59.99 plus $10 so $69.99
but this is it this is it you get a Windows
8.1 tablet seven inches
let me tell you a little bit about it
it is an IPS screen
I'll enter my
it's okay you can see my pin
I don't care enter my pin so we can log in and see it
it is a touch tablet
not the fastest processor it's a system-on-a-chip the Intel Bay Trail processor
it comes with 16
gigs of internal storage
that's worth more than $59 in fact
I was thinking so he came with that
it comes with it
I'm set up all your stuff
was there all my stuff is there
OneNote this is that this is not some cheap Microsoft Office
this is the full
Microsoft Office in a 7 inch tablet quad-core processor
don't be fooled by that
it isn't the super fastest process in the world
there's no windows
but which is what you'd expect but there's a physical button that'll bring you back to the desktop
so it's a little less convenient than tapping the windows button but it still works
what's it like using the classic environment
you tried it the classic environment you know mean the desktop or the desktop
it's I mean here's the issue with this
this is 1280 by 800
which on a seven-inch screen well you know
I almost would say ouch
I should have a higher screen because screen because all my phones are more than that
but you know it's almost look how small these icons are it's almost too small to tap an icon
the cool thing about this
what it's got me excited about this is that you can just use a standard
USB port on the side right there is
that's really an you can connect a keyboard and mouse to that or like
Logitech receiver and you can dock this to HDMI to a large screen
and now you have this right below and PC that runs actual Windows right legacy windows on
yes mini mini
HDMI full-size USB to not three
it charges via micro
here's our chat room running in the background all the time
here's Skype actually
sound is not great
when what did you expect come on by its fifty nine dollars by five but you could plug in
yeah and you could plug in a now
see how hard even at 1280 by 800
how hard is it those little things there to make that go fullscreen
let's turn it up and we can hear Bruno Mars and Mars Ronson funk it funkify just touch the screen
I'm gonna put it up to the microphone so you can hear
it's got dual
it's got dual speakers coming out of the bottom such a good song
but you're not exactly getting the full bass and look at this
is the video playback
this is youtube
high-def video plays back
Wow back yeah
it's probably good enough for Skype
let me find the camera under why they don't save the money and just put a better front camera
only if don't put a camera in at all what do you do it for
Skype I guess
you have to put a frank so just put a better front camera and don't put it
yeah that would be is my budget
I think that'd be the smart way to go
I'm trying can't see a little tiny
I'm pretty amazing
that's eight hundred by twelve
you don't feel like this is slow do you
I mean it feels like that is the first time
I've launched this cooking app so that's a little
this is gonna look at this watt corner this is scrolling
I'm not I'm not feeling any
he's it's got 802 1011
B G and N it's an IPS screen
but you can see it's not a bad looking screen even at an angle
but it's pretty good
you know you're really you're not no
it's it's amazing it's better than the Acer tablet from two years ago that amount
I feel like it's a king cake for Mardi Gras
I feel like we're living in amazing times for $59 you can get a seven-inch tablet
that's our chat room
they're chatting at me
oh yeah you can even use snap so you can you know you can you can multitask and I'll be honest
I've got as you can see a bunch of apps going
I don't feel like it's that slow no
I'm using a lot of RAM here
I think this is pretty impressive
you can run desktop app you can get an Android tablet $59 and it's not an Android
we're not clear on why it's so cheap
that would cost you more
I have unlimited onedrive storage because I have an office 365 subscription
that's one thing to note if you already have an office
365 subscription you
sign into your account your windows account as I did on this tablet
you won't be able to take advantage of the free version of Office
you have to use your own existing version of
Office big deal
this is a good gift
yeah pros and cons the pros
the price is unbelievable
this would be great for a kid or a student also a full size
USB means you can use a keyboard and mouse with it that's great
I should hook it up but I didn't think of that
if do we have a mini
HDMI converter I could hook it up and we could see what the screen looks like
it is a very surprisingly good for the price
1280 by 800
IPS screen very legible
very bright colors sound is not great
I would say that's a con
the cameras are super con
it's terrible but again
I don't think you should buy this for a camera it's probably adequate to do Skype
and it's certainly adequate for some you know lightweight computing
you probably want to stick just because of the size of the screen 7 inch screen
you probably want stick with the modern apps
I mean an Excel spreadsheet at 1280 by 800 on a 7-inch
it's not gonna be that easy the other thing you can do is adjust the native resolution
you can't oh look
I could do that these icons No so you just have to
I didn't mention battery life that's another Pro
believe it or not about five hours battery life for charge
yeah that's not iPad level but it's good enough $59.99 plus shipping
it comes out under $70 for the win-win book tw7 hundred tablet definitely
so if you've got a use for it a BA I mean I don't know what I'm gonna do with it so it's the win
this would be amazing
this is just pretty impressive
there's a regular USB on that's I think around the table
yeah well you could fit $59
it's not a really expensive mean by five
yeah by five yeah
I just - somebody says
can you show the keyboard
the keyboard is actually very usable
this is very much like an iPad keyboard
it's because it's seven inches
it's thumb typable which is actually makes it particularly useful so
I like this win book
I'm gonna say that to the chat room
it's got predictive type and there goes boom
Booya it's the win
it's a win for the wind book
can you believe that
Wow Wow a full-size PC is seven-inch box
today I will be reviewing the lincei 7-inch Android tablet I found
this tablet was affordable in
hope it's not garbage
the seven-inch screen resolution is actually decent other than the charging port
the only other device port is the auxiliary jack for the headphones
the internal speakers are not very loud and sound better from the bottom of the will so
I did also notice with the volume all the way up
the power was disintegrating a little bit more than a percent a minute there is no doubt
which will have that familiar interface all
they're almost pointless overall
this tablet will actually still serve its purpose for the specific reason
I bought it which was strictly playing videos for my kids while it drives
it says the battery life is trash
I use poor man's ingenuity and just kept
the device plugged in at all times while in use that way it stays charged since apps
use up too much memory for this tablet
I downloaded a few hours of videos on the SD card however I will still say on hot days
I do not leave in the car because it just tends to run too hot is this $45 tablet worth it
most likely not worth it
thanks again for watching and as always until next time
hello everyone welcome to my channel
today we are going to unbox some
uh a new tablet from sam's lab x-a-x-e-n-c-e lbe i think s 7 slab

we go nice all right
this looks pretty for me
yep i haven't tried any new helmet in the recent past few years
i hope this one would be a good one
so i'm going to plug it in today and test drive stick but for now i'm just gonna put it back here
they've got like three buttons
okay next oh you have nice
you have like a bag so you can like put your tablet in there
it's pretty neat
so let's see
wow i've never seen that before so you have you can
oh nice let me show you
what's inside oh soft okay
wow it's like my christmas here and then you can put the rest of these in here i think
oh these are the gloves and the usb 3.
yeah i'm putting it back in because i'm going to go
i'm at my house right now so um i am going for work
this is like early in the morning
it's like 5 30 in that coffee
um this one doesn't have any battery on it surprising
wow it looks pretty solid amazing
so i'm just gonna put everything back in place the back
i really loved it like it's pretty good idea
you have like the bag
yeah this is fantastic
let's try it out so that's the way you can
wow interesting it looks pretty solid so yeah all right all right guys
so uh i'm just gonna go plug it in to my computer in the office
how does it hold up for and you know
i'll try to do something in photoshop
so yeah we're just going to uh uh watch a test um all right guys and yeah some of this
while this day i might give you a tour of my studio for now
you just test out the topic
thank you very much since lab and um wow
it's surprisingly way better than i thought it would be
i was expecting like i have to put some battery on and things like that
apparently not this one okay
there you go
if it's good then you guys should definitely buy it but i think so far
it looked pretty promising
you got those nips over there different type of nips that you can use and you
and if you prefer the smaller grips um then this would be pretty awesome
and i like the bigger grips and it's it's it looks pretty awesome
it feels solid and the box
the box that kept the pen came pretty nice which is uh unbeatable
you can carry them everywhere
and when they open up the package there were surprisingly they said it was pretty good quality
it's the pen got nice weight
and the tablet got a really nice and neat um package and it looks expensive
at first
and the way you you work on your line feels very very good
just like the wacom tablet
but um you might have to put a little more pressure than usual
i really like the the weight of the pen the way it can feel pretty much
uh like how the pen or the pencil
it is heavier than the wacom pen
it would be one of my top choice if i have to use it to work on it professionally
i think you you are able to do it
and all the packaging and the tablet itself everything looks pretty solid
it looks like a very very high quality products and they're not paying me for this
they just send me the product so i can try
so that's just my honest opinion
i think this might be their first generation
i'm not sure but i haven't seen anything like it
he's doing some quick environment painting so you can kind of observe it
it's going to be sped up so but you will get the feel of of what it's capable of in the beginning
we're just doing the drawing in the drawing the line drawn the thick and thin
uh the light and dark and all the opacity all the pressure sensitivity
everything works out just really awesome
it's it's like the first
they were surprised that this tablet is really good and i was kind of surprised too
i got kind of like taken away i was like
whoa um why is this
this thing is better than i thought because usually you see
uh some of the tablet comments came out in the market
and you're like ah they're not as you know as good as welcome
i think you will be surprised
how good it is
i promise you i will do an actual maybe tutorial or more painting that i'll do myself recently
i didn't have a lot of time
you can look at it on my youtube link or my social media thing and thanks again for um having me
try out this tablet
i mean honestly it is really good
all right guys well have a good rest of the day and enjoy the painting bye you
it'll look like the cell phone in landscape version
you get your back home and your multi-screen window with all of your applications running
why you buy this is for your eyes because it really looking at it
it will tell you if it's too close to your face
which is why you're buying this in the first place
we do have still 18 hours remaining
of course this is just an estimate it's like an mpg rating for a car
all of this will change based on
you turn it for example if i tilt it down
you're starting to see more oranges and that is true
it's almost like a chameleon screen and because there is no color whatsoever
it's almost like you're looking at something
that has been etched into a piece of metal because it's not quite yellow
it's not quite silver
it's not quite white
it's not gray
it's just kind of metal colored
if you're just joining us this is our lcd
meaning that this is not e-ink it looks like you're looking at e-ink but it's not
it is liquid crystal display
you have absolutely no issues watching videos whatsoever
they will play at full frame rate
they will play at full quality
they will play play
in high definition
there will be no color
there is no color on this device
that is not why you're buying this device
this is for people that want
basically an e-ink device that can't stand the lack of refresh
there is no refresh issues whatsoever
it's a 10.5 inch screen
meaning you have that much more screen real estate than say your cell phone
you're carrying around in your pocket and this does have lcd
it's quick there's no issues with glare of any kind you can see that there
how does the ebook experience look on this device as you may ask you will see
it looks quite nice
it is very very responsive you do have the ability to pinch and zoom now
of course all of this will come down to the individual application
if you're holding it like that how much can fit on the screen etc
this is exactly what people were waiting for an e-ink type screen
that isn't e-ink it's lcd but it's not really lcd
it's our lcd
meaning you get the best of all worlds
it has a 5 000 milliamp battery
this thing is going to last a long time
q5 rlcd 10.5 inch tablet
this is peter you
hello my cuties and welcome back
i hope you're all doing well so last video
i talked about how to start the process of making a comic so this time
we're gonna break it down to actually beginning the actual drawing for the pages
i also have this gorgeous tablet
i'll be showing off at the end of the video so please stay tuned for that
there are a couple ways you can go about this and each way is to your own personal comfort
so i'll try to cover
a few starting off is going to be how i personally do comics and plan them
i can open up and see what i need to do now
many comic artists like to write a full script and write out
so what i do instead
it's been a huge file in my drawing program and i create little rectangles for the pages
it looks like this
then i'll start the thumbnails now
thumbnails are messy and quick
try not to spend more than like 30 seconds on each one
what an item is
it's just write it
this is how it typically looks for me and oftentimes by the time i get to the actual page
i'll draw about six pages
then take a break come back to it later
it's time to sketch the actual pages
a good thing to do is sketch up
most of the chapter first so
but i'm aware it can get overwhelming and boring
one of the biggest things to work on is style consistency
hence why sketching up the pages in big batches can help
i keep all my shading colors and my drawing program with the colors on hand and different lighting
each page takes around three to four hours to finish sometimes longer
depending on how many panels there are and the detail
because you're your own boss
also keep in mind that readers will only spend about 30 seconds
max on each page while you will spend hours making it
i would also highly recommend planning panels around your speech bubbles
they're extremely important to any comic
so focus on them
if you're using clip studio paint like i am
i've considered going back and fixing some of the older pages
so don't do what i did
speaking of speech bubbles another thing to keep in mind while working on pages
is that while you as an artist may be zoomed in
the readers
won't be so make
the speech bubbles big look at how other comic artists online do
their speech bubbles for size ideas
and what works best for your own pages as well as test on the site and make sure they look fine
nothing is more frustrating than reading
a comic and the speech bubbles are completely illegible
hello there tablet
yes yes i got this
absolutely gorgeous tablet sent by artysm
it is the m0610 pro graphics tablet it is 10 by 6 inches
it's really really pretty honestly and one of the things that i really like about
it is the portability of it
i use a pretty big graphics
tablet or display tablet rather
it has 8192 levels of pen pressure
the tablet comes with eight express keys and a little style
which honestly is just the cutest little thing
it also ready for this
it's compatible with android so you can plug it in to your phone and other stuff huh
i think it's i think it's really cute
and it's just it's just really pretty
i think that this tablet is honestly fantastic for you guys
that are new to art and i have a ton of young beginner artists
that are like yo pax
where do i get a tablet
what do i do here you go
it's it's on sale
it's beautiful it's stunning and i highly recommend it the company that sent me
this tablet has been ever so patient with me because as a lot of you guys know
i was recently in the hospital so i couldn't get this video out as fast as i wanted to
and you know yada yada so
i'm extremely grateful for this company for being so wonderfully patient with me
thank you so much
i highly recommend this tablet
i don't believe it works on iphones
they might be working on that but it does work on
mac os systems as well as windows systems
but i don't believe it works on iphones from what i can see and i use an iphone and it
it didn't like me so i'm assuming it's just because of the the cord and the port
so maybe they can work on that
but i don't know but that's fine by me because i use just computers
thank you so much to artificial for sending me this absolutely stunning tablet again
please check it out
just talk about tablets all the time
hey hey it's time to thank my patreons
and berry onyx
thank you guys so much
you guys have been so patient with me
hello oh my gosh hi emma
you're new here
you're so sweet
we got our wonderful little blue moon
tees y'all are so cute
hi and for my
what is this a hundred dollar tier the galaxy
t noah
i i can't i yo yo what
you're so you're so kind to me
i can't i thank you so much
holy crap
last month was wild
it was a wild month for me so again
thank you for your patience and i hope you like the video and hey remember drink some water
i'll see you later
hello Android users great news see
2 gigs of ram 16 gigs of ROM
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth there's also an expandable SD slot up to 64 gigs now
and they're all sub $100 tablet
so these are pretty much the cheapest tablet you can get
let's take a look unbox it and see what you get
here's the unboxing
there's absolutely nothing on the outside of the box to identify it
you have to look at the sticker on the outside plastic to find out its CM 63
it doesn't tell you any specs of the actual tablet which is a little worrisome
it's totally plain so super generic a lot of different configurations of this tablet
let's find out what's inside inside the box
we find a little foam
the tablet wrapped up in a lot of plastic
we'll peel that off a little later
underneath we find the various adapters
now this one came with
I guess a European adapter which is no good for me in North America
you can read it it's in English
it's somewhat understandable
yeah not bad
my tablet actually arrived cracked in the bottom
right hand corner it was actually kind of cracked open
I was able to just kind of snap it back into place
so it's a little thing to be noted now it has a crappy camera on the back of the front
there's dual speakers which are okay not very loud
SD card all pretty generic
let's turn it on the first time you boot your tablet up you'll need to login to the
Play Store and your email on all that
I've already got mine all set up in case you're wondering I'm using the go launcher
e^x a custom launcher that
lets me change the appearance of my tablet and it lets me add these little
Doc's on the side make folders
I've even got it
a widget
it's quite handy to have now
we're just gonna check out these settings go from the top right and swipe down
then click on settings you'll note that
I'm actually using a Bluetooth controller here because I've got it set up
scroll all the way down
go to about tablet and here we can find all these specific information now
the tablet model number is actually called a V 11
that's the name of the tablet
it's a quad-core a 33 processor
Android 4.4.2 2.0
firmware 3.4 kernel and the ROM build is called a star
another good feature of this tablet
is that it comes with the
Play Store by default
don't come with it
you need to add it on later or use a third-party market kind of app
so it's great to have it actually come with it now
I compared this directly to other devices
that's a very low-end tablet but it has decent performance for basic productivity
this tablet has a terrible painful to look at screen
YouTube videos with friends or try to show people things on this tablet
it looks pretty bad
it really ruins the experience with the washed out kind of blurry picture
you're gonna see the poor screen
quality is definitely the biggest downside to the tablet
and you'll feel like zombies
ate your brains too now to go over the final stats of the device
I mentioned only come with one gigs
you'll notice here that the system storage and internal storage are separate locations
so that's gonna run out eventually
you're gonna find that you can't install any more apps or you won't be able to update apps
I already ran into a problem
where a clash of clans wasn't able to update because this ran out of space
so basically you'll have to uninstall some apps
it can be a bit of a problem now
there's no way really to fix this
they'll need to update the ROM so that it is a date of media ROM on other devices
you'll see that these system storage in the internal storage
are this same now
the tablet comes with the all winner a 33 quad-core processor a 32-bit processor
some unscrupulous sellers have said that it goes over that but it does not so
we're going to look at the battery capacity and health with a handy app
battery monitor widget in the listing for this tablet is that the battery capacity should be 6500
you may want to contact the seller before purchasing and has to see a screenshot with an app
the deep sleep rating is around minus 30
ma which is half decent
I'd say average for a tablet a really good well supported tablet like the HP touch
my book get down as low as minus 6 with random spiking during daily use
scroll down and look for the security tab
click on the security tab and scroll down till you find unknown sources
the next step we're gonna go to the
Play Store and use the Dolphin Browser
I highly recommend getting this browser
it's one of the best
Android browsers around
you're just gonna download an apk file and install it and it works like that
everything's in the video's description
of course just look down there
I'm going to download it directly to the device now to see notifications
we swipe down from the left hand side
that's where our notification for the download will be coming up
I've already downloaded it once
there doesn't take that long and I'll load it up
once the app starts for the first time
it says root access is unavailable currently but there is a root strategy available
so just try it
so now we're gonna click try to root and just wait for the counter to get to a hundred percent now
I've reached a hundred percent successfully
and we've been routed
now we go to the main
King root app page and under root authorization
we can see a list of all the apps we're going to authorize with root permissions here
we are in root checker
it'll pop up this little menu here and ask you to allow or deny the app the root permissions
or in this case we're gonna allow it
click allow and there we go
we verified our root status is functioning properly
the device is now rooted for any rooted apps
you want to try out enjoy it
you have any trouble with this particular
the performance level of this device is best compared to 1st generation tablets
I'd rate this tablet two and a half out of five stars
the user experience was ok that the screen was unacceptable
and you may get stuck with a lesser device than what you paid for
thanks for watching everybody you
I've always had a thing for Disney stickers and I love that they package them with this tablet
so you can take these stickers and you can sticker up the back of your tablet or on the side or as
I've done here
you can put a sticker on your headphones for me
this kind of tablets
this one specifically actually solves a lot of issues right out of the gate for me with tablets
it's always gone because a kid always has my tablet
there's also things on my tablet that
I don't want my son to access my ten-year-old son
the first thing you're gonna see are these books
these are the 25 pre-loaded Disney books when my kids were learning to read
they loved these books especially in kindergarten grade
one they're amazing books so we went and took a tour of the mall
you can either have the tablet read to you
you can have it autoplay or you can read to yourself
it also comes with different apps that are specifically for kids so
I don't let my ten-year-old watch standard YouTube
I make him watch YouTube for kids when he does access YouTube
so that's on this tablet
there's lots of great choices
there's also
Disney now loaded in this tablet so you can click on that and you can access Disney now account
I've never really used Disney now
I love all things
so you know it's just taking pictures for fun and that kind of thing if they'd like to use that so
they do expand slightly
I can
he can only download certain apps so
I can control what he's viewing
I have not broken the tablet
my son has so just by dropping the force of dropping it it will catch an edge and all of a sudden
your tablet is smashed with this tablet
that doesn't happen
it has a very bouncy ball case
I mean I'm not even concerned about dropping it
I would drop in on the floor
the only thing I think I would change about
obviously it's not going to turn on
the noise limiting headphones
I find are a very useful feature
I had a child in kindergarten or a grade one
I would definitely bring home
this tablet the Disney pre-loaded content alone
I think is completely worth it
those are great books that they have in there
a few of my favorites have been in there that my kids read and the durability of this tablet
you're not going to break this
there's just no way so having it prepackaged in this shell
it's like a foam shell
it's always hard to do that
push and pull with your tablet but when they have a tablet that's all their own
Disney air book
you can see my full written review of this cool tablet on
Best Buy canada's blog
thanks for watching
hello everybody gets past syllable and um
I'm a little upset usually when I'm drawing
it obviously works from the footage that you're seeing which is the tablet that I'm using
it definitely works but it has a lot of problems
the tablet that I'm using is a helium 420
I don't know the actual pronunciation of it
I'll have the name the title and probably on the screen but it has a ton of issues now
this probably isn't an issue for some people but it definitely was for me
it's very very very small
it's only a little bit bigger than my trackpad on my laptop if that is a good comparison
the thing about this is
the battery in is really flimsy
and so my pen is constantly falling apart
my third complaint is the wire
the wire itself is fine
it's an okay length but it's unresponsive
you're listening to actually comes through into your headphones
sometimes my fourth complaint is and
my computer completely restarted it and it was it was gone but then
I used sigh and maybe I worded it wrong
I've gotten a couple of really good drawings out of it
it does work
maybe but if you're looking for a tablet that you use often don't buy this one
don't buy this anyway
this is pastel opal
I hope your days have been better than mine
see you later pebbles
hi there
I've got a quick opportunity to show you this
Windows 8 tablet from Fujitsu
it's called the q5 7/2 and it's it's a stylistic series tablet much like the
Q 702 that I've shown you recently
but this one is a 10-inch version it's a it's a smaller tablet than the 11.6 inch to 702
but it looks as you can see very very similar to the Q 702
it's got a very similar sort of looking design about it in the typical
it's got a 1366 by 768 display resolution
same as the Q 702 and it has and the Q 572 has very similar screen brightness
but you can see that
we've got a great viewing angle which is really essential for tablets now
is that the
Q 572 actually has a removable battery
which is pretty amazing for a tablet that is very lightweight in fact the
Q 572 only weighs 730 grams
do that's around about the same weight as an iPad for example but having a removable battery
I should say about the Q 572
this tablet is clear targeted at business users at corporate
rollouts it's not tire that consumers like an iPad or a galaxy or something like that
on-site warranty which is quite unique for a tablet device
but the thing that makes that on-site warranty actually possible is the fact that you can see here
there's a couple of little lugs there that
HP that I've got here
the screens are actually glued together
and they're not really serviceable at all
there's no as you can see on the back of this
HP elite pad here
there's no way to actually open this machine up and in fact often times
it's ooh technician can actually come out and open up the tablet and make repairs in the field
there's actually a smart card reader here
so if you had a smart card or a single sign-on authentication device
one more connection just to point out here is the the docking connector on the bottom
here there is a standalone desktop
we've got a webcam and on the back
you'll see that this tablet here is
it's running 2 gigabytes but we can actually run up to 4 gigabytes of RAM in this tablet
we're also running a 64-bit operating system which is a really brilliant feature
a lot of corporates have gone with a 64-bit SOE deployment for Windows 7 and Windows 8
this tablet does support
Windows 7 as well as Windows 8
72 is the fan that it doesn't need to run to keep that processor cool
it's a little bit noisy but I guess most applications for this tablet are not going to be in
Landrum's this is not the kind of tablet that you'd buy to surf the the net on your couch
this is a tablet
Fujitsu 2 button pen that has a finer tip or another example of that
is this sony
of course the tablet has the standard Windows 8 handwriting recognition capability
but as you can see it does really well
and there's very little lag there in using the pen and it works really well so the
Q 572 is really designed for corporate tablet deployment
kind of place that you might expect to see
this is in a hospital and a local council or a government agency with staffer out in the field
low-cost form factor
the Wacom cth 470
if you're an artist or an avid osoo player you probably heard of the bamboo tablets
but what do you know about them
bamboo cth 470 is a third-generation
Bamboo tablet meaning
they don't produce them anymore
there's a newer version of the
Wacom tablets you can pick these up on Amazon
usually used in rare cases there are new ones
that haven't been out of the box but they usually go for around two times the regular price
alright let's talk about the hardware
the bamboo usually responds quickly
whenever using the pen or touch input however if you leave
Microsoft ink on
there's a chance you will lag
but that's because of Microsoft
the pen has two buttons on it
click whenever you press something
let's talk about the software usually when you buy these off of Amazon
you can change how the pen tip feels
you can change tracking modes you can enable click
sounds or turn them off
you can change the double-click lengths
Express keys and have various purposes like opening the bamboo dock or switching pages
the smooth surface is where you use your pen
it has a 5.8 inch by three point
what's up buddy
oh gee what do you need
larger pens and the pen is 6 inches
long it features wireless capability but you will need a battery which
I did not have one with mine in total
alright everyone thanks for watching
make sure to subscribe so you can see the next time
I upload a video and sneak
peek it's going to be about this tripod thing
way to go
barb um good job stupid walking on our shelf let's see what
Bartholomew has for us today
okay we have the bamboo create pin and touch tablet
some fellow that let's check it out
okay so here's the box it comes in and here's what comes in that
here's the drawing pin along with some accessories
and there you have it all out of the box now
let's start with the pin
those don't come with
I just put those in there a second ago
it comes with three pin tips and a little removable while tool to help you remove the pin tips
I'm going to show you how that works right here
and yes you will go to pen tips
Amazon as well and to replace the pen tip just simply sticking them with your hand
you don't need the tool for this part okay
the overall size of this tablet is just about 13 inches by 8 inches and the active size
that's the part that you actually draw in
it also has an attached pin holder on the side to put your pin
and it's also an upgradeable wireless kit so that you don't have to use this
USB cable that's included which is very short and I do recommend get any Wireless can
I don't have it right now but I do recommend Ginter you can get it on Amazon
also you can go to the
Wacom site to get that also and as far as pressure goes
this thing has 1024 levels of pressure and not to mention this thing works perfectly for both
Windows or Mac
now you first setup you got an Internet install and CD which did not work right at all
I waited for like five minutes
install it and it said oops
I'm told is supposed to have like a paper like feel that I guess you can say that's sort of true
sure no pen goes perfect with that texture
so let's have a good texture to it
does it feel like paper
I I will say that but doesn't fly plastic either so now the area that my hand is outlining now
that's the actual drawing area now
here is the programmable
I like what this tablet also
that's when you get action actual drawing on the screen
now you might be asking
I have a mouse
I have Photoshop and all that why would I want to buy this product
you just click and drag
and that's pretty much how you draw or design things with this
there's different programs you can use and it's punch levels of sensitivity as you can see
I'm doing right here by the way
my drawing sucks
I'm horrible at this
I am learning jessica's a lot better at this than I am but as you can see
I'm drawing lines
I'm pressing down alright
I mean I will draw for you
here's here's one thing though but I could've done this with a mouse again
this thing is just a trackpad to count like apples
trackpad is kind of like a touch pad
Mouse to do all your normal functions on so overall I really like this drawing peg
I mean that's pretty much it only only thing
it's very short
but that's for interview of the bamboo pin and touch create tablet
thanks for watching starting at the top it says
Diamond tears and it also has a very nice rubbery grip material onto the side we have a trance
so how does
Windows 10 look on tablets
Start screen has a or your Start button has expanded out and you now have this kind of like
Start screen all around now
you know the whole thing there you can see all your different applications that are on your
Start menu but if you tap on the top left hand corner it gives you everything that's on your
you can also look at your application list
and that's of course the power button
now that's your back button that is of course
Cortana and that is the next button
there is your task view
if you will now the one thing you notice
is that at the bottom
there is really nothing all those icons
I had that were pin there
that kind of disappeared
now you can also go in the action
Notification Center to actually switch between tablet mode
so which means
I can quickly access applications
I use all the time like you know
Chrome for instance here or I can open up you know
applications for instance like powerpoints that will jump into the other screen area and if
I open up another application again and I'll go back to the original one then
I can now decide how I want to multitask
it's a fluid process and it works
well one of the things
well it's something that you just have to take some time to look at and it'll be easy to use
you can see using the task view
a lot of people will find useful in just use case scenario but this is on a 13.3 inch device
this is tablet mode
you can see there
you can still pin all the applications
you were running on there now with this
I have a full desktop
look again so I can
I can switch between either the two even on a 7-inch tablet again
so that's one thing
I wish i I was there so right there in the center but easy to quickly
just snap your keyboard back and switch back to desktop mode so any questions guys
let me know otherwise
hey guys welcome back to my channel in this video
I'm going to review the legally pac-10 which is an entry-level Android tablet
with a 10 inch display
the seller also gave a free gift a cheap headphone here
it's probably the best deal around at the moment
so let's take a look at the box of the LeapPad 10
it's pretty impressive for a entry-level product
so here is the tablet itself
yeah for a entry level tablet
yeah and yeah it does feel pretty well built this
okay right here we have
I believe this is a QuickStart guide or something and this is a warranty certificate over
here is the free belief
I don't know what it called
is this free free stand or something
free protect protector
I believe these are hit things earphones
so yeah so yeah a bunch of cheap earphones
I'm seeing some bubbles
the viewing angles are great
it's very clear
this tablet is pretty loud
they are and in fact
I think these are the loudest speakers that I've had on any smart device
I feel especially the louder
you go the more distortion there is so now
I'm gonna play a bunch of funny people videos just to give an idea what the speakers sound like
distortion is a problem
I noticed that sometimes
so let's see what what scores is getting okay
I can feel that when I when I'm scrolling in-between between apps or I'm multitasking
something some apps in the background it actually actually produces choppy video on YouTube
so that's basically what you expect from a entry level tablet that being said this is a tablet
that's great for people who want to do simple stuff like media consumption watching YouTube videos
you know surfing websites and checking their Facebook and yeah
it's basically made for a simple task
it's reasonably good
not exactly very good in low light but still just good enough to capture some details
okay so right now
I'm doing a video test using the legal pad 10 and as you can see here
the video quality is what you'd expect from an entry level tablet
it's not that bad
it's not as good as the mid-range smartphones that
the output is reasonably good
the leap pattern has a double
SIM card slot slots at the back and single single memory card slot
I believe
let me show you what it looks like so to open the slot
you just need to pry open this plastic cover here
that's a single
and this one's for the memory card so overall as an entry level tablet this
LeapPad 10 doesn't disappoint
there are some weaknesses here and there some flaws but overall
I would recommend this
I would say so
that concludes my review of the illegally pad 10
I hope you found is really useful and please hit the like button
if you've enjoyed it please subscribe to my channel for more future videos and till the next video
I'll see you again good bye
hey everybody is lying
Seidman we've got not one but two new 8-inch tablets from Amazon to check out today
this is the new
Fire HD 8 and we got in the HD 8 and the HD 8 plus and
all the opinions you're about to hear are my own
nobody is paying for this review
nor is anyone reviewing or approving
what you're about to see before it was uploaded
so let's get into it now and see what these tablets are all about now
the price point on these is very reasonable the HD 8 here sells for $89
we're going to start with what these two tablets have in common
they both have an 8-inch display
it's a 1280 by 800 display
IPS nice and bright
they also both have the same exact processor an MT 8 1 6 8
that's a 64-bit processor to get a little techie
here on you
Amazon change their mind in the future
that was nice
if you want and they can accept cards up to one terabyte they both support
AC wireless to get on your Wi-Fi and all together really nice little tablets here
or whatever you're gonna be fine with the lower-priced 2 gig model
Qi like I do here
if you place
the tablet down on the center of it it will most of the time begin charging itself
I'm finding it's hard sometimes to get the center
point exactly dialed in there
but once you get it placed there you can see that it started charging itself
there is an accessory item that
not all that heavy
I like the size
industrial design leads you to believe
surprisingly this has stereo speakers on it so if you are watching content that has stereo to it
you'll hear it out of both audio quality isn't spectacular
but it's better than you might think on a low cost tablet
it's certainly a lot better than some of the generic tablets that I've looked at my one
I tend to do my web conferences with my devices in portrait orientation
which is how my phone is configured
and how prior versions of this tablet were configured but the camera is not going to be here
it's going to be here
the device will of course work in either orientation but just note
your power button is here
you've got a volume rocker here
and you've got a headphone jack and again
this is common to both of the tablets that Amazon is offering in this HD 8 line
then you've got another camera here on the back
both cameras are 2 megapixels not spectacular image quality
Awards with it and finally the SD card slot here is on the side
they have it protected underneath this little door here
you might see that
so the most obvious one is the one you'll see on the lock screen so you can see here
it's got an ad for subscription boxes when I unlocked a tablet and lock it again
we might see a different ad popping up here
let's take a look now at performance
we'll step through a few different things that I tested with these
they're 10 inch tablet is still the best performing
Amazon tablet that they have in their lineup
that one costs a little bit
I think you can get two of these for what one of those Samsung tablets costs so
that's a pretty good deal
I think and for games and stuff
this will do just fine
this is the mobile version of Minecraft running on the low-end HD 8 device
here as you can see it seems to be performing quite nicely
let me show you where the added
RAM might make a difference
let's go to the main menu and load up maybe
perhaps let's get into it here on the HD 8 at the bottom
so here you go
we might see that load screen pop up briefly
it didn't bring us back to the main menu
I'm back in the world that I was playing the Sun is setting now but on this one
I've got to start over again with my game because there wasn't enough
RAM to keep both apps running in the background
and that's the big difference having three gigs versus two gigs
might bring you here
we can jump into the web browser and maybe go to the nasa.gov home page here
real quick performance is not spectacular but it is good enough
I think for getting basic web browsing done it does support
AC wireless so you will be able to take advantage of faster wireless networks and I found
it's pretty easy to again
read text on here and as you can see
I don't expect much of a difference between the two gig and the three gig model for web browsing
I checked out one of Alex
Lindsay's office our webinars that he runs in zoom
every morning he's a big-time video production
guy he had about 40 different participants in that zoom call and the tablet handled it
just fine the audio was good
the video seemed to work
well you just have to deal of course with an 8-inch screen as you're watching it
all work well on here as well
it supports the l1 level for DRM the Widevine DRM so that was good and altogether
I think for media and web browsing for what it is
it's pretty good actually and it might exceed your expectations given the price point now
Store you get the Amazon App Store and a lot of the same apps and games are in the Amazon App
either because again it doesn't have those official
Google apps now
there are ways to get the official google apps on your Amazon tablet
we're going to explore that in an upcoming video
even when they are in standby mode
this was a feature that was in the prior
now she's responding
I'm getting a visual representation of that response
that wasn't available at the time
I was shooting this video
this works though with our other charger here
so if you have the tablet in landscape orientation like so and you place it
down on that wireless charger
we're going to put it back down on the charging pad here again
I was recording this video
they both will perform about the same as you saw but again
I think there's some interesting use cases for the plus addition of these Amazon tablets
let me know what you thought down in the comments below and until next time this is LAN and Simon

this spam looks very similar the established one and liking across the same stuff
yeah this looks a little different though
all we have some spare lips if you had a dragon kind but I was wondering since this
this thing is kind of like bubbly and can you exact on it
some of us are drag players like myself
many people would be like oh man
I didn't need this new tablet
oh man oh man
I can't wait to play with this and they suddenly realize they cannot drag with it
well you know what you can you can drag with it
it acts almost the same as any other tablet
it has a solid surface
and and yes
it's it's guaranteed 300
BPM streaming skill if you had a 500 K play around you are looking for the tablet then
I think this tablet is made for you
I mean its budget its $40 links in the description
so it's pretty good until about a tablet
I haven't tested it out but I should
well let's look inside manual whoo
yeah we have all these information here
the idea is pretty unique
I think it's made for us
because because the resolution is is much like the playfield
yeah let's let's let's look inside this
let's see what we have here
what what is this
your mother's piece of goddamnit piece of burn you burn
yes yes yes oh so good
mmm yes burn
oh yes we have a new
SB cuddle cable
some kind of interesting shape
I mean it's it's like mutt anyway
it is what USB cable looks like this and you can you can plug inside
what can you put oh
I found it
yes you can plug inside here
oh that's really neat
oh we have a battery as well stylus pen look but Pat has all these information on it
you can probably not read because my camera isn't that were all now
you can eat it as we have some pen nibs
that's very important
if you are drag player like me new clip he'll need grip well
a laptop isn't coming with it
nowadays you just download it from the internet from YouTube
yeah subscribe to go to
there is a manual
how to assemble and disassemble the pan
mmm what a good and let's try this out so

I'll pay all these things with the table
I couldn't pick a mouse
you can't even play this game it up with the mouse you can only try this
carry the table only table
yeah it's not working this
I haven't played with this tablet for like 10 minutes and I can already do this
this tablet is the key to being a pro
look at this rhythm skill
what you cannot have it with this tablet
yes hmm oh look at this
look how fast
I am hmm no other tablets can do this well in conclusion
it has specifications
I honestly don't know what these things mean so you have to be the judge
I think people who are getting into this game and would like a cheap tablet
I think this this would be a pretty good choice for them
the price is okay
and and pennies okay
I did this tablet
let's see maybe not 800 PP
but let's say 715
BB yes
I think I'm going to give this tablet 715 PP out of time
so thank you for watching and hope you liked it and yes
I'm a sellout deal with it
hello guys and welcome back to my channel

Pro 13 and it is a graphics tablet lady and Rara but it has a screen on it
I am so freaking excited to try this out
use them at the moment
I isn't a super old Wacom Intuos and it doesn't have a screen
I'm looking at my screen
the canvas pro is 400 the 400-pound mark on Google Shopping so 400 to 500
this also wants for 300 so it's considerably considerably cheaper
I think we're talking 200 300 pound here first impressions of the box and everything is

so this is how it's packaged
so it's copy
this is in download driver
then what's this interesting pin display
it's a very nice quality so hot how do I open this
can you see
we've got a stand
obviously we've got the tablet
I can't wait to try this out
this is my
Wacom pen as you can see
the style is very very similar
and then obviously got the plug adapters stand and all the bits to plug in so
I like how sturdy that is so
Sophia confirmed this hitch
here my lead is for your monitor
basically but because I have an a Mac I need a lightning cable
because max like to be funny and have all their products in one so
tomorrow what a nightmare
I ordered the wrong adapter
I needed the USB to see
hitch here on cable and I just ordered this of Amazon
the first one they ordered arrived five days later and it was the wrong connection
I'd ordered the lightning bolt one instead of the thunderbolt connection
Oh wiser so what just double-check that that's a little something you can bear in mind
I finally got it working
the screen is on so we can finally get in today's review video
it's been a long time coin
so let's check you out actually haven't tried it at all so I've plugged in
it's turned on
let's see if it works shall we so
I'll so I'm here
we are ready to go
I've plugged it in and I'm used to using the 27-inch mac screen which is a 4k
I've kept it set up to the 27 inch display
you don't have this
it's a solid like pen
I'm gonna offer a new layer one thing I have noticed already is compared to my Wacom
it's not as jittery so my
I couldn't do really nice smooth lines and I've noticed already
oh that this is very smooth
oh my goodness now
I can't draw straight lines anyway
so this seems oh very smooth
I tell you what we should probably test out the pen sensitivity the pressure sensitivity should
I say by going into this one
I'm just going to increase the pen size
so what if
I don't know what does I do
wah all right
okay you are
I'm kind of like leave it
do you follow them
that kind of works the best
I really like that so far the pressure sensitivity
it's very very nice like it
it's my screen display black nose
look off and double-check
it doesn't give me a brightness option so I think this is the brightness
see how you get with it and obviously
I'm guessing it I'm gonna put B and see if that works
yeah you works so now
I can just click this for my pen
I can click this button and it'll open my brush
let's see if this works so
I have set it off which is obviously undo
this is the undo
this should undo my stuff
no it didn't work
ah it's because
I put the wrong come under my dad
so it's clear string again no it's optional and Jose okay apply
this should work this time yay so
I can literally just work like this one day
undo undo undo these are really really handy haven't shot cuts like these oops clear string
E and you can put the Kommandant or whatever you use
I'll have set up as your Sharp keys for Photoshop
you can put them in to this
which is really really good but these are the ones that
I've got my hotkeys sorted out
I'm going to sketch something okay so I finished doing that
little doodle giving human tablet a little tryout and and
I like to work on a big screen my tablet that I use for the iPad is a 12 inch screen
so it's the same size screen but it's not running for shot on it at
Photoshop has a lot of tools and accessories around
then it might be the tablet for you
secondly don't expect the display to be like the 4k Retina display because it is not
obviously it's not gonna be as good as my 4k 27-inch
so do your research on that
I'm not clued off of our stuff like that
why am i doing a review video then
Pro is that the pen is beautiful
I can't fault the pen at all
I really like the ship
it's really nice quality
it feels expensive
it doesn't feel cheap
I like the nib
and it's nice that the buttons are here
it's very handy for just clicking backwards and forwards and setting up your pen
I also like the way
I really really liked that
I liked that I have no complaints about it
it is slightly lukewarm at the top of my tablet and
I haven't used it for very long
it's been on for around about hours so that's not too bad but heavy use
I can't say how hot it's gonna get Booker
is this little door not pen
hold the door not saying that
yeah it's very nice quality and it looks cute
put your pen in so
I like that as well
it does the trick
and if it's your first graphics tablet and you're looking at what to get this might be for you
you can't run full version Photoshop
at least you couldn't until the new
however much it is
there's another 100 on top of your already expensive purchase
so if you're not sure what to get
I mean on a budget that might be something to consider is
is my price point this all this and also do you want to be able to run full version
Photoshop but you have to plug it into your computer
then the human might be for you if you find of having
it always mounted computer
obviously this human is not portable in terms of
the human stats for a 300 to 400 pound so not too bad
I hope this reveal review video was ok and I covered as much ground as I could
I'm not used to doing a review video so bear with me
its way out
it's a definite improvement from my old
Wacom Intuos and the fact that can draw on the screen whilst it's plugged into my computer
it's very nice so I will actually continue using this graphics tablet
I hope this was helpful to you all
thank you so so much for watching
thank you and for gifting me
this tablet it means the world and and I will see you in the next video
I love you so so much guys
hope you enjoy it
alright then love you bye
it has a um a windows
hello camera um windows
hello infrared camera as part of the webcam here
and that's uh that's actually working uh has been working quite well
it has a little red flashing light
hello camera the other thing that i just wanted to mention
is that um all of the usbc points
as i pointed out earlier are actually on the on the on the right side here all three of them
there's only three
the charger plugged in as well
so if i had to describe this tablet in a few words
so the chances are you're probably going to end up going directly to the remarkable website
the stock varies from time to time
so keep an eye on the website and i'll leave a link to that in the description below now
the company are really not messing about when it comes to the tablet itself
it has a fantastic performance in terms of the pen to surface movement
and it's quick to notice a change in the pressure when i'm shading or writing
i never thought i'd say this but the battery life on this thing is insane at one point
it has a usb a to a micro usb to charge the tablet
unfortunately it's not what i want
i'd prefer it to be a usbc but we can't please everybody
the tablet does have security features such as a pin to log in but this alone has some issues
and of course if you make a mistake there is also an eraser on there too
but it doesn't just stop there
this one has seven gigabytes
there's hundreds of templates on there for you to use
then why not subscribe
take care and i'll see in the next one
I'm cleaning
we have a product to review a sim bans
I have no idea
we haven't even unboxed it yet so stick around and we'll get right into it okay
I know you guys are out there
some of you just want in the bottom line
it'll jump you right to the conclusion otherwise stick around
let's take a look at this
I have literally not open
this box have not seen this
they sent me one would
I take a look at it and do a video
I said sure send it along
firstly it does come with a UK
and your plug in adapters
you will need to use batteries with the pun
it uses quadruple a batteries
well it really makes a stand out from the crowd especially at its price
point is that it has pressure sensitivity on its screen not touch sensitivity
select my Wacom Bamboo tab that's what I usually draw with here on my computer and on my channel
and that's what you're getting from this also tab as well now
I think that would be even better but I also have an iPad pro that I draw on and comparatively
you can see that size difference there
I love this screen
I took some pictures with it and it is not great quality
I'm gonna be honest
the resolution wasn't as high as you want
it doesn't uphold detail very well in low-light situations you're not buying it for the camera
somebody's wedding or like your kids
birthday party just get a better camera
if you do that then the line goes where you would expect now
ideally it would work exactly the same in any orientation that's the way my
it's a little too much up up right
you're likely gonna just have it on your lap or lay it on the table flat anyway
so it's not a big loss there anyway
aside from that the computational power does have its limits again proper expectations
it doesn't have as much power as say the iPad pro
I used the pencil tool here
so are you gonna use this for your final professional images
like you know the oil paint brushes
or if you want to just you're on the road you want to travel you know
somebody's driving you're just sitting there
are you gonna sketch away
I do like I believe
it's fake leather
the cameras got a cutout for that as well
the little elastic band is excellent for keeping your pin in there so
it's going to do that for you
yeah my pad pros better it
does everything better essentially than this does
also let me know if you pick it up and what your thoughts about it was and until
I see you next time keep drawing
hello everyone my name is welcome
welcome to this
another episode of low cost graphic tablet review unbox first experience
i don't know how to upgrade
anyways i'm unboxing foreign um driver please
can you hear foreign so yeah
that's a good thing
also the working surface data
trust me foreign by the way
what do i think about this last time
the graphics terminator review
i would give it like till then
gasps you love from people you trust
this is tweet finally
let's wrap things up with our very own producer
no that's not what
is the budget tablet owner
so they wanted to break into that market with this guy
which is the budget awright
yes it's definitely budget
it's only 129
a1000 costs more
cuz we have more r a minute or exactly
yeah so it has some a few better interiors
it comes with a dual core cortex a9 MCU chip and you can definitely see that excess
you get a little bit faster prom
yeah yeah that takes
I think that's partly Android a lot of Android devices are like that huh
little sluggish yeah
it also has a 1 gig of ram 16 gigs internal memory
it also has 32 gigs at external microSD card slot on the side
so you can't increase that memory size of 16 gigs isn't enough and then
I of course has the volume ports on the side
I have the power button up at the top with the audio jack next to it
I often do that if I listen for a long time yeah
I never did that myself
so didn't become a problem for me now
one interesting thing about the micro
I believe that equals out to 12 ounces exactly and it also has a really decent battery
I wouldn't say it's great
it only lasts about six to eight hours of battery life
BGN Wi-Fi now one thing that I did want to focus on is they
they have adobe audio and two different speakers on here
so you get dual audio
it's an atlas
I'm good so if I pull up my browser it's awfully two different videos
just a couple of short seconds on here
I have Radford's review of the 925
I'll turn this up for you
it's nice and clear it gets loud too
it's pretty decent
sounds good i mean you can
i can't tell it home but it sounds pretty good
yeah exactly yeah and then if i pull up a different video i'll pause this
i could do it for audiobooks
it would be fine for watching youtube videos
yeah yeah now if we listen to you some music for example this is a little bit different
you'll notice a change
I gotta skip this out
I hate it when ads karaokeing oh I am totally careful
that sounds good
that sounded pretty
good that actually so
I'll play some music that we won't get taken
there's no babe my friend
Dale chase there is no bass
yeah and that's a big drawback of this while it does get loud
and it's very clear and crisp
it does not get you that in my space like I as a speakers for example price
so that's definitely a drawback and something that would probably keep me from purchasing it
it's also now considered a little bit old because it has 4.1 jelly bean instead of 4.3
which was just released recently
even though this is brand new this just came out a couple weeks ago
so it's pretty brand-new well
you're thinking to have a lighter
version of jelly before 22 is pretty common
yeah yeah 4.2 is really nice but 4.1
so definitely a little old
I'll save the display for last
I did want to mention on the front facing camera
right here
you get this little camera
I'll pull up some pictures that I took
they actually don't look that great
so here's a couple of pictures
I took earlier today and some I took a five megapixels eight
it is 0 point three megapixel
that's the front facing front facing
there's no bad camera
Oh greenie it's very hard to get any photos and low point for skyping
I guess or definitely is yeah
you can't really get any good photos out of this with just a front facing camera now
Oh deke also no physical buttons on there for a home button
it's all know so when it freezes now again okay
okay froze there
you go happens quite a bit
so it's okay
I don't think you need to go much further
the display is 1024 x 600
ooh the resolution is really really low
yeah and on this 7-inch device on in this day and age
I would expect a much better resolution because the pixel does it's just terrible
cuz you're not gonna use it spend 229 bucks get a nexus 7
yeah 80 bucks
Morgan Ewing angles even turning 20
Yeah right leo
yeah right it
just holy kiss
you can outdated software a really bad camera on that
no we're cameras facing
take a look at that
it almost gave me a slight headache because of the resolution range looking
it's not super hot
yeah yeah so it was just
I really didn't like that
I hate it when companies put bloatware on there the cons of course the terrible screen
yeah screens horrible
yeah which is so too bad no by trying so
I bet you can guess hmm hmm even in half the price probably don't buy it
yeah even at half the price i would give it a
don't buy i would say you know
cash out the little bit of extra money for a nexus 7 or even
the asus has a 7-inch tablet which is the same price
we still like those
Nexus haven't quite a bit
i think that there are good choices out there
i think in this case lenovo should stick to laptops and it baffles me that
Dolby puts his name on something
that sounds that bad
I mean really Dobie come on all right
Thank You Shannon Morse produces before you buy
also you'll see her all the time on a lot of our shows really appreciate it
you'll be playing poker tonight on
Friday oh I will will you
I don't yes Shelly you play poker didn't win some money over the weekend in Vegas
well there you go you better watch out
Padre so our resident priest is holding a poker game on Friday night
make sure you tune in
Shannon will be taking the pot
Thank You Shannon
but you can't right now you could take that Lenovo away
I'm not being biased
cuz it is my first one so like it'd probably be more harsh in it because my first one so
okay she's kidding
I like it but you know you know time will only tell so
this is my review right now
so here it is
we're top of cons verse and the only like combat
I think you guys will be slightly slightly aware of is depending on
if you're like really gonna move this tablet is that these are not the best they definitely work
they're not cons
I'm calling this claimers number one
so yeah but that's basically it and yeah the pros about this for these cool aspects
I like its Queen simple
it doesn't look like it's worth $30
this would probably be worth $10 blink
it's $30 like this already
looks kind of good so I mean it's not bad it's not bad a lot
you need the Lois
you're getting a tablet form for
oh so anyways
it's like 25 so why not just stitch up after five bucks to get a good one you know or just a gal
Mon or this one
we'll try one
you put that one goes here per four persons but personal preference but pretty bad
you can see the drivers right here
I don't see many problems
there's usually three three means one if your thumb mutters make sure you're on the right
click on it next to the like where all your tops are like right there right there
I have put out already because I already have a video
it's ooh it's gonna be somewhere maybe
I card just check it out
just go to my channel
it's my only game play
hopefully it was good enough in you guys and short enough because the no laughs guess
I'm not very long attention spans
if you guys enjoyed make sure you guys like and subscribe to the channel
please let me get you on discoveries before the before spring break because that is what
I'm gonna be doing something very special guys
don't know check my channel
you know it
was you guys next
one peace out
what's going on everyone
my name is aaron
pad sa8 tablet
this is an 8-inch android tablet
i said sure send it over
i'm going to do an honest review of it
so full disclosure this was sent to me is not paid for however and this is my honest opinion on it
if you took away the touch id button
on the bottom it has those larger top and bottom bezels
there's actually nothing so that is just a free side on the top
you have an expandable storage sd card reader
that can read up to 128 gigs of expandable storage
on the bottom you have dual speakers
a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and then a usb type
c port for charging this tablet comes in at 1.12 pounds or 510 grams
is this heavy at all
the screen like i said is eight inch 1920 by 1200 ips display and this is a good display
it gets nice and bright
the colors seem very accurate
text is easy to read
they have this anti-blue light screen that they call it
if you're the type that likes to take pictures with your tablet this will be just fine
the back camera can shoot in 720p
the front-facing camera can only shoot in 480p
the dual speakers on the bottom are pretty good as well
they get pretty loud and they should be loud enough to use in just about any setting
this tablet runs android 10 pi has three gigabytes of ram 32 gigabytes of internal storage again
you can expand that with an sd card
it has an eight core processor that's clocked in at 1.6 gigahertz has bluetooth 4.2
a 4 000 milliamp battery that they quote at 12 hours of usage
actually in comparison to the amazon fire hd eight that i reviewed a couple months ago
this one just feels so much more snappier
multitasking seems a lot
they also seem to open up faster as well
and you're kind of in and out of things quicker overall
it just feels like a little bit better performance on this basking sa8 battery
life has also been really impressive they quote 12 hours
consumption has been really impressive as well
you can game on this and most games play really smoothly
i'm pretty impressed with this fast
king sa8 there are just a few things that i wish were a little bit better
first i kind of wish that they would slim up these front bezels
but i have to say that
this 8 inch tablet is premium
i love the full hd screen
maybe you want to do a little bit of gaming on this
get some more information on it
check out some more reviews
see if it's for you
effective engaging empowering education
yes yes so so yes
let's open agency so foreign itself
what maybe we have
you're very heavy then it moves
i'm gonna
that's the logo i feel like i'm gonna all right so yes
that's it's always look i can see
the tablet is like a sega computer in a way
yes what with the flour
can i see so as you can see
it's powered by android new macbook player
android descent
yes do it all right so this guy one
it takes approximately 25 seconds to pawn
yeah well you can see all the time
the time is like 2024 format we will change that after
okay so so yes as you can see
it's like it's still like a tower because remember it's touch
screen screen is touchable movable and then also the keyboard okay so as you guys can see
it's basically just for school only school
what's this one is only so there's like there's nothing to move around
there's enough straps app store
empty focus app store calculator
calendar chrome drive files
learn book quick settings secure on browser wi-fi manager and youtube youtube youtube
yes so this is all the apps and all that should come with this building
do we really know what's going on there
i'm changing this
so they exited wi-fi manager
you got to see it
set it up
set up the wi-fi so just upload this one or it does sound like that
i'm not properly just checking it so uh so it looks like the like the
the tablet is not updated also so we will first check check update
yes so so
you can get your wi-fi here
yeah so you type in so as you can see we placed in the the wi-fi password password
yes so you can
you can do that also to our channel thank you
it's searching you know
i certainly have exhaustion so we can
he's taking a long while watching
so yeah so
um next thing we're going to do is we're going to go on to youtube
let's see our new youtuber as you can see the processor on the ebook
our learn book is not so fast like like an ordinary computer
so from whatever but it's workable so you can see taking on the load and you can see
also the bar is full
the wi-fi bar is full so hoping there's another wi-fi problem so so for the top
i guess so
we're going to update anything okay
almost normal functional bloom because the screen
so let's let's try the volume here
hold the volume
how the speakers work i also reach
another volume can also subscribe to that channel
so if that's showing on your thing you need to press subscribe
yeah that means to press it
oh yes so
we'll just select any video just here
the the speaker speaker works so let's go ahead and select
yes yes let's do it
there was a problem while playing
we're not sure whether where the speaker is located cause we gonna get today on the side
here let's begin located right here
oh that that one could be for most because it connected to the keyboard
there's a there's another usb compartment here
there's a slot for for like for charger guessing
so this one here is for like a regular blackberry
charter a regular android android charger
yes that's the charging port
yeah this one is this
that's above 300 and i'm not gonna approximately 300 us u.s usd so in ec that will be
i'll just eat something
yeah so that's a lot of money for one little button your personal inspire so we will not do that
we're gonna be doing that today
maybe another day or maybe not
oh yes we're back to the screen
after that we heard all the we heard a volume so you can go view it for yourself
those videos or quick plays on this channel or or is yeah
i can hear more of that song on the channel at ltv production
just click down below all those videos
yes yes so
make sure you guys subscribe so back to the review
there you go so we're gonna go back we're gonna go back back
there's a small back button like android
here yeah back
i am back to the home page
so we're gonna the learn book
yes we're gonna see what's in the loan book so automatically sign it
i don't know if you could
y'all gotta see our process there but please wait
it's not as we say it's not the fastest so it took so long to load
the screen actually went asleep
went to sleep
stop it starting so it exited as you can see no cards
we just cool
or whatever for center loading books please wait
it's doing the same
let's see what all right
so yes so you can see the box load up so whatever subject area you're doing
it will automatically loads up and you choose what subjects you're doing
i'm guessing this is a textbooks like the main textbooks for those classes forms
so i'm gonna see because there's like there's books like like looks like physics
different contents
let's see what we're doing um social interaction so he selects us
it's like that i more using the screen because i wanted to do faster
yes yes it's load up to the book so as you can see as a teacher
yes so it's it's it's like a normal textbook just in here so that feature is very great
i love that feature
yes so so yeah no go back
it's a very futuristic feature from the books that carry on in bag book so yes we signed you know
so it's saying we signed in or our google account or g email gmail
yes so it's the same dream drive from same ordinary drive like it shows your personality first now
it was nothing so thing that you backed up and so yeah so
that's the thing
yes password
yes which is it
so let's see what's what we can do
so you guys can see
facebook.com is blocked so they block facebook
you cannot use facebook
the person who set up this computer has chosen to block this site
this has blocked this feature and block facebook
uh i'm guessing it's all social media
yeah yeah so no
facebook facebook is out of it school purposes
there is not really so much thing that you can access amazon is awesome
there's no there's there's not so much like apps to see so i'm gonna try us
uh i'm gonna try
i'll check good app
a lot of those are blocked
google www.google.com is blocked
yeah all right so we'll try it again
go back we enter chrome and then you can see the giveaway dropping straight
yeah so let's type in something more educational okay
yeah so we'll try
it's not working so we'll try another feature try another so we want to go on app store
i'm still i'll absolutely access for two years
hello all right so there is a messy
i think this is like updates
the app store is consist of updates for like see market
clear data
it's just update the previous app that is built in with the device
so let's turn let's go on ebook run book uh-huh that this thing was cool
we already had
i don't know if the update or so
let's see what will happen
okay people so this is all all that we have for all the apps we review everything we know
it looks very luxurious
it looks it looks very overall
the device feel device feel strong
it feels good not wiki and it comes in a case
i'm doing a nice case to help
protect it device
we ever give it a spin spin
let's see we haven't figured out
what is what those two cameras therefore here and here one here
we don't know if it's for zoom class as well
yeah we don't know if if it will activate doing the zoom classes but there's no zoom
there's no camera setting
are there no zoom anything to access any more apps
oh yeah so oh
the camera could be far for the messy display
oh no yes so we
we don't know as yet what's going on with those i guess later on
this is everything we cover
i'll see everything of the book
so yes i i guess this is all so overall empty
what do you rate it from a one a one to ten scale
well it i read it uh well
it's strictly for educational purposes
only school work
only so it's not like you could access any other thing for school wise
it can still do things
it's still do
the mean what is mean purposes to do
but i don't know why the google not working
that's a big minus because google is a important thing when in school
i need that just research
do your research is anything
you wanna have a a loan book just for just because they can access books in it
you need to use the internet to access things so that yeah yeah so for me
oh well for the whole book
in general i give it a uh a five okay decent
but like as he said the the chrome the google beam block is
what is one of the main throw-offs yes yes because i can
he does a good search engine so yeah so negative five
it's a good
it's a good device
it's a good device
yes yes it's processed
nothing's very slow
no i'll change my retained three to three because the width
it's a break literally a break
two is to be a tree because the two is like a
it's really heavy if you are 50
yeah really heavy
focus here because we don't have the 300 some us
yeah so it's very heavy
yeah yeah see
it's very thick too
the screen is very stick and that's the brick
yeah yeah but it's this little and it looks on the car on the car
i look like like a bullet bulletproof case that he's very
he looks very durable very strong
i don't know if the back the bucket could come out
that'll feel it no
i don't think he can come out so when it comes to that
let me see the package
it comes with come to the stand
oh that's not to bring
that's what they do because it's down there
yeah so i don't know so you can
yeah so you can have them
so they're putting this here the back brace
now it's like you're paying everything is cool
it's heavy it's actually here
it's very heavy do that
that's that's good decent
yeah so it's very it's very good
it's a very good product
it's super yes so it's not free as we were told
we were told that well before the thing they saw that said that it was actually free was well
yes so yeah
it's kind of like a book program
it's an ebook program

Hey guys! Today I'm going to talk about graphic tablet Gaomon m10k 2018 version
Let’s look at what’s inside
Inside the box we find the tablet Itself
A bag for the tablet 8 extra nibs and remover in the felt pouch
A pen with a same felt pouch
A user manual and card which includes information how to download drivers A hand glove
A micro-usb cable to connect tablet to computer
This is how a full set looks like
and now let’s test this tablet
I feel comfortable when I use it and now let's talk more about the tablet itself
The tablet is really nice to look at M10k support the left and right hand mode
It's easy to shift modes in driver
You just need to make the tablet upside down after changing mode
This tablet has 10 programmed keys which you can program as you want
This tablet is middle sized but I can say that it's a bit bigger than my tablet
Working area is 24 by 16 centimeters
m10k is 695g in weight, which ensures better portability and mobility
With 8192 high levels pressure sensitivity
you can make more smooth and natural line
The back of the tablet has four rubber feet
so the tablet doesn't slip when you use it
There is also a jacket for holding a pen
A battery free pen
no need of recharging
so you won't have to worry about losing power and can work continuously
The matte plastic material is really comfortable when you hold it in your hand
you can easily replace it
I also want to tell you about the bag for the tablet
Previously, it's wasn't included in the set and I'm so glad that it's finally was added
It's very important thing if you are going to take your tablet somewhere
A hand glove help you to move your hand easily on the tablet
Using this glove you don’t leave any marks on the tablet
The user manual contains information
how this tablet works and this card shows a website where you can easily download a drivers
A good thing that it takes only about a minute
I like that the lines are smooth
It also depends on the settings you apply
I think I told you about all the important things related to this tablet
I really enjoy to use it in drawing
I love this product because this tablet is not too expensive and easy to use
You can check all the links of this tablet in the description!
I hope that you enjoyed this video
and the tablet
If you are interested, you can find more information about this product on the official website

because that's better but i like sitting here
i like having dirty dream big behind me
welcome welcome to a new studio vlog
it's monday i'm in here all day
uh i have just made myself a coffee um i yeah
i didn't vlog last week
i wasn't in a great headspace last week
uh if you follow me on instagram
uh if you don't follow me on instagram come find me
um that's usually where i post every day
um it's done me the world of good though because i feel great
i feel energized
i feel ready to go
um but yeah that's why there was
no that's why there was no vlog last week so my to-do list
today is like any typical monday
um and that is lots of ad mini bits orders from the weekend
um which
i don't think there's been many um my shop is really quiet at the minute
um which i put out on instagram and it seems to be like for everybody so yeah where
sometimes i might do
30 40 orders in one week which is insane to even say um last week
i think i did four orders
um i've got my zoom calls
i do need to do a little bit of prep for those
um i've made notes but i just need to like familiarize myself with what i want to chat about
i want to tidy up um and then what else so at the end of this week so hopefully by the time
you're watching this
so it's going to be this weekend so i have a lot of prep to do for it
um i have a whole website page to build
um so i've got that to do
yeah so it's gonna be a lovely day but i do want to start off because i have been sent a gift now
i don't get these often
i have been sent some new earphones now
i was so worried
what um people might think of me for um doing it
um because i hadn't seen anybody else share them
i think i'd seen catnip share some um and in the honest truth
um and i do love them
they're noise cancelling
they're wonderful like on an airplane
these are amazing
i did a zoom call last week um i had to wear them but i felt so stupid wearing them
um so i honestly i have been looking into like wireless earphones
i have been looking into them
some of them are so expensive though
i couldn't bring myself to part with them um so anyway when they got in touch
i thought this is wonderful
um so they're here and i'm going to have a look at them
these are the ones
they've gone with
adaptive dual microphone technology filters out unwanted background noise
let's open them
how do i get there
how do i get into it
satisfying plastic removal
okay so it has this little
oh it's gonna be good because i have two zoom calls today so i can actually use them
oh this is so nice so you put them out
oh right i'll tell you what
owner's manual so activate bluetooth on your device
okay oh it just seems to be very easy really old
grandma here doesn't know what she's doing right okay so this is what they were explaining about
so there's different uh like sizes for your ears so these things
this is a right one
let's see yeah
that doesn't feel comfortable
let's try a different one
oh i don't know what i'm doing guys that's right
oh there we go emily emily
ah oh oh yeah
oh yeah i love it
i've never used anything like this before
so yeah that size good for me
i don't know what size that was
i won't say the company but um his dog fit his ears so i'll have to show him
these ones
um right how do we
let's link it lift earphones from the charging case and select studio neo
there we go pairing successful
okay that's exciting
where's your music emily
i'm such a grandma
okay if you tap it once it it's play and pause if you tap it twice
it goes back a song and if you tap it three times it's sound so let me go back a song
okay we're working and it's not can myself it down
people are taking their way
okay they sound wonderful
so yeah these are the studio neo
um let me have a look at the price of them
because that will determine a lot won't they're 69 pounds
i don't think that is bad at all
aren't the other ones like you know which ones i'm talking about
aren't they like crazy expensive 69 pounds
so i've actually been given a deal as well i've been given an offer to share with you
it started again
i've paid my share
very nothing gonna stop me now
cause i'm almost there
um so the headphones are 69 pounds
why not
i think they're wonderful
i'm gonna be using them today
um on my zoom calls and just like i'll just leave them in all day
um but first impressions are i think
they're pretty wonderful
okay the sun seems to have calmed down a little bit now
so i'm kind of gonna move over a little bit if i can
um i've got nothing valuable to say
um just the usual doubt in myself really
um but what's great about these zoom calls is
should i say on charge
so that's good
um the wire is very short on the charging cable
i'm just gonna try to not die of shame
um it's fine i'll i'll how do i get around that
i don't know i'm just going to pretend it didn't happen
so yeah i will go and do this
so hi guys
okay first zoom call of the day is done
these were awesome really
they're really good
i asked everybody um if they could hear me okay and they said yeah sounds great
so um i'm thrilled with them
right let me put them back in their case
i need to get into the habit of doing that
the meeting has been recorded and it is exporting right now
so that's good
i need to kind of upload that so people can watch it if they missed um right
let's see what my table is
it's now 10 past two and i haven't done any work i've done a zoom call
that's all i've done
i need to eat some lunch
um zoom call prep and links have done that okay
next task is orders
so okay we've got there right
let's log in
that can go so
this office is such a mess
you stole my heart
what is it that you do
my life was great till you added colors
you're my heart's desire
i just wanna love
it's actually five to four already five to four and i've had my lunch and i'm back over here
uh earphones going wonderfully i obviously have about two hours until my next zoom call
um i've kind of got all my little ad
mini jobs ticked off so the next big job i've got is for the market
that's happening at the weekend
but it's fine
it's just a very repetitive task
i'm just going to be sat here like watching a bit of youtube and doing this
um and the good thing is i never removed the last market page from my website
well i did i hid it
i hid it but it's still there so i've kind of got that to use but this might take me two hours
so yeah that's what i'm gonna do
okay it's now 25 to six
i'm i'm i'm still no closer to this being finished my brain hurts
my shoulders hurt
but um i'm gonna have to stop soon because my zoom call is happening in 25 minutes
i feel like this day has just
i thought for the next 20 minutes before they come

bye guys you
hey yo what's up and happy 2021.
it's shortcake and i've been getting a lot of questions
about what programs i use to animate and how i actually do it
all you need is a drawing program with layers and video editing software
oh yeah and this
that will give you a free product with your purchase of this tablet
i won't have too much of a struggle
this here is shortcake and she has a new redesign
basically what quarantine does to our hair from staying
i made a whole storyboard for an entire animation
but for this video
we'll just animate two of those rectangles cause i'm lazy and i don't wanna do the whole thing
you think i got time for that
i'd rather finish up re-watching attack on titan gotta catch up for season four
i start with the tip of the head by drawing the rainbow
i lower the opacity of it
then in another layer i redraw that rainbow but slightly higher next up
this guide helps me keep the head solid and consistent and avoids making her look like
she's a melting sponge
bob popsicle now
1 poop 2 poop 3 and so forth
i use black lines and basically ink over the red sketch
i just try to keep in mind about hair gravity and apply it to her hair though
i'm not the best at it
after inking every frame i go ahead and color with a fill
bucket pretty self-explanatory
anybody could do it
add some edgy music to it maybe slap on the background and then boom
it's a pretty easy process
i did this when i was like 11 so i think you could do it too
get ready kiddos
because now it's time to review the gaomon m10k 2018
pen tablet
this tablet is huge
my first ever tablet which i got in 2014 was the wacom intervals
but it's very tiny and in a square shape
the gaomon m10k 2018
this one has 10 customizable keys
iv present buttons here and there
it's really convenient honestly physically
this tablet is light but also very sturdy
since it's not too big it makes it a lot easier to bring around with me in 2020
i had to move like three times but despite that this tablet restored the moves
just don't drop your pen on hard cement force speaking of pen
the pen was pretty good with its 8192 levels of pressure it
the stylus also came in this very neat felt pouch but for me
i just put my stylus in the tag
i made pretty cool right
just scroll down
choose between free
choose your delivery options and on the top of add a payment method
you'll see that the promo is applied
so yeah there you have it so we've now reached the end of the video and thanks for watching wait
i just recently launched my patreon page
feel free to subscribe to me on there and support the future of this channel
any dollar helps and you'll even get to see work in progress shots of my animations
okay see ya beautiful you
it's the time for the cheap tablet from our friends from china
it's a package from chiana time
hey guys welcome back to the channel
that is what we're going to find out today fun fact so this is more like a trilogy at the moment
because it's the third tablet i bought
it's basic explanation about tablet
how you need to set it up okay
so we're having the power
they didn't change out a lot of things and already i found an issue
another thing is and there can be construction area
you can see
there's quite some space between the lcd panel and the plastic casing itself
how bad the quality of the camera is so
i did some quick recording outside
but here we're going to get an headphone jack out for the people that want to use an headphone
of course you can also use the bluetooth capabilities
take consideration if you even want to buy the tablet like this to make a phone call
not every sim card is basically supported and of course we can add the ncf card
okay so i'm giving quick demonstration
let's put it back in and this is just a freaking nightmare
oh boy okay so the question remains is this thing fake first of all
let's boot up cpu zed
i would say hey
so let's go back
let's check out ada64
i could install it this time with the 2020 model
i couldn't install it whatsoever if i signed loaded or from the store
finally i could do this
okay here we
having the androids x20 is the board
when brands no kind of weird in my opinion eight gigabytes of ram 128 gigabyte storage
and let's see mediatek mt 6000 version
and let's see with the display
here you can see the first difference
2080 by 800 with the retailer didn't say that was the resolution of the display
so there's the first lie and look at this 5.1 lollipop
oh man oh man
you can see
there are differences basically on every level with the android display and the cpu
i couldn't find information regarding the storage but if that was a lie i would not be surprised
the same goes for the ram
this is just moment more like it's too good to be true
it's a lie so that is fake
this is just a fact but the question remains
i must say even for and fake spec and better set prehistoric model
that does not really have a very bad playback
so let's try a youtube
yeah i know for people familiar to my channel
i see it a lot at this time so next up
let's try and racing game
but don't get me wrong
that is running on the backhand
so let's take a close look
how good is the response
this is a great game to test it and even for a very old tablet i must say out of the box
if they are still selling this kind of tablets i want to thank you for watching
hello everyone this is graham from unbox tech reviews where today
we're going to have a look at the me berry
m6 dual sim quad core
10.1 inch tablet
i'll just start by having a look at the box you can see
it's got the i mei numbers because it's a dual sim designed by me
doing china
nothing else much on the box
so we'll dive straight in so it's a great color so these are just some sim cards
i've put in there to test out with it later
so you get a bluetooth keyboard
i'll have a look at that shortly
you get a case
you don't need to go hunting around for a case that'll fit it a nice leather effect case
there actually really nice
i'll try that on the tablet a little bit later
you get the screen protector
there the tablet itself
it's got an 8 000 milliamp battery and the rear camera is 8 megapixels
it's got a little flash on there
the front camera is 5 megapixels
the display quite fingerprint heavy norm
that's pretty normal
you can see on the bottom there
you've got two speakers got your volume control power button microphone headphone jack on the top
here you've got your space for your two sim cards and your micro sd card
nothing else on the top
just put that to one side
see what else we get so we've got a 1d card
there user manual cleaning cloth
i believe clean the cloth there get rid of them
fingerprints got your usbc charge
cable got your power brick standard uk power brick there you also get a bluetooth mouse
which i believe is a couple of triple a batteries to get that worker
nice little added feature there a little stylus
i move the box out though
see a nice bright display my app drawer underneath there
so it is compatible with the google play store
that comes pre-loaded on there
so this will connect to your wi-fi by via 2.4
g got some apps there
youtube youtube kids
now streaming directly from the muppet studio switch between the open ups pretty easily
so so and see the pinch and zoom works really well
it's performance wise pretty good
try quick game
so we'll work with simple games like roblox
all we'll have a quick look at the settings
let's say storage
i have downloaded a few apps
so you can see it's used 15.66 out of the 64.
which is really good system
let's see pretty standard
google setup
see everything runs pretty quick really nice switching between the open ups
it's nice and smooth
i'll ins insert the sim card now just so you can see that
it picks up the the local area
so i'll just quickly jump to that so there you can see
i put some sim cards in there and you can see
say sim cards
sim card slot one vodafone slot two o2 as you can see
that works fine
picks up the signal really good just as good as my samsung phone
so go ahead and try the case on there
say that fits in really nice
it's actually a really good case to get included with it slot out for the camera
there folds down got the bluetooth keyboard
there i'll have a quick quick look at that so i'd say the case works absolutely fine
let's have a look quick
obviously you're not going to get amazing quality 4s for the price but it works fine
i will include some of the photos in the review at the end
so you can see the the quality that you get from there
dual sim 10 inch tablet
if you liked the video give it a like subscribe to the channel share around and thanks a lot
i'll see you next time you
hi Abby here something a little different this video
I'm going to do a review for a tablet
it's not something
I've ever really done on this channel before but as most of you enjoy animation anime
you're probably all inspiring artists and tablets are an amazing tool for artists
so the tablet
I'm reviewing today is the Galman 10 display pd-1 161
so how'd it perform after playing with it
I decided to do a drawing to test it out and please be gentle
I'm not the best drawer
which if you watch my update video you will know that
Amanda I love the comic so much
please excuse the horrendous test whenever thank you it gets a little bit better
okay but back
to the tablet review it retails at around 180 pounds
which i think is a pretty good price for a display tablet
usually a display tablet is over 250 pounds
it came well packaged and the setup was very simple
basically plug in and play
you have more buttons to adjust the screen settings
it is a bit thin and small display wise
I didn't have any issues with the pen
and it has extra knobs in the holder
and set up your tablet to the right settings and button functions
it's pretty light overall
I'd give this tablet a good 7 out of 10
I'll quickly mention a few pros and cons to wrap this up
price for a display
tablet is definitely good
the size is good for a small but I would probably prefer a bigger one
the waist is good it builds light
and means you have it can have it on your lap
and it's easier setup and a big chunky slide tablet
the quality of the screen is good
the pen is great
the screen dimensions seem a little weird
I'd say it's just as good I'm much cheaper
and that's my review
I'm sorry I didn't do a better drawer for this
hopefully this was helpful to anyone interested in purchasing this tablet
and let's you know about things to consider when purchasing any tablet out there
I hope you're all staying safe in his blue attire
and you're looking forward to my animations
I'm finally doing a tablet review
okay so as you may have noticed
this isn't exactly the normal type of video
I'm just gonna put all of my cards out on the table early
I needed a new tablet
like bad man my old
it all off you know like one where
oh my god
whoa in return
they'd allow me to keep the tablet that I reviewed and being the cheapskate that I am
I agreed now with all this said I don't plan on pulling any punches here
I'm grateful that they supplied me with a new tablet
but that of course doesn't mean that
I'm gonna give them preferential treatment either
I haven't been paid for this review
all they did was give me the tablet and told me to go nuts so
what are you getting out of the box
this doesn't mean that you can't buy a stand separately or even make one yourself
it just means that the tablet itself might not feel secure and firm on a stand
most of the back is actually made from a pretty slippery plastic which is why
I said that it might not feel secure on a stand so at the end of the day
I just decided to lay this sucker flat down on my counter
now mind you
there are plenty of people out there that prefer this flat position for their tablet
oh god both of them hurt so much
God [ __ ] what I'm trying to say is that your spinal cord will be in great pain
the good news is there's a funny pokemon riding your neck
the bad news is is that your neck looks like this
just plug the wires into their appropriate ports and bam
the only semi confusing part for some people might be installing the drivers
but even that's pretty easy
just visit the website in the instructions and hit download on what you need
a couple of friends told me that sometimes tablet drivers seem to conflict with one another but
I don't know why I would want to use my old tablet when I have a new one
thankfully the pen itself doesn't run on separate power
I run into this with other tablets
no separate power or a need to charge works right out of the box
so that's pretty nice the only thing
I'm not a huge fan
look good now for a proper showcase and test of what this thing can do
I'll be showing off some speed drawers and random art that I put together with this thing
so more about the tablet after taking some time to get used to the display
it's pretty damn nice to use
I did run into a couple of issues for a little bit
a lot of my line art is done with no pressure sensitivity
the two fingered artist glove is made of a fabric that helps reduce friction
this package goes for about 184 dollars on Amazon
the question being is it worth that much for a beginner
tablet user like me
I'd like to say so
who wants to get into tablets
if you feel like it could be a worthwhile purchase with your continued artistic development
I say that this is a worthwhile upgrade from a standard non display tablet
no shame if you're a beginner and want to start on a display tablet though
I just see this as a upgrade rather than a good start does that make sense
I think that makes sense okay
well that about wraps things up
I didn't write an outro for this video
it's really awesome in a very very easy way for me to jump around everybody
this is not a tutorial
and then we're gonna have another video
which will give you a link for that also has the tool video and how we how
I use these together so first of all
I want to talk about the stylus
we usually last me about three weeks
how simple it is you just simply grab a hold and with the remarkable pad
there's a replacement in the cap so you simply drop out the new tip
insert it in the end
and you're all good to go for another three or four weeks so
I wanted to demonstrate that to you
this is a pretty cool feature
I don't even know how much the replacements cost so I wanted to go over with the stylus
this is pretty cool alright
version 2.0 is an upgrade over version
1.8 as to how the home screen is laid out
it's much easier to use and much more functional and again this is not a tutorial
the folders are all laid out across the top
so here's my Matterhorn folder
Alliance and that is its own monster so I need to keep track of all of these activities
all you do is just touch on the folder
it pulls up that folder
now you can see here across the top
you can add a new folder within that folder
a notebook and quick sheets
and let me just show you how
I use this
and what makes it so spiffy
so this is my staff meeting folder every Monday morning at 10 o'clock at Matterhorn
we have a staff meeting and by touching this button here and hitting an overview
I can look at all of my notes from the previous staff meetings
I use a broad stroke and I put down the date
so here's the date of January the 27th February the 3rd February the 10th
and here's last week
March the 2nd and so what I do and I'm just going to
I saved this just so I could show you in this demo
here are the items that I want to talk about in today's staff meeting
scroll back with client information
I have one folder
I do the same thing
I don't need to put the client's name because I'm in that notebook
I really like the highlighter function
so if there's something in on this page that
I want to easily be able to find
I can take the highlighter and I can write here
I can see at a glance this date
and there's something highlighted here
wait a minute did
I forget to do something
oh yeah
I'm supposed to call Joe so for me
the highlighter function is very important
it's really awesome in a very very easy way for me to jump around
now let's say just to give you an idea of how this functions for me let's say that
it gives me my folders across the top
communication to do's that
what was a conversation about so this helps me
keep all of my activities and thoughts organized
okay here's another feature that
I can make it very thick and now I can mark this up
so let's say
she completely understands if I take this what I just did on here
she knows exactly what I want and so what I can do then is this is the share button
I can take this file
I can put flyer edit in here so I can send it as three different types of files
I always just send it back as a PDF so I have all this ready to go
I'm ready to send her my edits
I hit Send
it's gone so
I think this is pretty amazing
this really really makes my life so much easier
i hit send by email
I go through all the same exercise that I just showed you and I'm able to shoot this off so for me
this is pretty priceless where
and then you can make your edits okay in the same vein
let's say last year it was six hundred thousand
their materials and subs were two hundred thousand
which gives us real revenue spendable money of four hundred thousand and then
and there's an erase feature
that is really awesome where you can just use this as an eraser like this
there's another erase feature where you can erase the selection what that means is
I think this is pretty amazing
another really awesome feature that was on version 1.8 but has been upgraded on version
it gives me a blank piece of paper
I can jot down all of my notes
stop the shipment
I'm in a hurry I might even pull over to the side of the road
but it's in the wrong place
it's in just a
it's like a sticky note
almost all right now
here's what's really cool is
I can send this to the proper folder
it's really cool
I come down here
I can make a duplicate of that
here's what I want
I want to move this sheet of paper out of quick sheets into another folder now
let's take a look so on a movie so it asked me move out where do
I want to move it out to all right
find the notebook and make all the notes or is like now
I can just jot something down real quickly make a quick sheet
shoot it over if I have a note that needs to be in two different folders
you can make copies within the same folder within the same notebook so for me
I like to keep things pretty much in date order and you can see the way that I use that
paint brush stroke
I'm using version 2.0
it's a huge upgrade from 1.8
with regards to what
some people say it's too expensive quite honestly it's priceless for me
it keeps all my different activities organized
it's all right here in one place so two thumbs up for remarkable 2.0
I hope this has been helpful
so uh uh is together together come on another
i try to cheer up but i just feel the same
i guess i could take the subway
get real high and fun days
real laid back like sunday
i guess i can't complain

come get your yourself
everybody needs some love
my eyes feel free my dreams crush feel free so guys my dreams sails feel free my dreams
hi folks
I'm Nathan with the e-book reader comm for this video
I'm going to give you guys a review with a Fire HD 8 tablet
it's among the latest lineup of new tablets from Amazon
along with the $49
there's just the size difference with the screen
so let's go ahead and talk about the hardware first
it's a 8 inch tablet
of course it's got the 10 or the 1280 by 800 resolution
and this one's actually quite nice
it's got a really nice rigid
feel to it feels very solid
we've got the camera up here in the top corner
there's a micro
it's got like more of a premium
feel to a lot thinner
a lot lighter
I am impressed with the overall hardware of this model so for the most part
I'm impressed with the screen
it does have really nice
it only has the 1280 by 800 screen
so that's 189 pixels per inch so I mean it's not too bad
the screen actually looks quite nice
it kind of minds me of
Samsung's tablets
it kind of reminds me of those so
is this new fire
OS 5 operating system
this is the main home screen what it is is essentially your app drawer
you've got the store link so it's the same theme with every different section
here you got your continued watching and you got the recommended
titles below it and the same links over there so it's just how this new operating system lays out
I do like it a lot
better than the old carousel layout that you used to have
have this bar up here
let's go ahead and remove this because kind of annoying removed from home
and then you'd normally just look like this with your apps here on the home section
these ones are installed from the Amazon store
you can't really do as many customizations as you can like with the regular
you tap here
we get the different font choices
book early is the new default
we've got these on the list here options
we've got different color options
if you wanted like a green background we've got the Goodreads integration up there
what's that button
you can go ahead and adjust how many hints you want as you can see right there
so that's just kind of a feature for those learning language or some kids learning three
you've also got the word run or flashes of word in the center of the screen
I'm going to show that in step review to talk about it more
I see things going as I think look tablet
I forgot to mention it earlier
it has two speakers on the top edge right here
and that's all so they project out quite well
they don't get muffled easily tone
she's got good sound
Island as far as the volume is concerned
well gentlemen continue the captain
I don't know who has this map
you can also use text-to-speech if you don't have the audiobook downloaded you
it'll play text-to-speech but I don't have any way to do that right now
it's all your books downloaded
it's also got the wikipedia entry down here
you can get translations where that works
is you just type in select a different language
get the translation the week Wikipedia entry you can just launch the web browser by tap on that
Amazon video services you can download videos and now that supports the SD card
you can even have the videos on the SD card which is nice
I did notice reading the manual that the SD card does not support audiobooks
so you can't move audio books or ebooks to the SD card
which is kind of interesting
everything's nice and bright and clear
it's got good strong viewing angles
it does look quite good so comics illustrate the what
I'm saying about the screen very well
so this comic
it looks fantastic
it actually looks quite good when you have it
scrolled in to the sides here to fit to wit the text extra looks quite good
just not quite as nice
some of the other tablets out there
as far as the high-res screens go users have to test out the touch screen
it actually seems to work good
I don't have any issues with touch screen
I don't have any issues with it
not having any responsiveness
here's a sample of
YouTube video plays so yeah
YouTube videos work
I'm gonna go ahead and wrap up this video right here
check out the e-book reader comm for some additional information
I post how-to guides and like free
ebooks deals so
check that out if you want some additional information thank you guys for watching
right hi guys
I have gone with a Huey um I've used these guys before
and they
they may seem quite good there
it's kind of an older one so
there's about 50 pounds to buy this one it's currently a little bit more
it's about 100 pounds on Amazon
but it's got bluetooth
it's got a battery feel free pen now
the previous few
well that's a bit awkward
I mean I'm looking forward to trying it out and seeing how well that works so right
that's oh yeah the model is an inspiration
Kay version 2 version 2 is important
because that's what that's when they upgrade they put the battery for you
plan the nearest doctor parking
but let's ignore that that's fine so let's open up and have a look
I have opened it before but put it all back nicely for the purpose of this video
a little wait
I'm super nice
thank you card
it's very polite
you're welcome what was he
we'll see if you're welcome if we like the tablet
the tablet itself comes in a nice nice packet
that's protective film thing
it's got a nice build quality doesn't feel too light or anything that feels reasonably solid
you can imagine it could feel a little bit more solid but it's a nice a nice shape and size
it's kind of a nice feel to it
it's got some buttons down the side
I rarely use the hotkeys when I'm using one of these tablets
then what the ones in the
Wacom that I use it work and I've never configured to use I just
I'm just too used to the the shortcuts in Photoshop
the things to point out are the on the end
it's got a on and off because it's Bluetooth wireless Bluetooth
I'm assuming that you can just have it connected via cables off like I guess off mic that
I tend to do sure you keep the wiring
I get on with
it's a little lock on it
I have no idea
I guess we'll find out what that's not
but yeah this the actual tablet so it's also a nice size
it's yeah it's about the size of the into us
this is the temporary
Wacom which is a tiny little bamboo thing
it should allow me to be a lot more sensitive in my in my drawing and designing and stuff
I guess I'll find out if it is then on some things like on the Mac
I won't actually need it because I've got bluetooth it's got bluetooth going but we'll see
Everett rusty penholder
these are always handy
I assume that these containing yes the nibs
that's good you can show you that
they're all their selection of replacement nibs in there as much survived as I've used a welcome
I have never broken the nitwit touch wood touch wood
it's it's not so
I know a lot of you wear them down
I I guess for doing this stuff I use is it's all for like texture and 3d models and maybe
that's quite the pin
it's so quite look
it's not too light not too heavy
the previous huion tablet
I guess I had to hold it with a tighter grip over time
this one looks a lot more like the
Wacom Intuos pen
I know I've seen some people use the pen from up here
maybe that people who are used to using a paintbrush
yeah it feels quite nice
I guess time will tell how comfortable is to use but it feels very familiar
so that's a good thing it's got two buttons
I assume they're configurable just like they are on most tablets usually
I'll just leave it as default and have it as a left and right click but again
I didn't use them very much
I don't as far as I can tell okay
I'm sure they're handy but I don't tend to use them very much
I don't think it does because it's rounded in a weird way so I think that would be strange
just hold out though
I think it'd be strange if that was the eraser because it's kind of did focus there
let's see how well it sits in here
that's pretty good
if you like to keep your pen horizontal depends how you probably tend to work
I guess how much space you've got on your desk
I tend to like elebrate so just grab it straight out there
just pop those back in other things we've got
there's a download driver manual
there's not any anything any CD's in there you know some reason it made it look like a CD
we're always out of date by the time you come to use them and they had issues so
I guess not bundling the driver so you have to go to the website download
it seems like a good idea so
I guess you can use any one if this breaks and hopefully it doesn't break it
it's good it's reasonable quality
I can't complain about that doesn't again doesn't feel too cheap at all
so considering the price of the tablet versus some of the more expensive tablets
it's er it's nice eh
after a little
I'm using it
I've been using Photoshop Elements with it
it's quite nice
it's quite surprised
actually how its
I think it must only be like an inch or two wider than the Intuos
Pro that I'm using at work but it does feel that much wider
so you've got to move the pen a bit more to get across the screen now
you can configure that in
its tool the install so you can configure the sensitivity by quite like the extra
you know the it kind of throws you a little bit
I guess that's probably if people ever ever go from like a medium up to a large into us
Supra have the same thing
absolutely no problems with that
there was no no delay in the latency when I was drawing and that was I was drawing while recording
I'm just talking over the recording rather than actually talking while I draw
it wasn't able to do that and concentrate
but yes there's no no no lag while
I was drawing so it's good and I was always kind of worried about if it was
the bump means you
do you think it's ever so slightly lighter than the
I use it at all so it's quite happy with that
you got to use the switch on the side to the on and off switch
some of the into us once you can you can have the rotate to take it
on pretty short you can view and it all picked up as well but listen this pen
this tablet and pen don't have that
so that's that's probably one one down tick verses
V into us that you might get so the overall impressions of the tablet
I'm really happy with it
I'm really happy that it
it's it's a really nice feeling size
I had some little problems with the older huy on top
I had where it would know
I needed to get a specific version of the driver
the newer drivers just didn't work with the tablet for whatever reason so
who knows if future drivers will have problems
I'm quite happy with using it like and as you can see
I've got absolutely no complaints
there it was
it was a joy to use so
I mean even though it's a wireless tablet I'm not likely to be carrying around
very many places can attend to how
I've got my workstation at home and I use it there so within one place I expect
he'll it'll manage to to operate for a good long time
I mean I've never had a tablet actually break on me so that's good
yes so there is
that's my review
I think I'd probably give the tablet about an 8 out of 10
the the presentation is really nice
the you know it comes in a really nice box
it feels well packaged and like
it's it'll have been safe in transit
you know really good like
I say I would have
it could have been it could have felt bit sturdier
but it's that's a you know quite a minor thing
usability of the tablet again with the with the connectivity
being so fluid to go between wireless and connected by the cable
that's great
I'm actually really interested to see what huion do over time
because they are getting better with each kind of with each product
I get they seem to be getting you know
the drivers feel more professional
the products are definitely improving over time
they're adding features to the tablets too to bring them up in line with the with the with
Wacom stop and range I personally
Wacom to task and providing a good range of different sizes and different things
the screen tablets again also now using the battery free pens so I can imagine a lot of people
who are you
Wacom one I'll go for the three to four hundred
yeah this brand is actually
they're not bad at all
I'd probably give her an eight out of ten
and that's that's not something you can complain about for for
a hundred pound
turbo is 110 pounds
I think it was an Amazon
so yeah thanks for listening
I'm watching hope you enjoyed my terrible creatures
always drawing they
I thought I'd just sketch some ideas for some wood fell creatures while I was doing it
but yeah thanks for watching guys see you later

all the information and pricing on these amazing tablets
hey everybody its LAN sideburn and we're checking out the RCA cambio today
this is a device sold exclusively through
Target stores here in the United States for about two hundred dollars
so it's got some flexibility as to how you can configure it
nothing too fancy on the latching mechanism here either
computer actually feels pretty good
compared to many of the others we have looked at over the last couple of months
free for software installation on here
there is a card slot
it are pretty good actually
it's not too bad on the viewing angle side
the display quality is okay
it's not going to be as good as more expensive
tablets are but it's good enough given the price point especially if you're looking for something
cheap and detachable
the display is certainly passable compared to what we've seen in other places
I do like the keyboard quite a bit
a nice large keys nicely spaced apart so very nice to type on really nice travel on them too
they do feel a little cheap and thin but it really isn't bad to type on with some real again
do travel time here
the distance the key goes down when you push it is really nice and among the nicest
I've seen on department-store tablets for sure
there is a passable trackpad on here
it isn't too bad the one thing that was interesting about it
is that if you click right in the middle
nothing happens because there's a divider line here between the left
click and the right click so if you click on this side you get the left
click on this side
so you can't do a two-finger click but you can do a two finger
scroll so you do have that option available to you so a decent trackpad again for the price
the little power standby switches right here
I got that HDMI port that we talked about
it might be a little bit slower than the storage
you'll get out of the internal drive on it but you do have that available to you
this doesn't you know
erase the tablet but it does actually reset the tablet
when you push it now it is recessed quite a bit but you can push it fairly easily so I was
it's kind of odd that they didn't go as one of those little paper clip buttons versus this
there won't delete anything
there is a camera on the back in the front
nothing to be excited about but you can take some some decent pictures
I guess but it's not really going to do well as a photographing device
so let's take a look now and see how it performs all right
let's take a look at my youtube channel
real quick and see how fast it renders up things on-screen both HTML and video
so here we go
our screen is loading up right now
this feels about the same as other
pretty nicely actually
no dropped frames here
a very smooth playback
we can go fullscreen on this too and just see how that performs there so these
Adam Bay Trail chips even though they're not the most powerful things in the world
I really do web browsing and video playback quite nicely as you can see here
we're not having any lag at all
and it really is a decent experience overall and on the octane benchmark test
a little bit harder to navigate with this less expensive trackpad on here
but you get the idea
that's hot out
there right now is not going to run on here very well
things like stream games from other devices in the home
that might surprise you but just don't have high expectations for that going in but one thing
I was pleased to see
is that the warranty on
this is a year versus 90 days that
I have looked at recently
so that is a good thing
it's about 2.8
this is LAN size and thanks for watching
YouTube you play as little as a dollar a month visit lang pd / patreon to learn more
so I would highly recommend going out and getting one of these probably get a different stand
I did get this tablet for free
I requested that I be able to be honest
I'm gonna let you guys know what's good about the tablet what is kind of a and what
wow this is the guy we're gonna be reviewing here the artist 12
Pro so the price for this tablet is $250 and for a screen tablet that's super affordable
that's really cheap but yeah let's get started
let's let's unbox this
see see what we're getting ourselves into
I have no idea what's in here so we're gonna find out as we go
well let's see what we got alright so we open up the box here
alright let's see it
looks like it's packaged pretty nicely
you've got a contact information if you run into any trouble cute little
Corgi mascot pull this guy out so at first glance it's super compact
it's really really light
it doesn't weigh hardly anything
it's packaged really
nice it's in clear plastic film
we'll get to the tablet itself in a bit but let's see what else is in here
there's still a lot more box to go through
oh well that's cool so it actually comes with the stand
I did not expect that
that's pretty cool
you know my $3,000
Wacom tablet did not come with a stand
that's an extra charge so good on you
XP pen that's that's awesome and it feels alright
it feels like decent enough plastic
I'll have to mess with that in a bit
I'm not sure how it pops out
we'll probably have to read the instructions on that one twelve months not bad
I assume it just covers manufacturer defects
not if you drop it in a tub of water or anything
let's see do customer
thank you for choosing to support XP tablets
these are super useful
I get asked about my smudge guard a lot
these gloves can be super useful
so it's nice that it comes with that so you just put it on like so put it on your drawing hand
it feels nice
it doesn't feel super cheap
I mean the fits not the greatest I definitely like my smudge guard
a lot more but for something that comes free with the tablet
you can see that which is cool
it's nice that it comes with extra pen
nibs unscrew that here see
there's your pen nibs right there
it definitely doesn't feel as nice as the Wacom Cintiq of course it's very light
it's a very light plastic
it doesn't really have any heft to it and the balance is a little funny
it's it feels heavier up here so it's a little top-heavy but the rubber feels nice
it feels comfortable
it's definitely a comfortable shape pen
nibs pretty long which is not a good or a bad thing just something
I noticed pen
buttons are are clicky
you know they don't feel mushy or anything
I'd have to say pretty cool
so let's put that back in
its case for safekeeping for now and is that it that feels like it so pretty nice packaging
just feel really nice
they feel like good quality it feels like they care about their product unlike
XP pen a lot compared to like hooey on or something like that so now let's get to it
let's um let's actually work on this tablet here actually before we do that before we do that
let's figure out how to set up this stand so it was confusing me at first
I didn't want to break it so this part flips out somehow
okay that popped out there we go you just got to pop it out with a little bit
this thing is super light
but let's take off this plastic there
we go peel all that off
get it nice and situated here so you guys can see ooh and then
uh everybody's favorite part about new electronics the P Alize
oh okay so now that we've done our unboxing
let's install the thing so
yeah I didn't put hardly any pressure on it and it just kind of collapsed
I don't know how I feel about that stand
I might suggest getting a different stand for you
um let's see okay so on my laptop
let's talk about some of the features of this tablet so it features a display
that's almost twelve inches
it's 11 point something
it says it has 8,192 levels of pressure sensitivity
the human hand can't actually differentiate between that many levels of pressure
we'll try it out
see how it goes and the pen actually has tilt function which is cool
that's a function that usually only
Wacom pens have so
I'll be excited to try that out
see how that feels and like
I said earlier
the pen doesn't use a battery
you don't have to charge it
which again is something that
I thought only Wacom would have which that's really cool
that's awesome actually it features eight shortcut keys on the tablet and it has one roller wheel
usually these shortcut keys um
I almost never use even on my tablet
but we'll play around with them
we'll see how they go
and yeah overall the look of the tablet itself
it looks really nice
it looks like a good piece of construction
we'll see how it feels when we actually draw in it ok so now
I'm gonna try and get this tablet to display the same display
that's on my computer laptop computer laptop
so there's a power button right here
I'm gonna press that in to turn it on there we go
we've got a logo
oh hey look
we don't even have to do anything to have it display on here
it just does it automatically all right moment of truth
how's the um how's the pen respond
so it's moving
it's following my cursor
let's test the corners
it seems like it's following pretty accurately
yeah like I said the pen feels very light and kind of flimsy selecting and dragging feels good
the screen itself feels nice
it's not slippery like glass or anything
it's got a little bit of a matte
that would be useful to talk about
this pen doesn't have an eraser typically with
Wacom pens this opposite side would have a pressure sensitivity eraser
I would use a hot key or something so yeah
I'm starting up a clip studio paint
which is my favorite drawing program
I have to say like first impressions using this thing
it looks awesome like the display
looks really nice
it's not too bright and it's not too dim
the colors are okay
I'm not a huge color expert
we'll see what they do will also open up the driver
which um you know is kind of the biggest deal with these off-brand tablets
so here's the big test
let's uh see if there's any pressure sensitivity by default wowie-zowie
would you look at that
it works right off the bat
I probably spent two to three hours
getting that thing to work just uninstalling drivers reinstalling it
what a pain
this thing is awesome
this was really easy to install
I'm super stoked about that
so yeah let's uh open up the driver
click double click left
click scroll up right click scroll down or I can do shortcuts ctrl alt shift or Windows
Oh you can also have it
do open tablet settings find detail mode
klk are mode switch
I'm not sure what that does
let's find out ok
LKR oh is that the the wheel function it is ok
that's kind of cool
so with the klk
R function I can press the button on my mouse and I don't know if you can see it in the video
but it's saying different modes down at the bottom so right now
it's like clicky
it's it's not smooth and I actually like that
it's got a really tactile feel it doesn't feel like mushy like it does on my
oh that's kind of cool if I press it again
that's pretty neat
yeah so far
I'm very impressed with the driver on this tablet
so let's set that to middle click is what
I usually set my second mouse
button - this one's on right click
we'll keep that right
click for now
you know it's got a calibrate button but I'm gonna choose not to calibrate it actually
it's actually pretty dang accurate just out of the box even on the corners can
I right-click in the corner here
I can so that's the thing I can't do on my other monitor or my other screen tablet
yeah wow it's already calibrated
it looks so good display settings
what does that do
please set your monitors to extend mode
okay so what this means is right
so that's pretty cool now
so that's pretty cool that's useful just for ease of use
I'm gonna set it back to duplicate display for now that way
my laptop and this screen are displaying the same thing and I seem to have lost the pen
the pen doesn't seem to be working anymore
what's going on with that
let's see so
it's working fine so another setting over here is how soft or how hard your brush is
that's probably depending on how you like to draw but zero feels very comfortable
but that's cool that you can customize that
I know a lot of artists really like editing the pressure sensitivity on their brushes
this is useful
it's windows ink
you need to either turn it on or turn it off it really
there's no one answer
sometimes that can make a difference express key settings
let's see so the first one opens up our tablet settings which is what we're in right now
the second one is alt
and you get a little notification down here at the bottom telling you what the hot key is doing
so that's pretty useful
the third one is space so space
so that's undo cool
the fifth one is zoom in and then zoom out for the sixth one for the seventh
it's um now it's my brush size
what happens when I click in the wheel can I click it in nope
is that what that means
no oh
I see so the klk our function
advance one frame turn it left
go back a frame
so if you're doing frame by frame animation that could be useful
we'll just leave it as default for now so cancel and it seems like
that's everything in the driver overall
I'm very impressed
I'm very happy with that
it's got everything that the
it's not super smooth to draw on but nothing
it's a bit sticky parallax wise
let's see if I get a pen and I make it super small parallax wise
it feels pretty on the nose
yeah even if I have my pen to an extreme angle like this it still tracks it pretty well
I'm having no problem whatsoever
it's not liking at all
yeah dang XP pen I love this thing
this thing's awesome would
I pay 250 dollars for this absolutely yeah
I would recommend this
100% the only downside
is you know it feels portable like this thing is super light
I wish this was a self-contained unit but it's not
your computer doesn't have to be super close
what happens if I shut the screen on my laptop
does this stay on
no okay so yeah
is there a pen that we can do with tilts on it
I want to test the tilt function
okay check that out the
it's not drawing at all oh
I guess it is but you have to push down a little bit
it seems to work from a certain angle
I mean of course but that's something you'd have to get used to well
yeah that's pretty cool
most of these off-brand tablets don't have a tilt function
so that's awesome
that's really cool
I think that's gonna do it
this tablet's awesome
i 100% recommend it
you know time would tell so far
I have no issues with it
it turned on fine
installation was easy
the drivers are awesome
I'm trying to think of a bad thing to say about it
I'm used to drawing pretty tiny so I would be fine with this
but yeah the rotation thing is nice
another thing to complain about is maybe the pen doesn't feel the greatest
it's pretty light
it doesn't really have any heft to it
I feel like well I don't know I don't think if I drop this on the ground it would break
I don't think it's that fragile
I wouldn't do it on purpose but yeah it feels like it would hold up to a fall or two
I wouldn't really complain
the pen feels fine the nib like I was saying is plastic
and you know when you're drawing on the screen
it definitely feels like plastic against a rubber kind of what I was saying so it's a bit gummy
it's not the best feeling
it certainly doesn't feel like paper um just for for fun
we can try putting on this anti glare screen on it
I immediately know I'm not gonna like this
it's getting a lot of bubbles and stuff
I wasn't very careful about putting it on
it looks bad honestly drawing on it
that actually feels worse yeah
I probably wouldn't put the screen protector on
I really like this tablet a lot
some of the pros about it there was no parallax to be seen
it was super easy to draw on
the drawing surface is a bit gummy
it doesn't feel like paper or glass
it's a bit kind of sticky
not too bad
the stand that comes with is very unstable
I would recommend getting a different stand for it
and probably my least favorite part about the tablet is its HDMI
only which if you don't have a computer that has an HDMI port
thank you for listening to my tablet review and
I'll catch you guys next time
take it easy buh-bye
- Thanks for joining me.
I'm Aaron Rutten and in this video I'm going to be reviewing the Parblo Mast 22 display tablet.
That's coming up next.
(funky music) (scribbling) (paper ripping) (paper crumpling)
First, let's take a quick look at an overview of the features.
The Parblo Mast 22 is a display tablet
you can draw on with a pressure-sensitive pen.
The pen supports over 8,000 pressure levels.
Now let's go a bit deeper into some of the features and specifications of the Parblo Mast 22.
That makes this a great tablet for large-gesture drawing.
don't go near the edge of the screen.
It does not feel slippery to draw on, like some of the other Cintiq alternatives I've tried.
The feel is nice, but the screen protector itself does not stick very well to the tablet.
It's actually already peeling off.
The color gamut is wide, but color accuracy is a bit off.
My Spider5 colorimeter measured Adobe RGB at 79%.
Other display tablets have a control panel
that can be repositioned on-screen.
Now let's discuss the pen.
The pen is very basic and it requires charging before you can use it.
There is not an eraser on the pen and the pen does not support pen tilt.
Pen pressure on the Mast
22 is very smooth.
Lines taper nicely.
It's easy to get light pressure.
The transitions and the line within opacity are even.
wear out, you have eight replacement nibs hiding inside of the pen stand.
The cursor also strays a bit when you move near the left and right edges of the screen.
Since many slider bars are located here, that may make it difficult to grab the handle.
Also, I noticed that double-click doesn't register some of the time.
So that just about sums up the pen.
Let's move to the exterior of the device.
I appreciate the thin design of this tablet. It's seven millimeters thick at its thinnest point.
Instead of being made of mostly plastic, it's made of metal.
The cable connections are a little bit weak.
I'd be concerned about them breaking or becoming disconnected by accident.
There are not any express keys on the exterior of the Mast 22
and the driver does not offer on-screen keys.
There are some buttons
There's only a small gap between the tablet edge and the desk.
You can do this by going into your display settings and changing it from duplicate to extended.
Once you've done that, you may also want to adjust the UI scaling for the Mast 22
so that your application
UI doesn't take up too much of the screen.
Once you get extended mode working with the UI scaling set
The control panel has very limited options.
It doesn't offer quite as much as many of the other display tablets do, but it worked well enough.
I don't see a way to disable that.
In regards to the driver quality, the drivers are a bit buggy.
I found that I've had to uninstall and reinstall them on several occasions
just to get the cursor to appear on the correct screen.
Now let's talk about the stand.
Included with the Mast
22 is an adjustable stand that attaches securely to the tablet.
Nevertheless, it does a good job of keeping your tablet stable when you're drawing on it.
(funky music) All right. So now for my conclusion.
All right, so that was my review of the Parblo Mast 22 display tablet.

some more of my drawing tablet reviews.
Thanks for watching and I'll see you next time.
hi this is justice with tablet pro in this quick video
i'm going to talk about how i set up my camera in order to do zoom calls and take notes
i just watched a video
i was inspired by brett from oz tablet review
so i'm going to show you his youtube page here
this is brett oz tablet pc and uh he has really great content
if you guys if you're not subscribed to him yet on youtube i highly recommend it
i'd rather just turn my video off but right now what i'm doing is i'm using my iphone
i have an iphone 11 pro iphone
droid cam droid cam
let's go ahead and open this up right here
droid cam client
if i click on this this will open up a little tiny window and we are not going to start it
so you're going to get your device ip from the app on your iphone go to dev47apps.com
droid cam come on all right but droid cam client download right there
the install is very very simple and it's very small
you're going to click start
this works with skype
it works with teams
it works with anything that allows you to choose between the front and back camera
droid cam client will basically run a virtualized camera and allow you to choose that
so i can have my wireless phone in front on a just a phone holder
a tablet stand or whatever
i can take notes if i'm watching because i can't see anything
i'm looking at the back side of my camera
the back side of my phone
i can't see the screen and i can't see the other person so here
droid cam is recording me
and let's go over here and let's select one of brett's videos okay
we're just going to play this one as a small business owner
it's easy to feel alone
sometimes we're going to mute okay
so let's pretend i'm talking to brett
hi i like your computer
whisper shirt actually is pretty cool
i like seeing brett's legs
i don't know why it's awkward that he's in like a polo shirt with buttons and shorts
i can watch the screen if i want again
that's most comfortable for my camera
setup all right you guys that's it
i'm sure you will have questions the two different ones i use for obs studio
if you have a windows
10 tablet and a stylus subscribe to this channel
it is made for you until next time
stay creative and have a wonderful day
this is the new Cintiq 16
it's a new budget price display from
so what is this
it is a pen display basically
it's an external monitor that connects to your computer
Windows or Mac and you can draw on it using the included pen
what's new here well
notice here the lack of the word
there's been a lot of competition and that competition has really improved
and so you have all these companies releasing cheaper pen displays so what
Wacom is doing here is
sometimes taking something away it can be a good thing nice
sometimes taking something away can be a bad thing
so what are the trade-offs what have they done to bring the price down
well let's take a look at the
Cintiq 16 I have here and compare it to the Cintiq Pro 16
the biggest difference here is the screen itself
and so you're gonna get a crisper image
the pro also has a laminated display
Wacom calls this optical bonding basically what it does is it
this screen is a film on the pros
it's edge class and that etch glass goes edge to edge now when you list them out like this
these do sound like big trade-offs but in terms of specs every they're 16-inch pen display
that's available now at the time that
I'm doing this review currently pretty much
has these same exact specifications
so why get this why go with a walk-on for me
the most compelling reason is this this is what comes pro pen too
I've used the pro pen too before on the Cintiq pro 24
Wacom is my personal gold standard
it really feels natural slow angled lines
they're perfect there's no fiddling there's no stroke smoothing that you need to add to it
it's it's exactly the way
it's all there
the pressure curve feels very natural in the illustration
I'm doing in the background when I'm coloring in
I'm using a really wide brush
I increase the size of that brush
I want it to now the biggest difference between this and the Cintiq Pro is that parallax
it's much easier to do that on the Cintiq pros because it has that bonded screen
there's less space
I should also mention because I tend to forget cuz it's not a feature
I use a lot but this stylus has tilt support
you can tilt the pen this way
you could tilt the pen that way
that's fairly rare in many other third-party devices in fact
I don't know if there is another 16 inch tablet that has tilt on the pen
boo-yan has been slowly adding it to some of their devices but we haven't seen a full rollout yet
the screen itself looks really good and I really like the 16 inch size
I've set it in other videos
it's luxurious to have that much space but it's not always practical for every desk setup
the color spectrum listed here is 72%
accuracy have one monitor calibrated to be super accurate
and then they're using something else to draw on anyway
this is all to say
I'm really bad at judging color
accuracy can you tell me what color you see on this chart
II I think the colors look fine
if you flip this thing over along the back you're gonna see that there are some legs that pop up
there is a stand that
Wacom has on its website available for about $80
it should be available in the store by the end of the month
it attaches to the back of the display
there are four holes back there and I believe that those four holes are a VESA standard size
so if you wanted to use another stand you could do that too
this comes with a combo cable
which lets you attach your power and attach an HDMI cable and your USB cable
I did miss here that I've seen on other tablets are shortcut keys
there's nothing in the in the box
my script says rewrite that sentence brad oops just be clear
there is other stuff in the box
just not the remote
you got the pen you got the power adapter doodad you got the combo cable alright so
I'm looking in the Box now
I don't think that it came with any kind of stand or extra nibs with the pen
and if you don't like having the loop there you can just pop it out
oh look there are extra nibs
there tucked away behind this little
pull out tab
how did I miss that now one thing
I do want to talk about a little bit
that folks were having problems with drivers
it was super easy to setup
I do like Wacom software and how their drivers are set up
so let's talk a little bit about pros and cons
the pros definitely go with the pen
here you're getting wha comes best pen ever at their lowest
Cintiq price ever the cons
my personal opinion is that the quality of the pen is the main thing
I'm looking for in any drawing tablet and since this does that so well
I think it's a pretty good step
it makes sense to kind of tear their product line a little bit and capture some of that market
maybe it's an experiment to see what the market wants either way
I'm a big fan of it
I think it works well
I have for today
thank you guys for watching and I'll see you in a couple of dates
hello everyone in this week's video
i'm drawing one of my viewers original characters and reviewing the veekvk 1200 pen display so
this video is going to be different than my usual
i draw your oc videos
think of it as in
i draw your oc mini
i thought i'd draw one of those but before we take a look at the oc
let's take a look at the tablet
so this is the week vk 1200.
it does have a screen
so you're able to draw on the screen in the box
they need to be plugged into a laptop or a computer here
we have the quick start guide and a little card telling us where we can get the drivers
also they give you a ton of nibs my goodness they are very generous with the pen
nibs and there are more pen
nibs hiding with the pen stand
speaking of the pen you get two of them for some reason
i'm not sure why you get two pens but it is nice to have an extra one
the work area is 11.6 inches and it has an anti-glare film applied to it
the screen is fully laminated
so there is no gap in between the glass and the screen
this tablet is on the smaller side and is definitely portable here
it is next to my 10.2 ipad as a size comparison on the left
we have six customizable express keys and on the right
we have the spots for the cords to plug in
we also have the power button and the display brightness button
i do think it'd be nice
if the tablet came with some kind of stand for this review i'll be using a stand
i got from a previous tablet
so next was setting up the tablet which went smoothly
i do want to mention that
they do not give you an adapter if it does need to be plugged into a wall
they say you can use a standard phone charger
but i think it would be nice if they gave you an adapter thankfully
my laptop is able to power the tablet it does seem to drain the battery a little bit
uh so i keep
my laptop plugged in while using the tablet
so i do have more to say about the tablet but first let's take a look at the character
i will be drawing so this character was created by fluffy ramen the character's name is he sal
i hope i'm saying it right
i'm sorry if i'm not and he is around 17 years old
it's just a simple three-quarter bust drawing like i mentioned
this is kind of a i
i want to say that he style is very cute and since he gets flustered i wanted to draw him blushing
i actually just went with the first oc i found in my email
there were a ton of gotcha character
submissions because i had just posted a gotcha character video at the time
and so i just went through my emails until i found an oc submission
and that's how i got this character
back to the tablet when i was setting up the tablet i did have to recalibrate the monitor
the monitor did help a lot with the mouse cursor
i clicked on the wrong thing because the cursor was in a slightly different spot than my mouse
this is a common thing for tablets to do
the current tablet
i use does the same thing
where around the edges
i started by applying the shadows and placed those where i wanted them
i then went around and added where i wanted the strands of hair to get some more light
i made these really strong at first
and then i toned it down
i feel like this gave the hair a really neat
look so this tablet is nice to work on
at first i thought working on the small of a tablet would be kind of troublesome
when it came to the size i was working at the pressure
sensitivity works very well and responds nicely
also the express keys are very easy to customize and work just fine for me
they didn't give me any issues
thankfully i also like how
the tablet doesn't take up very much space
i don't have a ton of desk space in my room
so the fact that this tablet is so tiny is kind of nice
it doesn't take up my entire desk
it just takes up a little portion of it
the film applied to the screen is also really nice
vk 1200 is 249.99 on amazon
i think this is a really reasonable price
for the tablet
so that makes it so
the tablet is much more portable
if you are looking for something less bulky you might want to consider this tablet
so how do i rate my experience with the vk 1200 i give it
4.5 out of 5 stars the reason
i'm not giving it a full
he was a lot of fun to draw
so let's check it out
this is the
Intuos it's a thin
Windows or on a Mac
these drawing tablets come in two sizes small and medium
what's the difference
where are my note
the small has a live area of six inches by 3.7 inches
the medium has a live area of eight point five by five point three inches the new
Intuos tablet comes in three colors black pistachio and berry cherry berry
I like the extra space that the medium gives me in the last generation
I use the small version
the small felt a little cramped at times
but if you're on a budget it definitely gets the job done
Hey look at this there shortcut keys along the top
you can map these to any keyboard shortcut
your heart desires having the keys along
the top isn't quite as practical as say having them along the side like the intros
Pro has you wind up reaching one hand over the other hand
that's drawing
it's a little bit awkward since even the medium is really thin and compact
no problem because it's been in light
it's super easy to take with you
I was a little bit worried when I first pulled it out of the package
I thought it might be too light and slide around on my desk
but it's got these little rubber grippy
the battery lasts a surprisingly long amount of time usually if
I use it for a few hours at a time
I'm only using 10 to 20% of the battery life okay there is one thing that I get really geeky about
a lot of tablets say hey it feels like paper
that's marketing speak for
this feels nothing like paper
Intuos line when we're talking about digital drawing
this is my favorite surface to draw and it just feels right
it's the perfect amount of texture
not too much not too little
it almost feels like it has a rubbery edge to it
let's take a look at this pen
it's got four thousand levels of pressure sensitivity
they are calling it a 4 K pen instead of saying it has 4096 levels of pressure
well it has a good initial activation rate apply
a little bit of pressure gets wider at a consistent rate it is a very smooth feeling pen
same with brushes to change opacity and get darker as you apply more pressure
it's very smooth
diagonal line test
looks good
there are no jitters check and if you're traveling with it
the pen fits snugly into the little loop
that's at the top of the tablet
what's that you want
spare nibs we
you're in luck tucked into the back of the new pen
the pen has a little bit more weight to it than the old pen did
it's still pretty light but I think the old one was a little too light
it's also a little narrower than a lot of the styluses that come with other tablets
I got used to it but I still think
it takes a little bit of time for your eyes to adjust to looking at the screen
while you're drawing over here also use it as a mouse
when it comes to setting up the software and the drivers it was very smooth
I didn't run into any problems at all
I also liked the settings in their software
I've used a lot of third-party devices over the last couple years
I have a dual monitor setup
I use the tablet on both screens as a mouse
replacement if your pen is mapped to both screens
at the same time
it could be a little awkward to draw with things can feel smooshed
usually this requires you to go into the settings and say hey
flash animate whatever that program is called now huge time-saver
it's probably one of those things
it's hard to describe what I'm doing but if you know what I'm talking about you're like hey
that's pretty cool
so what are the drawbacks of the new intros
when I first got everything installed things were a little bit quirky
I couldn't find it
I haven't really run into that problem
so nothing huge and it also looks like
if you're giving the small it's about $80 now that you can get something for about half that price
it's not quite as good but it gets the job done really what
Wacom is usually going for is trying to be the best out there
so you're paying for the quality you're paying for that good
feel when you draw on the tablet
you're paying for those better drivers as far as price
the starting price for the small is a little higher than it used to be like
this gets a little confusing so
I'll try to sort it out here
the small without bluetooth
you can choose one of these two programs these small with bluetooth
you can choose two of these three programs
the medium version comes with all three
if you're drawing comics or manga or a line art
that thing is phenomenal
let me know down below in the comment section
we'll see kind of on the edge of that one
got a lot of bit of work to do still but that's all
I've got for now
I'll see you guys in a couple of days

with good value put into the product
Fire HD 10 and has a rubber bumper
that's pretty important with children
the 2 year warranty is there to ensure if any accidents do happen
you can get a replacement
so it's recommended for slightly older children
it comes with a 10.1
that provides amazing viewing angles and bright colors
it's a pretty good display for watching
even for adults it also has a microSD slot to expand your storage up to 256 gigabytes
it has front and back camera
VGA and 2 megapixel respectively
being a solid camera for children to interact with battery
this is a pretty safe choice
this tablet is as I said a 7-inch tablet it does has have a resistive touch screen
it's not capacitive so you do need to push down and use your fingernail to move through the device
it also does come with a stylus that you can use it
I said 800 by 480 resolution screen the viewing angles are ok not the greatest
not not not great not iPad quality or Samsung quality
but not horrible
either one thing
you may notice about this device as far as the body goes
this is the same as the
Augen 10 Touch 78 these are the same exact body
they've just done a little changes on them one of the things
I do like that
let's go over
what's on the outside of the device
first this is
headphone two mini USB
and your power
your power jack
this is a host and on the go
I did try keyboard and mouse with and they
they did work
so that's kind of nice
that was something that was promised on the
Augen jente and did not work on the back of the device
if you have problems your power button and your menu button
I find very annoying
one of the big differences as far as this device goes to the
Augen gen touch this
they both have 256 megabytes ram they both had two gigabyte of internal flash memory
they both had both have
SD card mini SD card up to 16 gigabyte
but this has a one gigahertz processor
it is an armed 11 processor like the Augen gent us but the Augen was only running at 600
as far as that scoring goes this scores a 198 so this device is not a powerhouse by any means
would you'd like to have on a tablet so that's kind of an issue
let's go over kind of the
UI on it
it does come with kind of a little overlay here
it's not bad it doesn't really slow the device down or anything like that it's pretty usable like
I said it has your home button volume up volume down menu back
button shows your Wi-Fi your battery your time
there is a little camera
what you think would mean
takes a picture of your screen that's useful for developers but for the everyday person
I don't really find a need for that
it's kind of a weird feature to have
what you have to actually do
UI weather calendar clock
you just press the button for the apps this is all
I reader for books
YouTube file manager settings and Wi-Fi settings
that's how you'll use this browser
it's relatively speedy you know it's the typical 2.1
you know two point two
obviously it would be faster with the improvements
they made there possibly could be an update
I did update my device when I did receive it an issue that I now have is
there is some talk that a Black Friday Toys R Us will have this device for 139
so it's gonna be you know on sale for a very cheap price
the question for most people is
is it worth it
I don't think it's horrible
there are some issues that need to be worked out in this to my personal device
I obviously can't install any apps so there's a big problem
there and the reboot is not saving
information is also an issue but for what it can do it does do it nice
you can obviously sideload apps if you know anything about
Android out here
you can try sideloading some of your apps on here
I was able to put it launcher pro on here before I did that
update and was able to put apps on the device and launcher / work fine
I'm just some video here this is Buck Bunny
this is 720p actually runs
pretty good looks pretty nice
so that's not really a big issue
the speaker doesn't have the greatest of sound headphones
have probably sound a lot better
but it's nice to the device at least can handle this so
I could see maybe for you know a younger child
you know for 139 this is a great little
Android device to give them that
you're not spending too much money
it's nothing compared of to the to the Samsung Galaxy Tab at you
know $5.99 so you can go back
this is the media center
there's a you know to listen to music
I don't think it's the perfect device and at that price
hopefully that will be fine but with a firmware that
I have on it
things are not going well so hopefully
maybe they'll have more updates and that'll be good this is Chris Garcia with my tablet life
comm and this was a review of the Sylvania seven-inch mini tablet
before we get into the video man
make sure y'all like come in and subscribe to my lair man and it's gonna be a good video man
I hope this video helped you
I hope a hope
y'all make up your mind about buying it
I'll write with it if you write with it
let's do it if you don't that's cool

I love the tablet like I said
I have to cut the car off and cut it back on and then they'd be straight it reconnect

I think I need to update it
I have updated in a minute which I see the little mussed and pop up right there
that camera automatically pop up just like any other car so you good with that and there be it man
hi this is
I'm doing a review of the who yawn wh1 4:09 tablet
I'll also be testing
this tablet out by creating a character design from a mood board
if you want to see the unboxing
now that we have that out of the way let's get started first of all
I'd like to start out by mentioning a little something about the drawing
I'm working on
I found a mood board on Pinterest and decided to create a character based on that mood board
so I'm gonna do a few sketches and some character exploration
this entire speed painting was created with this
Huyen tablet while doing these sketches
I made a list of pros and cons
felt the tablet
so we're gonna start out with the pros
this tablet has a ton of customizable buttons
there are so many buttons that
I didn't know what to program them all to so what I did was the eyedropper tool the brush
tool undo redo and flip canvas
those are the things that I use the most
I thought it would be very convenient to have them on the little buttons
a drawing surface on this tablet is huge
I was super surprised to see that
this tablet is 8100 - which is great
it's the same as the tablet that I currently use so there is no difference there
I'd have to say my favorite part about using this tablet was sketching
it felt very natural with that level of pin pressure
almost like you are using a pencil you can use
this tablet wired or wirelessly is really nice
I looked through the entire box and I was like am I crazy
did they not include it
what's going on
but it was underneath the tablet above all the customizable buttons there is an LED display
where it shows you if your
the price is insanely good
I was surprised to look up
the retail value of this tablet and it is 159
US dollars which is crazy
tablets are expensive compared to other tablets
like that's a wonderful price
I tried to find a comparable
is this one but the closest one
this isn't too big of an inconvenience since you can
I don't know how long the battery life is on the pin
I didn't have batteries but I know it would be pretty annoying if you went to go draw and it died
it's really not a super big deal
my current tablet
I do not have to charge the pin
I guess the technology is different
but it's just one thing
you know go back to the old way that
I used to do it and you know play with the sliders in Photoshop
it's almost like playing an instrument the way
I put my left hand on the tablet
I have a certain like hand position that I use and it comes very naturally to me so not having it
the easiest way to do it without the touch ring is to click one of the buttons on the pin
and it'll bring up the brush settings menu right next to where your cursor is
time's that being said had
I not had a certain way of working with my usual tablet
this would be an amazing option for me
the pros absolutely outweigh the cons
I highly recommend this option and for the price
you really cannot beat it
I hope you guys enjoyed watching the speed painting I did using this
Huyen tablet if you found this review helpful
please leave a like and subscribe to the channel
thanks for watching and I'll talk to you in the next video bye
hey what does happen
everyone welcome back to another video and yes at this point
I think it is safe to say that it is tableau week so without further ado
let's get right to it so today
we have the jumper each book six plus and this is yet another
it's nothing special
it's comes in this foam piece right here
which inside you'll find
the tablet and the charging adapter that runs at 12 volts 2 amps
that has this type of connection on the front
we got a badly pre-installed screen protector
so let's go ahead and take it off
it's full of bubbles and dust particles right under it and it seems like it's a pretty good script
ouch but not only that it's a screen protector
that is pretty easy to scratch up so once again
this is a 1080p 11.6 inch IPS panel and on the front
now yes the tablet does have some pretty thick bezels
so we don't block your screen when watching your video or reading a document
three fingers are usually out of the way on the front
we got a front facing camera and on the back we actually have just a black blob
there's actually no back camera but not like you're gonna be using that anyways
it's actually pretty good
it faces you very well no overall
I think it works pretty well
who knows maybe we'll see that in the extra vision on the bottom
we get the magnetic dock for the optional keyboard that we'll be taking a look at in just a bit
and on the right side you'll find a full-size
USB port a micro HDMI port and the charging port
on to the left side we got the volume rockers
and that's all you get for this tablet
getting in the way of the keyboard you can easily disable it with a single key
oh they're having to do some finger
acrobatics the keys
have some pretty decent travel distance which actually feels pretty good
the spacing on their hand is a bit too tight
so it'll take some time to get used to when typing on this keyboard
here's what it sounds like
and finally this is how it clips on it basically clips on with the magnetic dock on the bottom
and there you go
and here are these speeds
it could be better
three speeds are pretty okay for an EMC storage
but that's that so
it does boot up things to launch pretty quickly
and not only that
it's actually a single band
2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi networks so to put it simply
we don't have five gigahertz
that's something like this is missing from a tablet and you can see right here
of course it's 2.4 gigahertz
it's gonna be a huge bottleneck
we can say that it is running
at 1600 megahertz
now all
so let's go ahead and do that all right so at this point
and what do you know it just connected someone just messaged me on
all right here we go so we are getting about 78 77 T 1 FPS 70 FPS
and we are finally online now
it may disconnect at any point
I'm not too sure so
Rhyno burning at 720p lowest settings
if you're doing competitive gaming
just simply forget it
it's gonna run terribly like 12 of PS
I've tried it just some old games
half-life game source games and retro games
and what do you know the
Wi-Fi has disconnected again
now it shows it is connected but the connection is simply not there
nothing is going through so so
let's see if we can actually run anything here see if we can play anything
yep depending on what you connect to these
so now we're are running at 4k and anything below
4 K obviously is gonna run at full speed and right
now what's not running at full speed is of course the Wi-Fi because we're connected to 2.4
maybe you can get an
Ethernet cable and we'll talk about
what is the best alternative to this thing right here
now taking a quick look back at the display here
although has some pretty good viewing angles and overall it looks pretty good
it does have some major light bleed issues and you can see in the bottom right corner
it's very visible on a black canvas or a black display
in my opinion
that's some very severe back
land bleed now speaking of the display here
we can actually use a stylus pen
basically what I have in my hands here is a tech glass stylus pen now
now does it work
well it actually works fairly well and it's very responsive which is surprising and
and should you get it
well first
uh strictly the pros and cons first of all the display here overall
it does look pretty nice
it's pretty big
it's got a 1080p resolution it's IPS and overall the colors
which is a good thing
it's actually pretty small
it's not a whole lot
and it's actually very minimal
considering what other tablets can do the only way you can charge
we only have 2.4 gigahertz
it's actually quite disappointing
lastly performance forward the CPU is
it's pretty ok
it's not that bad
I haven't talked about yet
is actually a better life so a better life here
we can get 4 hours and 20 minutes of video playback at 1080p full brightness using VLC
it's a local file
I recommend this tablet definitely not
you've probably already guessed it
that is left only puny and 3450
it has the old band
I probably don't recommend getting it
Hi this is Travis with POSGuys.com.
Today we're taking a look at Pioneer's latest tablet all-in-one computer.
This is the Dash
T3, this is the third generation of the Dash tablet.
The previous Dash tablet was a 7
For this display
I have it paired with a couple matching peripherals.
So tablet and all-in-one computer, all in one.
This is their advanced base, so it has power built into it, it also has two USB ports.
Standard magnetic stripe reader is built into the side for doing old mag stripe type processing.
A standard base without USB ports, or a wall mounting option.
that tightens down.
For information on the Dash T3 tablet, please visit us at POSGuys.com. Thanks!
hi everyone welcome back to the channel
i'm carlos and uh i have a problem i have a welcome
cintiq 22 inch hd touch and
i have an xp pen
22 inch second generation
my problem is now
but i'm also going to talk to you guys about how you can win this very tablet
so let's get into it but first and welcome back so like i said before the intro
we're going to go ahead and take a look at this xp pen 22 inch second generation
i gave one of these away last year
and they've made some really cool improvements to this version
so we're going to take a look at the outside
meaning we're going to look at the connections
what you need to connect this to the computer
yes this is one of the kinds of drawing tablets that you need a computer to run this device on
i know that they have some
i don't know if xp pen has any that actually runs its own operating system
so first
what we're going to do is take a look at the outside
then we can take a look at some of the extras
one of the things i like about this
xp pen is the build quality
they did a really good job putting this thing together
there's not a lot of fanciness
i love the fact that it's super clean right now
well this comes with a stand that if i wanted to
i could take these four screws off and connect the back of the screen to my ergo arm and just
it's the same what i do like about this stand is this lever
here is very easy to get to even if you have
if you're looking at your screen like this all you have to do is put your hand in the middle
it's all very well put together and again
the second one is a usbc connection
which is the next connection here
and there's another connection up at the very top that is for headphones
so that's the outside
we had the cover plate
we had all the cables
let's take a look at the other stuff that comes with your xp pen
that doesn't happen anymore
they actually went battery free which is incredibly cool
that stuff doesn't happen anymore
another thing that they did as far as the stylus goes
if you look at the cintiq stylus
it's got this rubber grip here
you got the rocker button here
and then it's got this flare towards the tip right
that is really good ergonomics
not quite as much if you take a look
one is also hard plastic but i actually found some felt hard felt
i'm assuming it's felt but it's more of a softer more grippy
almost like it feels almost like a cloth
when you're drawing the xp pen nib is pretty comfortable
i'm not 100 sure if you can change those out or not but they definitely this
this stylus definitely does feel a lot better
okay so let me let you in on the little secret with xp pen
xp pen understands that their products are on the affordable side of the spectrum
this is the stylus holder
so if i were to open this up
there's the stylus nice and safe
you can pull it out
and what's cool about this end here
so what you could do
so if i click the plus button here you see i have quicktime open
this pen is the pa
i'm not sure which one it is
but it's either the pa5 or the pa6
if i tap it it switches from brush to eraser and if i tap it again it goes back to brush
chances are that you just need to click that button again
it's happened to me a whole bunch of times
i thought maybe i broke something or maybe
the xp pen driver wasn't acting correctly
but what it was was i had the eraser instead of the brush
so feel free to click that again if your ink or your paint isn't being brought out okay
so down here on the left you can set the pressure sensitivity adjustments
i know that there's a lot of people that are really geeked out on this type of stuff
now we've taken a look at the back
we have it connected to the computer now
let's go ahead and see
which is pen tablet right
click go over to options open at login
you want to have this going so you
it's already running
by the time you go to be creative and now
let's take a look at drawing in photoshop with an xp pen
let's maybe draw see
i automatically the way i have my cintiq set up
i will say this is really responsive
they have done a much better job
at the first generation of this was kind of clunky to be honest
they've they've actually improved the drawing experience quite a bit i am
i'm pleased
i'm i'm excited that this is this much better drawing experience than i thought it would be
let's go to my other favorite drawing program
i like the combination of sketchbook and xp pen together
it's just a little bit but to be honest
their quality of product is incredible for example
i bought this one about five years ago for about twelve hundred dollars
i wish wacom had something like this
so you're looking at used
1200 brand new 600 or or you can get this one for free
all you have to do is make sure that you're subscribed to my channel
i'm going to pick a random comment out of the comments section of this video
i'll pick a random winner and then i'll send you this guy for free
i'll cover the shipping
if you win what i'll do is i'll go to instagram or twitter
and then get your address from there and then i'll take care of the rest
how's that sound
if you like this video please give it a thumbs up if you know anyone else
that's it for me you guys
Sonia came out the gate last year at MWC with their vision of a tablet
one that we really liked and deemed one of the best of 2013 now with their latest offering
Sony keeps things mostly as sleek as before but continues the evolution of the Xperia line
hey it's Josh of Gotham and or authority
what's going on everybody and this is a Sony
only much bigger
you'll see this notion permeate throughout the review but first
let's take a look at design in this 10-inch tablet
you'll find the dual speaker setup
always a welcome feature of a tablet experience one of the first things
and it makes this one of the thinnest and nimblest tablets
this is a good change from the rigid corners of the original end
I'll say the bezel around the screen you are able to grip the tablet pretty easily
so you might find yourself throwing this tablet around like
you get the same advantages on this much
Sony's own enhancements of the live color LED which adds extra colors to the already established
I found no reason to fault
backed by the audrina 330 and three gigabytes of RAM provide the sheer power
I did see from time to time
that really broke my experience or make it tough to get what I needed done
however and when gaming
they do get pretty loud
I did like that
the tablet is able to perform the same noise canceling as the smartphone
but my unit did not come with the headphones that are needed for that to happen
life is supported by a lot of power saving features but also that's 6,000 milliamp hour unit
within what kind of struck me the most about this tablet was well
it's standby time
its five days before
cameras on tablets are always a bit tough to give big recommendations to primarily
you can't use the full resolution if you want to be able to shoot at 16 by 9
at which point you will have to use 5 megapixels instead picture quality thus is passable at best
you won't get anything from this camera that rivals the smartphone
that's maybe sitting on the table in front of you
what has always been at least to me a success of the Xperia UI is that well
it doesn't really try too hard and like
I always say when you keep it simple you keep it fast
Sony's very stylized take on Android
interfaces you pull down on the left and get a look at your notifications and then on the right
you can get the quick settings that are editable
that go over your workspace for quick multitasking
Sony's own media market called unlimited and it has a stage along with PlayStation mobile
Play Store once again
iterations out there so you can get the Sony
Xperia z2 tablet for about $550 on online retailers and that is a premium price
but in a way you can argue that you get what you pay for
so if you're gonna pay the premium price for this tablet right here it's probably because of
Samsung does put into its tablets
well then you do still have one of the best median consumption devices here after all
Sony is entry into the tablet game started over a year ago
Sony TV in your hand with all of the power of the Xperia z2 smartphone
you really do have something special
and that is definitely what the z2 tablet feels like
I said I’m done with reviews, and I am, but there is one tablet
I never talked about that I should.
The tablet I paid for.
The one I reinstalled after every single product review.
The one I drew on almost every day for five years.
When you have a tablet that long you learn some interesting things a review won’t cover.
When I started an art business I invested in a Wacom Cintiq 27QHD Touch.
Yes these tablets are expensive, but again, this is a business for me.
I wanted a tablet I wouldn’t have to replace for years.
That’s what I paid for.
That’s what I got.
End of 2019
Wacom sent me a Cintiq
Pro 24, which is what I’ve been using daily ever since.
Did they tell me to make a review?
No. Am I doing one anyway?
Yes. First of all, the old 27QHD, too big.
24 is the perfect size.
I had the option to try the 32” Pro but I wanted the 24”.
Speaking specifically as a 2D animator/illustrator there is a point where the tablet is too big.
What a dumb fool I was.
The monitor arm changed my life.
I can treat it like a second monitor.
I have desk space.
I can sit.
I can stand.
I can literally dance while I draw.
And I do.
It’s amazing. My setup makes using the physical keyboard awkward, but that’s my problem.
I never could get the hang of onscreen keyboards.
They’re too slow, not tactile.
I type like a shark going after a bloody steak.
Gotta feel the keys, put my teeth in that meat.
Digital keyboards, blech. Touch function, blech.
I always keep touch off.
I accidentally touch stuff with my palm when it’s on.
I haven’t tried any other monitor arms, but the official Wacom Flex monitor arm is heavy duty.
I could easily bash a hole in the wall with this thing.
Nope. Not a problem.
It’s not going anywhere.
And even a mechanically disinclined idiot like me can put this one together.
It’s just a C clamp.
I had to hack my desk because it didn’t have enough lip.
Oh yeah, don’t try to mount an arm on a piece of cardboard.
You need a decent desk.
I don’t how long ¾ inches of Ikea particle board will survive the toothy jaws of clampiness.
Especially with all 16 pounds of sheer animator muscle pushing down on the other end.
Uuuuuuuughhhhh Funny thing about the old 27 QHD.
My cat jumped on it and the screen didn’t get scratched.
I got a screen protector after that.
Not that it would do much against these devil claws of justice.
It does in fact matter.
You want to know what drove me nuts about the 27QHD?
Every day I had to turn it on and off again a couple times for it to sync to the right resolution.
For a while I had a Wacom driver where that problem stopped. It was heaven.
But then Windows updated and pitched us all back into the fiery pits of hell again.
Back in with the Mac users I guess.
The 24 Pro doesn’t do that.
I turn it on. It works.
Every time. Also interesting: after four years of use the 27QHD got the blues.
When I turned it on in the morning it took a couple minutes to fade in to regular colors.
And when it fell asleep, it woke up blue.
Had to turn it off and on again.
Magic. The magical tech support trick.
Off and back on.
But you know what?
Oh boy, does it have a fan.
You’ll be drawing for two/three hours and then all of a sudden WHHHHHHHHHHRRRRR.
Gosh I’m so sensitive to noise I just ugh.
Agh! It’s so loud!
Why is its fan so loud! It won’t simply stay off or on.
It cycles every few seconds.
The fan was such a big complaint that Wacom made a firmware update that allows you to change
speeds in display settings > advanced.
Once I changed that the fan behaved.
Pro is defunct.
Right side, check.
Left side, slippery slope.
That remote didn’t fall.
Is this a problem with the receiver inside my Cintiq Pro?
Is it a driver issue?
Is it Toon Boom?
It could be anything.
Someday I’ll get ticked enough to dismount the tablet and look.
But not today. Not yet.
Maybe the driver will update.
I’m always hoping for a driver
update that fixes one problem and causes another.
Fingers crossed: my old remote has been working fine without disconnecting for four months now.
So yep, must’ve been a driver issue.
Both tablets do the thing where it says
low battery warning for no reason.
Does this happen to anyone else, or is it just me?
Oddly, whenever that box pops up is when the tablet bugs out.
The 27QHD used to require a power off and on when this box appeared. The 24 doesn’t.
The 24 chugs along despite the fake battery warning.
I suspect driver issues.
I always suspect the driver issues.
Fresh installs, rekeying shortcuts by hand
because the preference file itself gets corrupted, so restoring from a backup wouldn’t work.
If I’m having a weird issue, reinstalling the drivers works 95% of the time.
By the way driver nonsense after updates is absolutely not unique to Wacom.
programs, or niche programs like
Moho, or heck, even a simple internet browser.
All I’m saying is do your research.
Be sure you can plug what you’re getting into your computer or laptop.
Find out if the tablet works in your drawing program before you buy.
The Cintiq Pro is 4k. Oh yes. Ohhhhh yes. I’m happy.
The Pro pen recognizes 8,000 levels instead of the old beast’s 2,000.
Smooth. Smooooooooth.
I tried one of the pens
that has three buttons.
I thought that would be cool.
But it came in the box and that’s what I like, okay? Overall impressions.
The 27QHD is a quiet T-rex.
hello you lovely lot and welcome to a new video today
I have another tablet review for you
sorry for having to tablet reviews back to back
I did intend to have another video in between but then I didn't do that so today
I'm reviewing the XP pen star g9 6 0 which is the first XP pen tablet
I've tried so I was very excited to give it a go
I received this for free and I haven't been paid to say anything positive if I like it
I will say so if I don't like it I'll say so
hopefully you know how it goes by now
you get it from so that makes it an extremely well priced tablet and one of the cheapest
I think it's a fennec fox
which mean that you can use this tablet with different devices such as Android phones and tablets
this just allows me to compare each tablet fairly without wondering if any problems
I encounter the problem of the tablet or the computer within the XP pen software
so as you know
it's thin but it doesn't feel flimsy or like it's gonna snap it's about the same depth as my iPad
the edges are not beveled which is unusual compared to most of the other tablets
I've tried but you do feel uncomfortable
actually really like the design
it's very simple
no bells or whistles very plain but I just really liked it
one potential issue
I'm thinking this tablet is probably more made for use with laptops
I found the pen for this tablet
quite unusual is very thin
here's the usual comparison with my
there is a loop on the end
I don't know what that's for
I don't know if I'm missing something or being stupid but I'm not sure what that's for
it also doesn't have an eraser which may be a point of note for people who may use an eraser a lot
there is a button on the pen which you can change the function of
this pen is that it doesn't have a battery and it doesn't need recharging
nib felt quite sturdy
it didn't feel like it was wobbling around whereas with some other cheaper brands
I've used the pen
nib kind of felt unsteady
but this one felt pretty solid
another note is that there's no pen holder either separately or on the tablet itself
it didn't have anything which means you could potentially lose your pen easily again
as that makes sense
the starti 9:6 are also comes with four shortcut keys
which as mentioned you can have on either side of the tablet
you can even have the tablet in portrait format if you want
there's an option for it
I didn't try that because I don't have the space for it
that's actually very loud
so for example
they were very easy to use though
I found them easy to set up with the appropriate shortcuts
they wanted and I set mine to undo to open the tablet software
I left it on the default sensitivity settings to familiarize myself with them
the surface has a subtle green which feels fairly paper
like it's not so smooth that the pen will slide around but it doesn't catch up either
it doesn't stay clean for long and it does tend to show fingerprints but also
I use a lot of hand cream especially in the winter so that might be partly down to me
the tablet worked thoughtlessly with both of them
however as a point
I would say that you might have issues if you have
Windows ink turned on
I was really pleasantly surprised with this tablet
I reviewed I've given them away afterwards
my laptop has issues with the trackpad
so it'll help me navigate better and in case
I ever want to draw or do any video editing on the laptop then
I would definitely recommend this as a tablet for a beginner to digital ah like
the setup was simple
it comes with a nice variety of accessories which mean it can be used on
Android phones and tablets and not just your computer and it performed consistently well
it's very cheap
it feels fairly solid
the setup was simple and I found no overall hiccups I using it
it's simple straightforward and genuinely nice to use
I was really pleasantly surprised
I can't round off a video without talking about the character
I'm drawing and I will be doing a full video about them as part of my D&D series
but in the meantime this is my huffing fighter
they recently leveled up to eldritch night and have been having a great time casting the light
Tantra and leading the way through the woods with a glow-in-the-dark Warhammer I loved Rita bits
there's so much fun to play and I'm really happy with how this painting came out
I stole a long way to go
it was digital painting but I feel like I'm learning something new with every attempt
please let me know if you have any questions
about this tablet
you can find links in the description below non-affiliated
I don't earn any money from them
but if you want to check them out please do
who knows better
start swearing a lot
so they know
my channel isn't for kids
I'm kidding anyway
thank you so much for the support
I hope you enjoyed the video
thank you so much for supporting my content and enjoying what
I do hope you enjoyed the video and I will see you in 2020 bye
now I know a lot of you guys are probably saying something like wow snow ler snads
I can't believe you are a sellout or something and well yes
I was a messaged by someone from gaomon
I'm probably butchering that name
I'm really sorry
and so they said to hate
could you review a tablet and this is odd since
I don't really have that much experience with tablets
I mean I researched this as much as I could
I'm probably not going to make too many of these unless you know you guys want me to
I thought it would just be something new to do while
I'm working on other things so yeah I guess we'll get on with the review
so this is the tablet it's a Gaga Galman PD 1560 Galman stands for Garfield and Odie Mondays
I guess I'll start off with all the cables he get because you get a lot of cables
it's not as complicated as it looks but you know you got you got your input thingies your
I mean sorry
this is output
they'll take up a lot of room next
it comes with this stand of sorts
and you got like it's pretty smooth
you got a lot of notches and such
here's the mechanism
you just pull this thing
it seems to work pretty well
it's sturdy you also come with the pen
of course the stylus
I think that's what's called
you got this you got this plug got the USB in this thing it works pretty well
and that's that's not even a joke so moving on to the actual tablet
I hope that I really need to get like a better camera
okay here we go so onto them onto the actual tablet
we have some power on buttons some menu buttons
all of that
you also see these uh buttons on the side
I guess I could find a way to like use these I might
there might be other functions
we have all the things like the work area the
About section the stylist settings the key settings and as you can see the function works pretty
the pen itself will like disconnect for a little bit that might be my computer or the tablet
I don't know so right now
we're making black spaghetti and I'm just showing you the curvatures and so far
it's it's pretty pretty nice
it's there's very little lag
I also forgot to mention that
so what this tablet does is essentially
take your computer screen and just put it on the tablet like your mouse works as a normal
I don't know why that is is kind of odd
so yeah it works on the internet and everything else so
I asked you guys on Twitter
what should I draw with my new tablet and what program should I use
and of course mspaint is winning so here we have some suggestions a painting of Bob
Ross painting a picture of Bob Ross painting a sonic OC
that seems a little bit complicated for what we're doing but let's let's move on
Steven universe for we might do that this but don't actually okay draw this
it's already a drawing
why would I draw it again
this this is a anti-lgbt
Sid the Science Kid I guess I
I'm just gonna do this by memory because why not so
everyone knows that a good bore picture always starts with a an enormous circle
so that's what we're gonna do
this is probably gonna be really sketchy cuz uh mspaint does not have layers
I know it's eyes are kinda like Squidward ish
I don't know what I'm going for here but uh just testing out basic functions
Steven universe has an afro right
for what do you expect wowee okay
let's let's keep going
of course we have to have the inside stomach view
let's see what should we put in the middle
Perl is pretty simple
she's like super thin
I forgot about that
let's just let's just make stick figures cuz
I can't be bothered to put too much detail in such a small space
let's line the stomach
well see then
I must I must say you look mighty scrumptious today
how are we gonna do the legs
I don't know I'm assuming he's like wearing pants
yes that that would be a good move
I must say that the line work does not have much to be desired in this one
no siree well
I'm so proud of myself
how are we gonna color the Sun
we have the fill tool
mmm that's some good stomach thing
let's just use basic colors for pearl
let's do combination uh
Steven universe he has like a red
I know they're pastel
like right
do you need
do you need any more convincing
do you need any more convincing
I mean look at this
do you think any any other tablet can create such a masterpiece
well this was
I don't really have any major problems with it
I'm not sure about price range
just really quick
I loved it so much
it really reminds me of vexes art
I mean not completely
I feel like he's got a bit of a different color scheme but I really like it it says
Pablo here on the front
I mean back in 2005
I got my first ever tablet and I was really young at the time and i 100% did not deserve it
it was a Wacom Intuos and not that any of that is the point
sensitivity is amazing
you get your
Quick Start Guide the warranty and return policy this glove that you wear while you draw
I personally don't use things like that but I know some artists do
I might check it out and try and see how it feels while drawing with this tablet today
I'm really excited to try this out
so let's go ahead and get started so one thing that's different from the tablet that I usually use
is that the other end of the pen is not usable
which is a little different for me
I want to turn it over
it's just making my fingers feel weird but who knows
maybe you'll like it if you're accustomed to it
I take my brush pen
I lighten my second sketch layer
I delete my first sketch layer because I no longer need that and then I start my liner and so far
this tablet has been really good
I'm genuinely impressed
I really traveled down this interesting route whole rabbit hole back in the day
trying to figure out you know
what is a tablet
I need back in
2005 like tablets weren't exactly heard of especially drawing tablets in particular
I should say I was very much impressionable at the time because you know
I assumed you always needed
I'm really impressed by that
drawing these stone edges pretty easy so
I've just about finished my liner and one thing I do want to mention as I was doing my line art
I did notice the fact that being that this is such a small tablet
my lines were kind of constricted
I guess would be the best word I could think of saying
usually some artists like to draw a lake with short strokes
I'm one of those artists that like to do
I'm going to go ahead and completely delete the under sketch that I still have
I was still able to use the tablet even though I do have longer strokes
this is her skin and this is her skin
this is your skin skin skin
this is her skin and it
but sometimes like right here sometimes
my lines aren't perfect so this is kind of minor usually
I have it happen a little bit bigger but it leaves gaps of uncolored areas
I just got tired of that and I was like
I'm just gonna fill it in by hand so it takes a little longer doing it by hand
my line art layer
so it'll be over top of everything and I can just add like this weird little gap
I definitely do think I like it a little bit more open
she doesn't look too serious and so right now
I'm using the Dodge tool
which if any of you guys have seen
Ross drawls he uses this tool a lot and I love it just to add touches of effects
I guess you could say particularly with her glowing tattoo
well no
they're not really tattoos
I can't really explain them
I don't like that one
I'm working on the hair
and so i zoom in to sort of get all the detail so like
yeah that works and then
there is a limit but much more than I could with traditional art
I'm not sure if I'm just accessing it wrong
I don't know if I don't know if it's me or if it's the program basically is what I'm getting at
I tried troubleshooting it
and for whatever reason
I'm so excited to have shown you
guys this tablet that has really thoroughly impressed me for $30.00
I think it did pretty fantastic
obviously some issues with the pen no eraser
the size is a little bit small but but other than that
thanks guys bye
hey everyone so today
I want to give a review of the Wacom tablets specifically for photographers
this one's pretty nice and we also have the intuos pro
this one's really fancy so this is gonna be the last you see of any boxes
sorry no boring unboxing videos for you
Wacom one and I had never even heard of this one
it's super cheap and it's like 60 bucks
it's a really good entry option
this thing is tiny
it's great for travel
it's just super simple
I really like this for someone just getting started out and then we have the Wacom Intuos
I'll end up going with so this is just kind of mid sized very nice quality
it's got four programmable buttons so it makes it really nice to use versus
but the so you can see the difference here but this with a the
this is a really nice tablet
it is quite big
it's very large compared to the other ones
but this is really meant to be used in your office and really not yet to be taken anywhere
I'll think it's much heavier so it has a really good feel to it
it doesn't work particularly well for that
I don't know if you can see that
I notice no lag at all
maybe a newer one would work
that has faster
Windows but my Mac
I've had no problem at all so this one else has a touch setting
it turned off because usually my hand ends up
activating it when
I don't want it to so I've just turned that off it
I think it's mini-usb so it's kind of the older style of connection
the one model is only available in
they didn't have the wireless time at the time that
so if you're gonna be traveling with these
I travel a full time in an RV
so portability is really important for me
I do tend to work in odd places like libraries and stuff at times
so how about sometimes really portable is nice
the one is gonna be the most portable one although the Intuos is pretty much the same
so it's kind of a toss-up between those two again
they just a slightly different size
I feel like they're pretty much the same weight so they both would work
well for portability again
this little cloth strap here so that you can actually keep your pin to your tablet
so that's this really nice metal base and you use that on your desk to hold it so really simple
just nice to have so again
the pro really developed to be used on a desktop and not to be taken travel with you
because it's just a really beefy
it feels great in your hand and just the positioning of it and everything just feels amazing
it's really comfortable
it does have a eraser on the other end
that feel really nice
but really this one just feels amazing
I think it's like 70 bucks so not something I would do
it has kind of a rubbery surface to it
it's not a really nice thick rubber like their pro one
the pro mods actually kind of squishy
this one is just kind of like a little bit sticky so
it's totally usable
so you can see it
also has two buttons one long one short and a slight texture on them
there's a good feel to it
there's barely a flange on it
it's very skinny very light and just has no
it doesn't have a good feel to it and the buttons are kind of this cheap plastic key
clicky feeling it's it feels cheap
it doesn't feel comfortable in your hand
so this probably won't show up on video but just the feeling of this
it feels smooth as butter
it's just
I just love using this one and then the Intuos feels pretty nice
it's a little bit noisier
it's just a different feeling so
I don't know if we'll be able to hear this
but here's the pro and here is the into us
I've never had any problem with it
disconnecting it's worked fantastically
Wireless so I'm really impressed with that
I don't know if the Intuos works the same
that's one thing
so the battery life seems to be really good so
so you just click this plus button here to add a specific applications
you have shortcuts just for that application so then under pin for this bottom button what
so it's a really easy way to get exactly the brush that you want now the other thing
I did with the top button
I set this to a keystroke to come out a keyboard and keystroke what I did was
turns it into the zoom tool so now
two options makes it super easy to get around so some settings
you should know about in photoshop up here
I'm in the brush tool you can see here and in the options bar
there's these two icons one here and one here so this one tells
Photoshop that you should change the opacity based upon the pressure
so let me
just turn these two settings off so
I'm sure what they do
it feels more like using a mouse
there's nothing too special about it so rather than do that
so that's useful but where
based upon how hard address we keep the same opacity
so it's really gonna depend on what you're trying to do but most of the time
I just leave both of these on so that it's the pressure
sensitivity is controlling the size
I was going to show you how these tablets work differently
Photoshop is photographers
then you have a different pressure
sensitive is become a lot more important but for photographers
it's really easy to do
not exactly what I want
I like to leave both of them on
so now let's say
I want to darken or the sky so I could flip this to black and you can see in this case
let me make this a lot bigger so now
I kind of paint that in
let me make that smaller
I just did that by holding down the bottom button on it pen and you know
I don't have very good control with this
I usually combine this using my TK panel to create luminosity masks
is assigning one of your function buttons to the spacebar so
I think I programmed one of these
I forget which one it does and okay so that allows you
I mean everywhere
whenever you hold down the spacebar it turns into the pan tool
it's like this bottom button here
brings up this
there's lots you can do with this and like
I said you can zoom with this
scroll wheel on the pro version but you can see
it's a little clunky
it just does this jerky zooming by a large amount
and it doesn't zoom where you want it to
it's just going to zoom to the center of damage so
I don't use that so it's not that great of a feature
maybe there's some other use for it but I haven't found anything yet
it's just a little bit too jerky all right so now
let's talk about what size of tablet we need so all of these that
I would say most people just need the small size
there will be some exceptions to that but especially if you just have one screen
so wherever you put your pen
Photoshop is only going to be this
the entire tablet to one screen when
I'm using Photoshop so what I've done here is
I've set up a custom application for Photoshop
and then under mapping what
I've done is I've set it to be just two monitor
two which is what
I'm using Photoshop
I can use my entire thing for both screens
I don't think it really matters
I would probably recommend getting the medium size
and if you have a giant monitor like 30 inches or bigger
then you might consider getting a medium-size tablet
they're huge so
I really wouldn't recommend that unless you absolutely have to
so and you might think well bigger is better right always like it gives you more precision
I found the small to be just fine
I think all right so I hope you guys enjoyed this review
I had lot of fun making it
I know that having a tablet has really transformed the way that I process my photos
it just makes it so much more fun and intuitive to just use a pen instead of having the clunky
Mouse so I highly recommend one and the Wacom tablets are just awesome quality
any of them that you get are gonna be great so if you like this
hey folks Tyler Allen here illustrator concept artist and instructor today
I got in the gallon
one as 620 graphics tablet pad
Galman website itself
you can purchase it in various regions
it does seem to be like right off the bat
it just has this this kind of nice presentation about it so finally breaking the seal on this
alright everything's kind of laid out in here pretty accordingly
you get a few registration cards right which is fairly typical for a product like this
yeah let's check out the actual build quality of this and the overall size so see
it's a fairly small very lightweight tablet
I do like that
initial surface texture
coming in here for a bit of a closer look
here's the black artists glove the USB cable the multi-language instruction manual the pen
now in the nice little soft case but yeah
I thought this was pretty cool
I haven't got one of these tablets
let yet that just you know innately come with a little case for it
this is a battery for you
pen it's slightly thinner than my usual into s1
it's got four
Express keys up here at the top again
a very nice surface texture over with that very impressed with at least how it feels so folks
there's a few other features
I want to point out here depending on the type of user
now there's really only a few ways you can use these things right one of them
is you put it on a desk draw it
I can't exactly test the duration of that
I can say that this connection right here on the for the actual USB is very sturdy very strong
it's not going to be popping out and that's a problem
I have had with
the workspace gives a bit of information
we can set the fan
it has a lot of these basic features
I usually like to do in addition to maybe like the right mouse button
nothing's really happening
I don't know if it will let me allow it to program at that
it's letting me do numbered keys or our letter keys
rather you know backspace no shift or no no kind of actual function keys
so that's interesting now for the work area
I was also getting interesting results with this as well
so right now it's set to my first display but what
I can't actually use this like a traditional mousepad when it's on that other display
there's a little bit of finicky nough sand
I hit the right click option
which of course brings up my brush list here that I can use to draw so what I often like to do
let's try getting a brush
that's got a lot of thick thickness and angle adjustments to see
what kind of options so yeah
I can build things up all these normal settings so this is a brush
it's not functioning so giving the just the technical limitations of a tablet like this
I'm thumb drawing just simple shapes too rough and I'd probably use it
you know in that instance but yeah
there's just a lot of other tablets on the market that suit my needs better
you know who is this for it
well if you're on a budget you know it's gonna get you by fine
it's definitely better than a traditional mousepad for sure if you're an Android user
it's probably gonna be for you as well as you
can you get a lot more functionality
on the go of it so see
this is just a great little drawing
I like to figure out and plan a lot of these lines
I like a screen a drawing like a Cintiq
it is harder to kind of go back in terms of tech but yeah this is fine
I see people playing like Sue Gideon Solid Edge and stuff
they seem to really like it
yeah on a sketch like this
I'm keeping a lot of my layers kind of separate so I can plan this out
and and of course the beauty of this is
it's probably gonna be something
Japanese inspired but either way the beauty of it is I will get to
I hope this was informative for you and take care
I'll see you next time
the joy 11 was a decent hybrid laptop its entry level specs provide sufficient power for users
who merely wants to use it
just like every new device the joy 11 gets preceded by a new successor
it now comes with an updated spec sheet and a totally new design
but is it any better
i'm warren for kl gadget tv and this is the review of the 2017 joy 11.
i clearly understand the decision to make this product
feel a little premium with the metal build but statically
it feels tiring
to hold the device for long durations and it could be a little compact without those bezels
well here's the new no joy 11.
i'll let you be the judge to comment
which one looks better okay
so let's get to the hardware specifications
inch ips
active pen stylus
i have been given a week to try out the joy 11 with the metal keyboard
dock the good news is the dock takes power from the tablet and it can even power up
external hard drives this round but these usb ports only work on usb 2.0 speeds
the metal keyboard unfortunately doesn't offer a great typing experience with its flat keys
the trackpad uses windows drivers and it is extremely steep to press on
i suggest that you purchase the ladder keyboard cover instead of the metal keyboard
and that is if you can do away with two full-size usb ports performance wise
the new joy 11 isn't significantly faster than its predecessor
despite using a faster processor with more
transfer speeds and also not all apps in windows can run on a secondary storage device
the joy 11 delivers 5 hours of continuous use just like its predecessor
the 2017 joy 11 is still a very convenient device to own despite of its shortcomings
it is priced at 899 ringgit while its keyboard dock and the joy
active pen is sold separately
i highly recommend the latter keyboard
cover that is priced at 199
because they capitalized the e at the end you know
the one edgy
I gave myself about a six out of ten
Here I am reviewing the Galman and 10k 2018 tablet before we get into this
Mons request if you want to check them out cool cool
let's do it so this is the gal maan em 10 K 2018 graphic tablet
it's got white in a shiny gold
look at that it's beautiful
it's great nice
presentation makes me feel special
I haven't really seen on other tablets before
but we're gonna get more into that later
let's go inside
we got a drawstring begi to hide all your secrets go in the sack
you're going in the sack everybody next
we're gonna poke at the side thing and pull out the cord
here's the USB that goes into the computer and here's the one that goes into the tablet
it's uh that's it next
I got this nice little pouch
nice little fabric
I'm not gonna open all that I'm just I'm gonna put it back
I do like the little pouch though
it's like a secret secret knife pouch
yeah tell us that okay
let's look at the pen for this again
it's in a neat
little pouch for slimmer knives
I assume look at that
that's a nice looking pen
it's got the buttons on it
it's it's pretty light
it's got this little knob you on it that you could put things in or maybe we're on a chain
let's just put this on uh-huh yeah now
you can look edgy and cool disclaimer
probably not as cool
it's easy to install
I've had other tablets that I have to mess around for 45 minutes to find this
I don't use a lot of pen pressure
you know when it comes to lines
I like I'm thick
unique is the little circle button on the side
I did get it to work on Photoshop and newer programs
the tablet itself is pretty light yet sturdy
I dropped it down the stairs for science and here guys and it came out
okay the things
there are probably ways to fix this
the one thing that really annoyed me was the lack of support for older programs
it didn't even give me the not responding or closing of the program
would you like to save it
just flat out disappeared
it's a very decent tablet and pretty standard
I don't know what that means but neither do you
probably not gonna do it again
this is kind of painful
what somebody's and gentlemen
welcome back this videos
Bharti gets by thank you
and we're taking a look at the matrix pad s 30 now
this is full-on 10-inch octa-core tablet and it runs
Android 9.0 Pi
so what exactly makes this so cool
there is almost no lag on top of that
so you're pretty much set to go
it also supports basic things that a lot of
Cheaper tablets don't support for example has an octa-core processor it
can you can actually connect your 5g network instead of just your two point four
G network and of course it also has a up to 128 gigabytes of external memory
storage as well
which makes things really really cool now my day-to-day
I got around like five and a half hours of viewing you know like full-on videos gaming
maybe I got like three hours
then browsing the web is where it's shown it basically was allowed to
it was able to give me almost like 13 hours of just browsing the web total and lastly
it looks really really premium
it just feels nice in your hand
it's weighted very well and on top of that supports things like GPS and it has very loud speakers
you guys enjoyed this video
if so leave a like and don't forget to subscribe then guys for watching
this is going to be me logging on
what's up guys
Sebastian here from noble fugu studio
this is the artist 12
Pro from XP fen
he sent it over in exchange for reviews over the past week
entry-level pen display
I highly recommend getting on with the screen if you can afford it anyhow
let's see what the artist 12
Pro has brought to the market specs wise
we've a fully laminated 1080p
that lifts a tablet 20 degrees off of any surface on paper
let's see how my week went with this tablet
let's start with this tablet excels in my opinion that would be the laminated display
drawing on
the pressure sensing is responsive
had no issues with it really one thing
I do wish is that these pens were just a tad on the heavier side
I'm not really keen on putting to use but for what it is
it works nicely one thing
and you don't want a lot of it when it comes to drawing digitally to illustrate further
they work as they're supposed to nothing really to mention here
they're responsive they feel nice
the customization is great
because you can set up your own macros
this thing is made completely out of plastic which makes it very easy to carry
in this design
it looks pretty cool
I can't say the same however for the stand like I mentioned earlier
but my back and my neck hurt when
I'm trying to use this device at this angle
the stand is not great
moving on to the setup of this tablet
that go into your computer and finally you power
USB that goes into an outlet and here is what the finished setup looks like
I personally have no problems with this because I do most of my work on my desk
if you can get all the other wires hidden and make your setup look really clean besides the stand
I'm going to be completely transparent here
I seriously enjoy drawing on the artist
12 Pro the laminated screen is easy to draw on the button and dial interface
the performance of this device
impressed me so much that
that's how nice drawing on this device really is now while the pen display is nice
I will admit that I am disappointed
I can say with the clean conscience that I recommend buying this tablet
thank you guys for watching
my hope is that this review helped you to make a decision
on which tablet
you're going to invest in either
it be this one or another one my hope that
I could help you out by just sharing my experience
also a huge thank you to XP Penn for sending this thing over
I look forward to doing more reviews like this one in the future

let's review my product
hello everybody JD
from red water came here today to talk about the 27-inch kids tablet
you know people in my apartment so but you know it will powered by Android
I mean
my camera is not
don't catch any of that that's okay
Android go edition
it is while it's turning on it is none okay
you did
the idea hottie
there does so here
is the cute little loading screen but you get the gist
and even when the tablet is on silent that still goes on and
this tablet you know
just turn it on before you need to do that
um overall using it it was it's great to use
it's a good size its handheld
it's this this comes on and off
so if you need to disinfect this and clean it off entirely for your kids
that's entirely possible
also you can see all of thee
I have elected to use it for myself um you know I mean
I haven't noticed any lad or anything when I'm playing with the apps on this tablet which is nice
I've played with a few other tablets made for kids before
sometimes they're a little laggy because it's not like they're very hydrate
Ablett's but this one does keep up and it holds
its own even with all of the fun games on it oh
I'll go over the apps in one second let me
just the last thing is that the battery life is about
if you're reading just reading
play ten hours of reading so um depending on what you plan to do with it
that's really not bad
keep in mind
keep in mind if you do plan to buy this tablet follow the rules of its in the instruction booklet
the battery only lasted about half an hour and I thought that there was something heavily
we're on with it and I was upset um but by for some reason the third full States hour charge
I don't know I don't know if it was just like a weird lit
I don't know if that was just some weird glitch in the one I was using
some of these are mine
sorry you can see my decorations help over there
but and then there's a whole little story that goes with it and it's just absolutely adorable so
I think that if oh it is designed for children 3 to 8 which I should have mentioned earlier
so you can split it up
accordingly some other ones are ABC world basically learning your ABCs
geometry - it came with which is a fun kids
this is very grippy
there's no kid stand or anything that it comes with but it does
it's easy to hold this grip you know like even if
I just hold it like this
it's not it doesn't slide very easily and like
I said I really like that
you can just simply take it off and just you know
I like that big fan of that
the camera quality mediocre
cute adorable little kids tablet
I'm saying so basically it works
you have to do all this complicated steps to get out of the child
lock in order to access the rest of the tablet so I can confirm by
I was locking myself out of all the other apps that it works
it didn't help you
it's a good good option and good safety
so that's pretty much it link to it below
thank you so much for watching and please subscribe to the Dryden water YouTube channel thank you
hello gamers so today
we're doing something a little different
which in this case is an unboxing
hey do you want to review one of our products
so you know what sure
why not they were kind enough
the tablet itself the stylus pen the cord for it
what i didn't expect was a little bag for you to place the tablet in
that's actually the first time i've ever seen that
they threw in a glove and of course it came with the tips
now here's something about tablets with buttons
i just wanted to see how the tablet would look in that little bag for a moment
okay so this is going to mainly be unscripted because i want my true feelings to be expressed
so this tablet does it draw
well does it run
well honestly
don't worry if it looks like i'm struggling
that's just my drawing process
something i do have to say about it is when it came to the buttons on the side
i will say that something i like about
this tablet is just how wide it is
uh definitely wouldn't be the best option for those of you who prefer something light
so here's the big question
what about the price
well the price of this tablet is 75 bucks so you know
it's not the cheapest tablet but here's the thing
that didn't even come with any fancy buttons so to think that i could have had something like this
which is 75 bucks a lot less than what i originally paid for my first tablet
it saddens me but at the same time makes me glad
it's sleek looking
it's nice it runs
well it runs fast and it's at a good price but that's really all i have to say about it
i mean it is a tablet
what else can you really explore in short tablet's pretty good
thank you to gaomon for sending me it and i really hope this whole time
i've been pronouncing their company name right
oh wait i have one more thing to say about this
i don't know why that bothers me so much but it does okay really now
that is the end
i'll be seeing you later
gamers thank you very much to galamond you

thank you mom central bye
christmas is fast approaching
and this could be the perfect gift for your child
hello nick here from technovo and welcome back to the channel today
i have this with me
it's the pebble gear frozen to a tablet
which has been specifically designed just for kids before we get into it though
2. the tablet features a seven inch touchscreen display
it's got a standard quad core processor
one gigabyte of ram 16 gigabyte of on-board storage and a 2 700 milliamp battery
they drop things all the time
i know this
my daughter smashed an ipad before which wasn't great for anyone with this tablet
you get a thick rubber case which protects the tablet from bumps and falls
and if you dropped it on a flat surface like your floor
the screen itself should be protected as the case sits proud at the front for this
very reason it's not indestructible
if the screen got caught on a sharp corner a table
perhaps then there could be damage behind the bumper
case is your typical 7 inch tablet which includes both front and rear cameras a single speaker
it's nothing special in appearance but the bumper case is nice
it's okay and it's priced to reflect that
the screen resolution is alright at 10 24 by 600 with 159 dpi and the screen is responsive enough
she found it easy to navigate
the buttons on screen are big
and i have to say
they're pretty good upon initial setup
the shortest duration to play can be set to five minutes
i like the idea of my eldest
which apps have been used and when etc which is quite helpful
pebble is calling it game store junior
the first year is completely free
an eight-year-old spends 500 pounds on gold or gems
well that won't happen here
i'm pleasantly surprised
our apps are available too as i thought they may be unknown rubbish games
pac-man racing being one of them which ran perfectly fine and i really enjoyed playing it
the other feature being an e-reader works well too
we sat there and read a number of stories together with bright colorful pictures
and it was great
i really like this
it does what it's meant to do
keep the kids entertained as a treat or a reward i like the disney affiliation
i like that
i don't need to worry about ads and random purchases within games and i like the parental controls
i'm in two minds as to whether i want the ability to play video content
it would be good but i do like the idea that this is purely a games
that's a wrap on this video if you've stuck around then thank you very much
hey guys what's going on it's on here from
Nova spirit Eggman today
we're gonna be checking out this little tiny 7 inch laptop or tablet
well it's called pika going
it could do both solid
let's get started now
I want to thank pika girl for sending me over this review unit
they actually have a campaign going on right now which
now it's not a super impressive
CPU BAU elaborate more on that
that's the only differences there
otherwise it's pretty much the same so one of the biggest features you might have noticed about
this is the screen
I'm at 150 which gives me a little bit more
desktop real estate back another thing you might have noticed
it's got almost like a full keyboard that you could type from
here's another feature
why they say it might be a tablet
keyboards are disabled
you could press it all day long
and it's not going to change other than me you know flipping it back and forth
total weight of
this guy is about a cup of coffee
megapixel which is 640 by 480
I mean it's it's a really low resolution you could probably get away with using Skype on it
it offers to mic ports on the top and speaker ports in front which
like you put on a better or something like that or your lap
you can't hear a thing
it won't even take it only takes up to three amps
you actually have a little slot here that you can stick in your
SIM card one of the things I had to get used to was that it has no scroll bars yeah
I first using this
typing on
this guy was very very easy
it does take a little bit of getting used to where the space bar is
because the mouse left/right click is right there
I was able to type at normal
speed loading programs are pretty quick if I'm gonna load up word or something like that
it just works even though you might think
it's a weaker cpu
it's made for stuff like this so it actually works really well like
I said as far as typing wise
this is typing whoops test
it's not hard at all once you get used to it what
I did find a problem was with the right-click it's I mean
the backslash the backslash was a little bit hard to find because I'm used to using those screen
brightness is actually not a problem actually
don't even keep it that bright but you are able to use it outdoors if you need to
and other than the fact that the screen could flip backwards and turned into a tablet
this guy has no fans it is virtually quiet the heat you could see
I really like about this guy I gotta say I loved it
little light work now
Reddit or stuff like that
this thing works really well in those conditions especially loading up
Excel or Word
it doesn't have a problem
this thing is great because like to bring around if you really need to type like what
I would do to type in IP addresses or typing
come in and stuff like that
it is very very useful a couple of features that
I do like about this
is that when you flip it backwards
I could read this like a tablet
I could actually scroll we go through
read it go through whatever
I'm no stranger to this CPU and also like mini laptops
I have a bunch of them and I'm a huge fan of ultra mobile pcs
it was very very hard like
I thought this guy will replace it
this is the GDP win and also the GDP win -
it is a weaker
CPU but for my use cases I rather like it on the CPU and yes can I do with a better CPU
what what can you know the
so it's a give or take on those situations
can i play any games on this anything that's 2011 and before probably but
I don't think you would really want to play games on this guy anyway
that's what your desktop and maybe a gaming laptop is for is the price for this guy reasonable
yes absolutely because of the screen
this screen is gorgeous compared to all the other ones
I've ever used and there's absolutely no doubt that I would pay for the pro tax
probably not if you're more towards traveling yours
you need remote administration
you need to check emails all the time
and you're not really too stressed out about like playing games or anything
this thing is great

check this out is the new
XP pen artist 12 pen display a cute little entry-level drawing tablet
I'm not gonna like it
I really wasn't taking it all that seriously
hey don't feel bad little guy
the artist 12 is a pen display
this is the smallest screen display of this kind
I've personally ever drawn on
the screen is 11.6 inches
it's not a laminated display
I was in no way surprised by this fourth price point
I really expected this now on a Wacom you can get that on an iPad Android tablet
you're gonna find that but right now only the hooey on 13 has a display like that
everything else is just like this one
those are really slick to draw on
to having a glossy err screen like this is colors do tend to be crisper
that's pretty standard for displays in this kind of price range in you get used to it
there's even a touch slider in the middle of those express keys
that too is customizable
there are preset settings for this
it's nice to have not every display
it has a little slide bar like this
it's not quite as sensitive as some of the other touch pads
I've used swiping a lot
changes my brush size just a little or just Scrolls a little it just zooms a little
I wish it was a little more sensitive also
the default mapping on the brushes at least is backwards for example swiping down
I would expect to make my brushes smaller but in this case it makes my brushes bigger
usually it's the other way around so it took some time to reverse that in my brain
what's that you want me to tell them
what's in the box
it's all combined into one
which makes it a little easier to move around
you're also gonna find your power adapter
then you're gonna get the pen you're also gonna get a pen holder that can do its own fancy things
I think that about covers it
expeed pen also sent me a stand
it's their standard stand that they tend to send out with these drawing displays
it's nothing special
but it's solid
it's light easy to move around
hold your display in place really well
it also doesn't come with the tablet itself
you have to buy it extra
I've also said this in other videos but I'll say it again closes pretty fast
so what's your finger
what you got there
oh the pen we got to talk about this little guy okay short version on the pen it is really good
the pen feels incredibly smooth
it's not uncommon for me to turn on a little bit of a stroke straightener when
I'm drawing this inktober illustration that
I'm working on that
you've seen me drawing in the background
I am using Photoshop and I do not have the stroke straightener on
I just didn't need it
this is a battery free pen
it has 8,192 levels of pressure
sensitivity also has a clickable button along this side it's customizable and also indented
that's just not something you see much on non
thanks to the flat sided
hexagonal design
yes I googled the word hexagonal for this review
let's go to the drawing test
straight angled lines look good when drawn by hand
they look better when you draw them with the ruler
I did pick up a tiny bit away but it's really one of the best pens
I look for because I do a lot of ink line work so I want a crisp clean line
I don't want jitter
I don't want waves
I want it to be nice smooth at any angle and this pen pulls that off
I also found that drawing really lightly with it produces a line
it's got a very good initial activation rate holding pressure
really well around curves so
I did nothing here as soon as I installed it
I drew my first line and I got excited because it felt so good
this 12 inch form factor
pretty quickly kind of reminded me of drawing on the iPad
I can pull it off my desk
set it on my lap
I did have to move the cord around a little bit but it was long enough where I could do that
so what are the cons of a device like this like
I said before there is some parallax
that's the difference between where your pen tip is
and where the cursor appears on your screen below it also the slider on the side like
I said before that could be more responsive and the other thing would be
is this some folks looking for hotspots on their displays
place it on the screen that just get kind of warm after using it for a while
this one has one along the bottom where your hand rest but the good news here is
it's not really a hot spot
good it's all I've got for today
thank you guys for watching and I'll see you in a couple of days
i'm glad y'all could join us today

let's see how that sounds
let's see oh my god look at that screen anyway

somebody should left that on there
the glove is so that was yeah
good thinking on your own stuff check out that you got some buttons
let me bring this in a little closer
so you guys can check this out
you got some buttons on it up here
i think you got power
we got hdm hdmi out
so i'll know the next time
okay and look we got this thing in the back let me put
let me come back over here
this is for
i'm thinking this stand okay
all right so it goes in there and it'll stand from what i'm from what i heard
it'll stand by itself so you can draw on it
okay just these let out these legs
no they're not legs
okay anyway
we got that part out of the way
okay the on
this is the 20 inch by the way this is the 28
this is the one that was 9.99
when it first came out i think 9.99
yeah okay now
let's get back to the pen and check this pin
this is not a regular pen
it's a special pen you know
it's a digital pin so it don't look like your average pin you don't want to damage the pin
the pin is everything okay
i don't know if you can back order these if you
okay anyway
oh look at that look at the pants
zoom in on that
get that man
oh man oh it's got two buttons on it
i figure one is for line and one is for erase
that's just my guess
i'm an artist
so i'm thinking yeah it's a great deal
it feels good
there's nothing up here okay
but a sensor probably for the heron itself
yeah this is a good device
i don't know i know quality
i've been dying quality for the last three or four years
okay yeah man
come on maybe i should lay that on the screen
okay and we're gonna have this thing put all together
let's see what comes in this box
here let me open this up
let's see what we got here
okay now we got the screws
that was smart
we got the screws to screw that device
and screw this into the back of that and i think this lifts up
oh that's how i just helped so we flipped this over the back side
you can also use this as a tv to look at movies you can hook it up to your computer
you can use it as a second monitor if you want to however
i doubt you would spend that much money just to use it for that but you could
hey okay let's see what else is in the box
this is a 22
i don't know what those and you guys can leave that in the comments too
if you know what i'm talking about all right most laptops run out of like the same power
this is the hdmi
it comes in the box standard hdmi
i figured this is to hook up to your tv or whatever you can hook this thing up to like
i said your computer or anything
now this baffles me
i don't know this is a mystery
what would this be for
oh my god oh you know what this is for duh
don't tell nobody if i'm not mistaken
this is a design
oh my god if this is not for this you guys that's got one of these already
leave it in the comments below what it's really for because i have no idea
oh my god we got another chord in here too
oh this is the chord you use to hook this to your computer and actually use it
okay this is a standard vga display
vga out yeah
yeah man it comes they pack this good so you get basically the pin one
that's crazy yeah we don't you got to go
don't go find a screwdriver
you don't even have to go do that
they see you give you one and i like that man
i like that because some people don't give you nothing to do
you got to go around the house
this thing draws this thing man i've seen people draw and i'm an artist good artists
i've seen people draw stuff on here that beyond you know you
i'm glad they
i was wondering where the screws were that i ain't gonna even like him man
i was running with the cruiser
i know we got some screws somewhere but i wasn't seeing them
hey you're wrong okay and let me let you guys know in in our next video
we're going to do a bonus video out here
they got a tactical laser
tag out there
so we're gonna go out there and be filming you know taking a look at the tactical laser cat tag
they also have a retro arcade in the building
the falling alley's cool man
you know but sometimes you want to get it in head to head
who knows what they got out there
you'll find out friday evening when we go out there and interview these guys personally
yes yes in your in your community
so that's gonna be it for this unboxing when we come back
we've also got an octa-core processor running up to 1.5 gigahertz it's an IPS panel
I won't be talking to you about the cameras in this video
don't perform that great they're acceptable
I don't see many people using them
so it's enough talk about the cameras
we're not going to talk about that anymore
and we start by just turning this around so you can see the screen thirteen point three inches
wow this is a really good screen
I thought to myself
the place where they've saved a lot of money is normally on the screen
let's be fair
you know
normally you buy maybe one of these larger tablets from Amazon or Ebay
maybe it's an import from another country and the screen is not that great on this
I'm very very impressed
so let's just take a look in the app drawer
so that's a little bit of a disappointment
I'm not sure how well this will be supported for future upgrades
I've been testing works absolutely fine
it's a very very good performance
this size is really enjoyable
it's really good fun so
I really appreciated that what I've really enjoyed though is watching back some videos
and that's purely because the screen is a really nice or color
something also noticed is why holding the tablet
you've got a nice sort of smooth sort of gradation to the angle on this
really nice and smooth and comfortable to hold and then this side here is quite angular
and that's because we've got a full array of ports so across this side we have got a reset switch
we also got microSD card slots you can expand the memory
we've got micro
well what more can
let's put it that way
this is a fantastic choice
I think that they've done a really good job on this
there's slightly different tone
it does also click dust a little bit more
let's just take one more look at the screen
now obviously we have got a 13.3
inch screen here with that full
HD resolution we have got quite large bezels but again I think that was a good design choice
maybe this top bezel and the bottom bezel could have been a tiny tiny bit smaller but
if you check out the links down in the video description area you can see
just how much of a bargain this is
this is the hannspree
Titan 2 if you're looking for a really large screen Google Android tablet
this is well worth checking out
thank you very much for watching
I really do appreciate it as always if you liked the video

Hello again and welcome to yet
another product review.
This is the Vankyo MatrixPad S20, and the MatrixPad S21.
So what’s the difference, and why is the S21 priced lower than the S20?
In this video
and which tablet may be right for you.
So stay tuned that’s up next.
So I’m back and inside both boxes
the contents are the same.
You get the tablet itself.
One USB charging cable.
A 5V 2A amps DC power adapter.
And your user’s manuals and gift card.
So let’s now have a look at their design, button placement, and ports.
So here I have both tablets lined up equally alongside each other, and what you will notice
is that the new
Both models come with a 10.1 inch ISP display, and has a 1280 x 800 resolution.
Both models come with a front facing 5MP camera.
To the top of both models you have Type C charging ports, however on the S20
So I’m back and here I have both tablets the S20 is on the left and S21 on the right.
Both models come with 32GB of internal storage, and Bluetooth 5.0 support.
which means it can run a 64 bit applications.
Both models have dual band AC 2.4 + 5 GHz Wi-Fi support.
The operating system of both models is Android 9 pie, and both models are not rooted.
And both models have the exact number codex and decoders to play HD 1080p videos.
So in this comparison the only difference is that the S20 comes with 3GB of RAM and S21 has 2GB.
So that’s it for system and hardware information.
Let’s now compare the Antutu benchmark scores of both models.
The S20 has an Antutu score of 97,451, and the S21 got a score of 96,225.
So the S20 outperforming the S 21 x 1200 points.
I will now test the responsiveness of both models.
To test their entertainment features
I installed Netflix directly from the Google
play store on both models.
It’s the official version with Chromecast, and here you can see
I have the same video open on both tablets.
Both models come with the mobile version of YouTube and they can only play up to 720p resolution.
Here is some sample footage from both models using their rear facing 8MP cameras.
The video quality is the same as expected seeing that they both carry the same hardware.
The S21 however is slightly larger than the S20 and cost much less.
So if you’re on a budget the S21 might be the right choice.
And if you’re looking for a budget tablet with slightly better performance and hardware
S20 is the better of the two.
So have come to the end of my review.
Thanks goes out the Vankyo for sending these two tablets for review.
Links to both models can be found in the description directly below this video.
Give this video the thumbs up
Stay tuned and I’ll be seeing you in the next one.
so hi it's sible
this is a little weird for me but i thought i'd try to do a voiceover for this video
it's my first time doing one
so um if i sound a little bit awkward
it's because i don't know what i'm doing today
i know that's not my usual content
i originally wanted to have a danganronpa speedpaint in between them
but i had to send my tablet in for a pair and i ended up losing the recording files
i also didn't have my tablet on hand to work on it because it was getting repaired
it's because i'm currently in the process of unexpectedly moving
okay sorry for all that exposition
let's get into the actual unboxing and review
i'll also put a screenshot of them as well
as a screenshot of the items you can expect to find inside
this tablet is a lot smaller than i'm used to
it's only 11.6 inches diagonally so it was an adjustment for me
but that definitely makes it portable if you're someone who likes to draw on the go
the tablet came with a shiny film over it to protect the screen
there's actually a matte screen protector
i took it off
the colors improved significantly
uh so it's up to you
there was a noticeable
the tablet also came with the user manual and the glove
i think the glove that i currently use with my wacom tablet is actually my old galman glove
um i'm an idiot and forgot to do this so i'll just be using my own stand
the tablet has eight express keys for shortcuts
they make a pretty satisfying clicking
sound when you press them
i really didn't have any issues with setup
the cords are long enough to be flexible with where they went
there are buttons on the side of the tablet to adjust brightness and color
it's a little bit confusing
i believe and the auto button is used to go back in the menu
unfortunately the contrast on this tablet isn't the best
and it's one of my biggest critiques
about the tablet overall who is blasting their base outside
what the speaking of price government also wanted me to let you all know about a promotion
you'll get a 15 discount on their already marked on price
this would bring the tablet down to about 173 usd
i'll include links to the amazon listing in the description
i didn't experience much lag
between the cursor and pen i found it pretty comfortable to adjust to and draw with
there is some parallax as you can see here
the cursor doesn't quite line up with a pen nib
the tablet doesn't seem to support tilt either
when i tilt the pen the cursor moves very far away from the nip
i think this tablet is a great option for beginners on a budget
it can be used both as a flat pen
i don't have to move my hand as much to make larger strokes
if that makes any sense i wanted to work on a bigger piece in this video
thank you so much
uh hopefully i'll see you next time with a speed paint bye
there's a power cord in hdmi
use the pen itself is lightweight and very cylindrical
cylindrical god i did have an issue
initially whoa basically you just press the button
oh my god my dogs are fighting
um i forgot what i was in the middle of saying
yeah the cursor
right foreign blue camera a i-66 so i thought 64 security foreign like home
okay come on hello okay my okay yet
foreign foreign blue foreign pink tablet bye
hello everyone its Laurie and welcome back to a new video today
I'm doing a review of the XP pants RG 968 tablet
this tablet has got a surface of 8.30 5x5 point 33 inches
also including in the box
at the tablet it has got four customizable
the box includes different quick guides on how to install the driver to your computer
this is just smart phones and tablets which is also pretty cool
the driver was actually pretty easy
you can actually open this tab
which will show you different features of your pen
and your tablet you can customize the four
Express keys on your tablet
I did not do much
moving on to the speed pane part
I have to cut everything
and it's such a hassle but it's fine
I actually did another sketch of this drawing
it was the first sketch but I really didn't like how it turned out
just didn't have a lot of like flow and movement
it just didn't look how
I imagined it so I decided to sketch it again and I actually met my expectations
I guess you could say and I really like how it turned out so I went with it
I did struggle a bit this destroying not with the girl I really like
she turned out the whole concept about her hair
it's so much fun
it's also great practice to draw food because food is great so why not draw it too
I don't know and another thing that I struggled
which was the biggest struggle was the background
I had no idea what to do with the background
I asked some of my friends if they had any opinions and none of them really helped me
I didn't do anything
I just kept it as how it was originally
I still don't like the background
that's the only thing that bothers me about this drawing
I feel like it clashes a lot
let me know what you guys think about
the background should have done a different or should
I yeah or does it look fine how I left it
more about the tablet another thing that
I forgot to mention before
is that when you connect your tablet to your computer or laptop
it will blink a small white light which is on top of the 4x
press key a few times to know that the tablet is on
it's gonna be still white
oh just the light is gonna light
we'll never use the pen now
I really really like how this tablet works
it's pretty cool
it's completely comfortable because my last tablet was pretty big and it took a lot of space
it's really as big as my laptop keyboard
that's how big it was so
I really like the small size of this one
I guess you could say and also that I love the fact that this pen is battery free
I don't have to charge it
oh no my pen is gonna die then
that's a struggle so
I really like the fact about this pen
I did struggle a bit with the ten at first because this pen is very thin
I use pencils every day at school or when I draw traditionally so
I don't know why I'm struggling with this one
but it's kind of thin
it's kind of weird too old also because I have to click like the right
click on the pen so
I mean the tablet works but the cable is broken
it makes like it has a little problem connection
I don't know and my pen is also broken
I mean I got used to it because I have been using it since December
I recommend this tablet totally for anyone
yes it's great
it has everything that you need and it's very easy to install
it was my first time doing a review of a tablet so
I really hope that it was fine
and if you have any suggestions on how
I could make reviews more interesting
let me know in the comments down below
I would love to know that but yeah
I really hope you all enjoyed watching this video
I upload a new video
thank you all so much for watching once again
I love you and I'll see you all next time bye
hey everyone today i want to talk to you about the books nova 3 now
so that's something
a lot of people have questions about
let's look at the device itself
that is sort of a drawing of a seashell
we have a lot of different options over to the side including our library
the books reader which is built in is actually pretty good
the included
stylus is definitely a huge plus
it's also your notebook so as you can see it has pressure sensitivity
it supports the show
let me know in the comments
what you think about the books nova 3
be sure to give this video a thumbs up if it helped you in any way possible

Waring Tech you
what's going on guy is the CTA Prime back here again today
the 10 inch version
I have in
CPU GPU and ram but with the 10 inch
we get more screen real estate so if you need a bigger tablet
I would opt in for the 10 inch version inside of the box
we get the tablet
a user manual a micro USB cable and our power break this is 5 volts 2 amps
all of the ports and buttons are on the upper side of the tablet
we have our 3.5
millimeter audio jack micro
I actually didn't think there would be that much of a size difference between the two given
I think the closest competitors to these tablets are the Amazon fire branded tablets
and right here we have an Amazon 10
these come in at 150 dollars
but they go on sale for $99 all the time so keep your eye out on
the fire 10 is much more powerful
the screen is brighter higher resolution and just looks overall much better than the on version
plus the dual speakers built into the fire
and it's a base
Android there are five
and then we're gonna move into some benchmarks some native
now this is a low-end cpu
it's the same
CPU that Amazon uses in their fire
HD 8 the GPU is a Mallee t7 20 MP
2 this is a dual core
both cameras are absolute garbage like on most tablets
I said in my last video
this is probably reading ebooks
that's the only bloat on here so now it's time to test this tablet out
Walmart icon if we click on this
it's gonna open up all of the apps that are pre-installed
I am connected to my 5 gigahertz home network my home
Netflix or even Kodi I also ran a few benchmarks first up we have Geekbench Ford
beat them all out once again
moving over to some GPU benchmarks with 3dmark sling shot all of these
tablets are on the lower end of the android spectrum
there are cheaper phones out there
GPU benchmark was ice storm again
fire ten destroyed all three of these
let's take a look at some native
Android gameplay this is pub G I have all the settings lowered as much as possible
it's not as bad as I thought it would be
the tablet fits right in here
it holds it fine if you're interested in picking one of these controllers up
I will leave a link in the description to Amazon
they're about 27 bucks
I also tested out grand theft auto san andreas and they both run great
I did want to test the steam link app and it works great on this little tablet
I'm streaming project cars too from my main gaming PC
I got the settings maxed out here using the eye peg of 98 e3
it performs well especially with that
AC Wi-Fi built in I haven't set up so when I press select on my controller
it brings me back into the steam interface
not all games are gonna work great but well optimized games well like rampage
mario kart mario 64 i did test goldeneye at the lowest resolution
but it was still very laggy
there's a few other systems
that just aren't gonna work well on this hardware
like dreamcast n64 sega saturn
but if you want to go with some old stuff like sega genesis
SNES pc engine Game Boy Game Boy
Advance even d/s using drastic from the Google
Play Store works great
some other systems that work
great on this hardware are FD a neogeo game boy game boy color Mega Drive
32x game gear
your app of choice is here's
Cody playing a 1080p
video from the internal storage so overall
the 10 inch
version is only 15 dollars more than the 8 inch version
you get much more screen here and performance is going to be the same
it'd be really cool
if you could hit that like button
maybe subscribe to the channel but like always
thanks for watching you
hey everybody annex here today
I'm gonna be doing a review of the huion
campus pro 12 drawing tablet now
this drawing tablet is really good
in my opinion it's a great beginners tablet and it's also really good for advanced artists
if you want to improve your art so basically
you also get a little wipe you get this
thank you for treating humor and you get a warranty card in case it gets damaged and in my opinion
this tablet is great because you get a lot of space to draw on the drawing program
I use for this tablet personally
it's called fire alpaca 60
it looks like this little like alpaca
I always use 40
which makes it super smooth like
let's see how far behind the pen
it is which makes it a lot easier to draw on so
next up we have the M 106 k the professional graphics tablet
ooh this one is marked at 60 799
USD on Amazon
got your 2048 levels
ten by six point two five inches area five thousand eighty
LPI and 10 millimeter reading height
again you have more of the specs on the back of the box and now the unboxing here is the tablet
got the stylus pen
this one comes with a protective caps
so make sure to take that off before you draw this
little nice pouch is where
I hide my weed
this little nice pouch contains the extra nibs
QuickStart guide and the website for the drivers download
these are the cables
one is to connect the tablet and the other is to charge the stylus like the s 56k
this also has two programmable buttons
I was using the s 56k and I've now deleted that and installed the new driver for this tablet
m106 k and as you can see
there's a new interface for the tablet settings in this tab
we have the stylus pen settings my pressure sensitivity is at zero right now
that's how I like it no
I don't think I'll be changing that
and you could program the two buttons here right button
cam can be pretty much any key or any mouse button right now
it's on whatever default it is
I'm not really gonna change that right now
you have your keys and hotkeys
I mentioned that there were twelve additional buttons there
and for the keys
it's this one
let's say okay this one's also B
now let's change this one to tewi for example could take our control make it
II and my shortcuts are e4 erase and B for brush
so I'm not gonna apply and test that okay so II for this on okay
change to the erase tool and I'm gonna tap the one
I can go ahead and do that
going back to the tablet settings
if you go to the work area tab this will be similar to what
I mentioned in the s 56k with a full area in screen ratio
I recommend going into screen ratios
I'll draw something a little different so what I really like to do
in my animations is draw those really like detailed faces
I'll draw my head
is normal just kind of amar but this will just be a close-up of like my face
I guess kind of reminds me of those
those really crude close-ups in spongebob
but you know
I'm still not used to well
I've gotten too used to using the the monitor tablet so not looking directly at what
I'm drawing at and instead looking at a screen while I draw is pretty
uh it's kind of like reverting back because that is how
so here's the head
okay let's see
well what face should
I draw mmm
I like adding multiple
oh age yeah
it's pretty good
let's make my lips a little bit of color you know
I definitely feel way more accurate with with this pen or with this tablet
what is happening slowly drew my face
yeah that'll definitely make me look pretty tired pretty much as outlined these
I think these are what people call the panda eyes
this is the face of
I've seen some in my life that look of I've been through some stuff
almost achieving full tired full done mode should add some under the shadow under the lips
make these lips stick out a bit more perfectionist
okay oh god it's beautiful
it's beautiful okay
I don't even draw the eyebrows
it's that's how tired I am
just be like hey when you want
I'm tired yeah perfect awesome
alright that's yes okay turned out really good
I should use his face in the future animation
you know rough drawings and whatnot
this one is definitely fits
the name of the more professional drawing tablet
hey this
I still considered this one also portable
it's not flexible
like the s 56k but it fits easy in a bag
it's pretty much
it's it's a little bit smaller than the syntek
yeah similar dimensions
it's still fitting in my backpack with like a laptop and whatever
I'd say that's still pretty portable
you're good to go so whoa
what's my verdict on this tablet
ah thanks pretty good
I haven't really
I've only drawn with this for about a week
I only got to play with it for that long and I haven't found any problems as of yet
little shot trouble shot troubleshooted and their customer service is really great
so if you have any problems you can just bring it up to them
and they'll try to take care of any problems that you have definitely a good backup
if my tablet ends up you know not working someday this this will definitely save the day
this is definitely comparable to the different brands of this size
and this type of tablet
I personally haven't tried the Wacom Intuos or a lot of the different ones
thank you guys for watching
there's actually just so many competitive brands now which is great
it gives you more choices but there's also more choices that you have to make you know which
what's the difference between the different tablets
I mean to be honest
they're all pretty much kind of in the same boat
there's just little things here and there that you might not like
maybe it's the texture of the tablet but definitely
hi this is
it's a thin and light machine that has an Intel Core
i5 has well low-power processor a high-resolution display four gigs of ram 128 gigs of storage
believe this so you can see that it supports touchscreen gestures you can run desktop apps
it has a core i5
Haswell CPU like I mentioned
it's not the fastest
Haswell chip available but it's reasonably fast
headset jack
and that's for the power adapter speaker and volume buttons and the power button
is this little glowing
it's a little bit weird in laptop mode because it means that the power button is down here now
I haven't pointed out
the most unusual feature of this device yet is the keyboard
but you often wind up with these physical keys behind you here
there are no physical keys
you're not actually pushing down on anything
so my my hands tend to hurt for long periods of typing
has this touch sensitive unusual keyboard
that's good for typing out short items
I really like this device the keyboard
I'm not such a big fan of you can see
it's a backlit keyboard below it
it's just a keyboard that
I don't particularly love other interesting features
include a 2560 by 1440 pixels display and right now
you can adjust this
so let's see what happens when we go to smaller you notice
what that means is if we want to launch an application now this is what
YouTube looks like this is what little appearing looks like on an 11.6 inch display
I found that every now and again I'll sort of go to this middle ground
I've got handbrake open here
you can see some benchmarks at little appearing com not the fastest system
these actually look really tiny here though
these are the buttons for choosing your paint brushes and other settings and so
I find that is actually a little tricky to use on this because of the high resolution display
now that's not really Dells fault
they might not look great now desktop apps
I mean a tablet style apps or Windows 8 Store apps on the other hand
do look pretty good so you can see here
we've got the Netflix app
we're able to run two videos side by side
YouTube and Netflix
I've written a bunch of articles for lilliputian
I've edited some videos
I've done some other work on here and an overall performance wise
I have no complaints
it gets around six to seven hours of battery life
make sure to carry the charger with you
charger is reasonably compact
it's not quite cell phone charged or compact
this is the keyboard especially when you consider the price as I mentioned Dells says
well the keyboards not so much of an issue
gigs of ram
this configuration sells for $1,300
you can sometimes find it on sale for under 1200
that's a lot of money for a device that happens to be a tablet with a weird keyboard
I'd say especially when you consider that tablets
I mean it's nice to have these tablet functions
I don't even know what I'm trying to show you here
I'm sort of holding it on the table
I feel like it makes more sense to think of it as a laptop
that happens to work as a tablet when you occasionally wanted to
you can find more details that little appearing calm
fill this hole
let's find out the max
10 is made of smooth black plastic with rounded corners
the screen bezel is nicely
the top lip accommodates the camera in the micro sd slot to the left
the max 10 is slightly heavier than most expensive tablets
but you don't really notice the 926 grams of weight
whether you pick it up with one hand or hold it with two to watch a video
the display is difficult to read
we have a usb type-c port which doubles up to charge the max 10 slide
open a plastic flap to reveal the micro sd card reader for additional storage
at the bottom is where the speakers are positioned wireless
connectivity is taken care of with the dual band wi-fi 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz
that supports 802.11 ac it also has gps built-in and bluetooth 4.2
them sound is average and muted
it's a similar experience to something you find on a budget smartphone
at least there's a headphone jack or bluetooth to plug in your favorite earpiece
the max10 has a front 5 megapixel camera and an 8 megapixel rear camera
this is where the tablet shows its budget
status photos from either cameras are washed out or too dark
lack clarity and color accuracy
video recording is no better
the front camera is rated at 480p and the rear camera is 720p
here are some samples
i took from the two cameras
the dragon touch max
like word or excel with covid lockdown
and it is now a year later at the time of this review
i didn't find any performance or heat issues with playing any game in general
here's some gaming footage
10 tablet decent display for budget tablet
ok it's not brilliant outdoors but the majority of people will be using this inside useful battery
most people will find the battery life on the max
10 to be more than acceptable during testing with general
use the max
10 lasted a day on average shame
it didn't come with fast charging stock android
a pleasant surprise is the clean stock android 9
that comes with the max
the images come out washed down and color
accuracy is poor to add to this
the camera app is not intuitive
the performance is good enough to play most games on the play store
i wouldn't touch the camera except to call your friends
on zoom or teams premium tablets will offer thinner bezels lighter weight and a better quality
build if you don't want to pay extra for these features
the dragon touch max
10 is a worthy android tablet
what do you guys think
leave your comments and discuss below
hope you guys enjoyed the review of the dragon
touch max 10 tablet
thanks for watching cheers
what's up YouTube today
we're gonna talk about a budget tablet from the makers of Dragon touch the dragon touch m7
let's see what 60 bucks can really do stick around welcome back to
I miss reviews
so let's dig in a little bit first off
there's no need for an unboxing you get the tablet
here's our camera
here's a camera light
you have the dragon
touch logo looks like this could possibly be speaker and up top
you have a jack for headphones
this is a micro SD card slot for up to 128 gigabytes
get used to it play with it a bit
we already seen on the box
I can't stress this enough
there's no blow where that means a lot to me
pi so just to give you an idea about some of the hardware
it is not the best part but we'll see what it can do seven inches resolution 1024 by 600
you got a 1.5 gigahertz processor
it's a quad core so 1.5 times 4 got 2 gigabytes of ram ddr3
so get a little bit of information of what you can expect from this device
this is actually a pretty good little tablet
it's just slow
so the breakdown of the m7 hand or tablet all right
I'm gonna go with the negative first
the camera is really bad
you're not even gonna want to use it
it does have dual and it does work and you know you can make out
you can see the picture
it's just
that's pretty rad quality
but yeah it wouldn't wouldn't work with the flash so there's some grapes on the 3dmark
this is another negative
I did the slingshot benchmark test
I already did it so I'll just show you
the results got a 217
that's really low for those of you that know what all these numbers mean
I'll scroll through right here
your score is better than 13% of the results from all other devices
so that gives you an idea of where the hardware lies on this device now
I do have to admit it runs cool
that's that's pretty cool 19 degrees
Celsius frames per second 1 to 18 just for reference
it's just slow
Android PI it operating system
it runs pretty decent
actually it's just slow it works
well just slow um all right
well let's get into the good dough
pandora works great
Amazon music works great Amazon Kindle for e-books works great
the sound is a bit weird on this device like Samba
on some apps you can barely hear what's going on in on other ones
that sounds just fine
I think they could have added a couple watts
it's pretty cool
you do have to you know you have to pace yourself
this isn't really fast
that was really fast
so there's a Netflix and here's Prime
check out some originals
nice little interface watch now trailer
I had to watch last download share just to show you guys how fast it works
see not bad all right
let's check out who
Hulu actually runs a really nice on this machine
there you go
it's already started and last but not least
Disney Plus
let's see just to show you how long it takes to load see not bad
that's not a really fast tablet but it gets the job done sorry
I can't show you guys the video but I'll copyright protection and sorry about the video quality
this is what happens when you point a camera at a screen at least mine
I cannot get the ISO to look really nice but did the best
I could so about all that you know it
is that you know
it doesn't have any bloat where it has just enough apps on it when you first get it so you can run
Google and get the Play Store and that's pretty much it
I was curious about the graphics on this
I'm like I don't know about this benchmark test so I downloaded ashfall and surprisingly enough
it runs rather rather good you
it does take a long time to load up but once it's loaded up it runs great
you might see a little bit of glitching in the menus but once you hit start the race perfect see
how good this thing can work play
yeah you gotta love the soundtrack on his game too
I used to play this on the seal than that
I'm asking at all there
you can see
it's not glitchy in swim
it's got some issues between the camera
the older hardware and sometimes the sound can be a problem but at all honesty 60 bucks
I don't know seems like a pretty good deal pretty solid
I have a couple dragon touch devices and they've done me well
I got the I think it's called the k10
it's a 10 inch tablet
yeah it's it's it's done me
well it's it works great
it's actually quite quite fast
quick and snappy but this is a cheaper model and it does a lot for the price so well
I helped you out yeah if I did please like and subscribe and as always have a tech day you
this is tweet
hey what's up
i'm jason howell and i am here with the samsung galaxy tab 3 8.0
this is the 8 inch screen version
and you can kind of tell if you're a samsung fan at all
it looks a lot like the galaxy
s4 basically their you know their design
language is very very close to each other
be it the phones as well as the tablets they all look very similar
it has that 8 inch
LCD screen that I told you about its 1280 x 800 resolution
so it's not necessarily a full 1080p display
get to that in a second 16
gigs of internal storage on this device
although there is a 32 gig model microSD card slot
if you need even more than that
megapixels 4450 milliamp hour battery inside that is non-removable
so if that's a deal breaker for you you're not going to find it here
we'll start with the design
which kind of give it a nice little pop still a menu
button a capacitive menu button on the device
hey you know
that's that's going to be sufficient for most needs but I kind of saw it
like in the responsiveness
you can see the notification
pull down sometimes
it would take me two to three times to get it to register a touch in doing that other times
it would pull down fine it just really
I play dead trigger
the camera is almost not even really worth talking about and cameras on tablets
rarely ever amount to much but on here you get what
I would expect
you know pretty washed out photos unless you're an excellent punchy light
it's probably best suited for video conferencing battery
what more can I say solid performance
the battery didn't really run out on me although
certainly has its fans
that was really handy smart
it timeout settings are there is no gesture support on here
and that's something that you're looking for a little bit extra on the software side then
TouchWiz is excellent for that
all right
now let's take a look at the pros of the samsung galaxy tab 3 8.0 first
I would definitely say
and it's definitely a lot less than this tablet is so price is definitely an issue here
you're probably going to like this device for everyone else
tab 3 8.0
i'm jason howell and you can check out all of my reviews on all about android a twit TV / AAA
thanks for watching my review

it's easier what
I like about it
I can change my avatar and my wallpaper like this one to cat you got YouTube kids

it's just so much fun

thanks for watching bye
hey what's up guys tim here and i'm just here to review the hp elite x2 generation 4 tablet so
unfortunately uh magnetic charging was not a thing when this tablet came out
but the main reason why i chose this particular tablet was because of the thin thin bezels
which are available on a certain certain tablet uh size which is the 13 inch one
so i'll just um just open it up so i can show you guys
but um just wanted to to show you guys
this uh detachable keyboard as well um so the trackpad is really good quality
the keyboard itself is excellent as well
so this is actually a metal keyboard
the keyboard feels really good
it feels like a really high quality laptop keyboard and as i said before this is a a touch pad
it's a glass touch pad um and it actually feels um it actually feels really good
10 uh standard windows 10 tablet experience
and i've found um i found
excuse me uh especially considering it has a uh 3 000 by 2 000 pixel pixel display
these days are not certainly not as bright as some of the newer samsung phones
which only has a 1080p resolution but goes much brighter
um i'm not sure on the exact
um on the exact knits but i think it goes up to about 700 700
nits or so
if you get the 1080p version but um i went for the for the 4k um for the 4k
uh oh sorry 3k version um the reason
the resolution is a little bit odd 3000 by 2000
um is because it's it's not a 16 by nine um aspect ratio panel
it's actually uh slightly um slightly different slightly taller
um you can see that it's actually really thin
it's got a nice
um is because i've actually found no reviews online for for this tablet at all
it seems to be um quite a uh i guess
and that's why i think a lot of people don't know about it
so the hinge hinge is quite good
and right which is just just there volume up and down standard headphone jack
there always good the keyboard connector on the bottom and on the right side
it has three usbc ports
uh two of which
uh thunderbolt three uh compatible as well um on the back
this particular version is the spec out version
so it has a fingerprint reader as well
i prefer to use it flat to down on the desk like this
it's a metal metal design and looks
have it down on the desk like this and then and then you can use it
as far as as far as the tablet goes
i'm a little bit sad that hp hasn't refreshed this line
sometimes it's a little bit a little bit sluggish but it is
it is very thin very very thin laptop sometimes the fan comes on sometimes
so it was
it's a lot more expensive than the surface pro
um so that's how i've been operating lately
just um just off
the of of the spare sim card
the only other thing i'll mention is is battery life so battery
life's been a little bit poor to be honest
um and this this tablet i can get about probably maxes out at about three hours usage
it's it lasts for about three hours
it actually does last a lot longer
um doesn't um certainly doesn't live up to expectations and um unfortunately yeah it
it's got a um got a fairly standard um standard front camera fairly standard rear camera as well
probably nothing nothing to um nothing to ride home about um but i i do like the um i must say i
i do like the the back of the laptop
um it's um it it's all it's all metal and it feels
it does feel quite hefty
it just makes for really really quite a solid really quite a solid feeling tablet but anyway
that's my review of the hp elite x2
g4 i'll be uh posting this shortly online
um let me know in the comments
if you think any i should have done anything
uh differently for this
uh for this first product review
um i may have other products that uh that i'll be purchasing in the future
perhaps the new version of this tablet if hp makes a new version um but thanks for watching
i'll catch you guys next time
hey guys so in front of me
this is the latest dragon
touch max
10 tablet
now this tablet does come in two different versions
the original version has two gigabyte of ram
i wasn't really expecting much of it
so here's the box and everything that was inside
first of all we have our max
10 tablet looks very nice and feels very solid while holding in the hand next
we have a warranty card
this tablet actually comes with a two year warranty
just make sure you activate your warranty next
we have a very lengthy user manual
that shows you exactly how to work the max10 tablet
inside of here it runs off of android 9.0
pi and the screen display here is a ips full
now again it comes
in two different version this is the latest one that has three gigabytes of ram
it costs only about 10 more than the previous model with the two gig of ram
but right now this model is actually on sale for 15 off
i will leave a link to it in the description box down below so you can check it out for yourself
this is where both of your speaker is located one right here and another right here
it does support stereo music
this is where your microphone is actually located now on the right hand side right here
now on top of the tablet right here is where your usbc charging port is located and right here
you have this little removable tab
in the middle we have the 8 megapixel camera and in the middle
you have the dragon touch brand and that is pretty much it guys now
the body is supposedly made out of aluminum
you also have another camera built in into the front right here now
it changes the color of the screen that way it
it answered my question for me
hey google what day is it right now
it is friday july 24th 2020.
isn't that pretty awesome
i know a lot of people ask
we use it every single year
the love uh the kids love it and after five years guys everything still works perfectly
guys display is very clear actually
i was surprised of how clear it is for this tablet at such an affordable price
the audio of this tablet is not the loudest so actually kind of quiet
but it's typical for most tablet at this price range good thing is it does have a built-in 3.5
millimeter jack
that way
i have also downloaded several apps
right here uh games so let's go ahead and play some angry birds all right
i am not too good at games guys
but let's give this a try
looks like i did okay there
let's go to the next one
this game has been out for so long i think probably over 10 years now
i think i was playing this back in uh college
i didn't know people were still playing it today but obviously they are still playing
this is the latest version
all right so that's pretty easy and okay
let me try to shoot this guy
i think i just killed somebody
oh okay are you on my team or do i shoot you
come on okay
i died just like that okay
let's try this again again
this game is pretty fun guys
i'm just very bad at it okay
where's everybody oh oh oh come on come on
i got one
somebody's behind me
come on shoot him shoot him
oh wow i actually killed somebody
are you on my team
oh yeah he's my team so the red person is the one that's uh not on your team
oh oh what's going on here
oh whoa whoa
oh whoa whoa okay shoot him shoot him shoot him shoot shoot him shoot him shoot him
oh i reload too slow
okay hold on
this guy might shoot me so this guy's pretty sucks too
i thought i was bad
okay so that's call of duty and this is grand theft auto guys again
i'm horrible with games as well
what surprised me is
these games haven't been changed much
uh through the past over 10 years now
oh wow even got advertisements during the game but what i was saying is i'm surprised
these games have not changed much
even it's been over 10 years now back in the days
you can do a lot of gaming
there's some flower that's what it looks like on the tablet
that's what it looks like on my camera and again back to the tablet
now let me show you what the front camera look like
of course front camera does not look as good as the back camera but you can use it for some selfie
if you want so there we have some books as you can see right there
this is what the book looked like
and that's what the book looked like with the front camera of the tablet
that's my camera setup
so again front camera is not the best camera in the world
but it's there if you want to use it again guys overall
you have a reset hole so just put in like a toothpick or like earring
i believe i have shown you pretty much everything that this tablet can do
let me know your thoughts in the comment section below and i will see you all in the next video
hey guys today
i'm so excited to unbox this
new small and powerful deco mini 7 wireless
this is a new product from xp pen and the price is 59.9
first of all thanks to hun
he's a good friend of mine that sent me this product for review
here's the box
it is small and light
the packaging looks simple
let's flip over the box and look at the specs of the tablet
it has a 10 times 6.3 inches of active drawing area
our pen is battery free
let's unbox this little guy here
alright a standard warranty card here and some standard installation instruction manual
let's take the tablet out and you can see that
it has a nice plastic cover to protect it
i like this xp pen mouse mascot it gives you the look and feeling of
let's paint some great odds shall we
it has the nice black plastic material at the back with tiny little holes texture and at the front
there is another protective plastic
you need to remove it before you can use it but let's keep it first for now
we will remove the plastic later
so at the back of the tablet there are four anti-slip rubber at these four corners
so it stays firm on the table while you're drawing
let's see what else is inside this box
there is another pack of stuff inside
thank you card and thanks xp pen and a quick guide note
there's a leaflet here printed separately
that shows you how to use it with android
that tells you all the other stuff that you need to know about a tablet
usually there are 10 in most other tablet but this is different
it's pretty small and light and you don't lose it
keep it nicely
it is the same with my other deco series tablet
let's try to remove and see if it is easy to remove just clip it with the hole there and pull it
yeah nice and easy
here's all the items we have in the box
hold it till it shows the blue light
if it doesn't show any light that means you need to charge it and the charge
hold the on button
then there you go
blue light appears then
which is the deco mini
7w if you are using a mac machine choose the mac version of installer
and if you are using the pc windows choose the windows installer
let's proceed to run some tasks with design softwares like photoshop
so normally i will
it seems good and now i will just do some quick test sketch of a simple environment so far so good
i'm happy with the performance in photoshop
next i will proceed with the test in clip studio paint
i'm proceeding to test with microsoft word
let's test out the tilt function to see if it works like how it is advertised
i uses the ink brush to test it
when i tilt it down the brush icon will become longer and it detects the angle where i bent
it works great and we proceed with testing it on android
it can't function nicely
the small size graphic tablet works great with android devices
here comes the conclusion
this is the mini piece of graphic tablet with full features
it is affordable at the price of 59.9 dollar
it is light and portable
it has up to 8k of pressure sensitivity levels and with the quick response rate up to 220.
not only that it has a tilt function
can you believe that
and lastly the best feature of all wireless so is it a worthy product to purchase
thanks and until then i will see you next time bye
hi guys and welcome back to my channel today
I'm gonna give you guys my review of the Alba 7-inch tablet
if you haven't seen my unboxing video please check it out
I'll leave a link at the end of this video
so let's go through
what are my thoughts on this one
so guys my first thing about this tablet is that
do the setup setup on this one was the screen
I think that the screen it's I don't know the glass or the plastic on this one
it's it's it's quite weird
it has sort of a feeling of plastic rather than than glass and and it's really fingerprint magnet
Nokia 1 plus smartphone that I brought to this channel
it kind of has that same feel on the screen now before
I move any further
I usually do that but with this one
I'm not gonna do that because the cameras are really poor
the cameras are not good at all the front camera
you shouldn't be doing that the other thing on this screen
let me let me try and show you
it is quite scratchy
Android software on this one
if you're not trying to it edit videos on this one you will be fine with the normal YouTube
I've got a couple of educational
how apps for my daughter to learn and I've got Netflix YouTube
not many apps as you can see about five or five apps so
I'm not really putting too much on this one
because it will overcharge even if you put a microSD on it and try to expand the memory
yes you can do but to be honest the CPU and the GPU on this one
they're not great
they're not great at all and you know
I mean you can do it but you will start to see the slowdown of the device
what I do advise is that if you want to person videos photos you know movies on an SD card
I think that's a great option
that's probably what
I end up doing on this one and I think it is great to see that you get a micro SD card on it
but then again you can also put too much so I think you capped at 42 gigs
so for 80 gigs
I think it's great and I think this is a great
Buy if you need a tablet just for your kids or your small children and just for them to you
I think it is great now in terms of sound
I think that the speaker is really poor
it is a backfiring speaker right here at the bottom of the device
so it's kind of poor the sound
it's not great
I guess I'll show you a sample in a bit
it's not great and you
the screen is not great also but then again the price of fifty pounds
it does the job obviously
it's not great but it does the job the less okay storage
I will show you
so you can't go above that but you know nevertheless fifty pounds again
let's check the speakers so yeah as you can see
the speaker is not great and most of the times
if you're holding it like this you end up blocking it with your hand
so it's not great placement others speak
I think it is a great purchase
it's it's amazing where you get
I'm happy with the software
I think the software is good to have Android
go on
this one is really good although I don't recommend to use a micro SD card to install app
you get you get the option on this one and that's it
I mean I wish I could get more with this
I wish I could get a USBC 1080p display
so it's not to expect on this one for less than 50 pounds so guys
thank you guys
hello youtube today
we have a new device here
milagro laptop 7.18 pro
today we are unboxing this device
let's look at some specifications here
it runs on jelly bean 4.2.2 as per this milagro company says the specification looks quite good
let's took the real actual product how it works and how so we are unboxing here
the packaging looks like some cheap
uh here we go
i already unboxed it but just to show the youtube video here
the actual tab is on the on the right side
we have power switch here
finish with the milagro tag here and on the other side
it's completely simple
nothing's here let's turn on the tab
it is typical 4.2.2
lock screen unlock it
we have very fairly stock android
um storage capacity is usable 0.98 gb and nand flash is 13.64 gb
let's look at the sensors
the sensors in the elixir to application
okay uh it has couple of sensors here uh listed out accelerometer ambient feature
uh just take accelerometer
yes it's working
we have other friends
i tried a lot but other sensors
in the elixir app
i get the readings here
let's look at the other specification of the tab
nothing is here
it has some very bad viewing angles
you can see
i can't see anything from the side view
only i have another galaxy tab here
samsung galaxy tab
you can compare here
so it's a better and cheap option but i say the display quality is poor
now let's took uh let's play a game here
why city here it is vice city game
it's taking couple of minutes to load and the screenshot okay
we can skip that
so how is the sound quality sound quality actually
yeah it's the maximum sound here
we get we get okay sound but only with one speaker not two no dual speakers
okay we can skip that
the game runs fine
nothing no lag here
some days screen is responsive but color quality and the actual colors are pretty much poorer
i can almost play the game
okay fine we are back now
we go for quadrant standards benchmark
hmm okay we have the quadrant benchmarks here
the device scored at 2943
it's good actually
let's go back
let's tell the camera quality
the company says it has hd recorder but it doesn't actually run on hd
we have very laggy screen here
i'm just neither recording or not capturing the photos but see it's still lagging so much
let's take a photo here
so what is the resolution of picture taken because you just verify that
let's take a look
it's only 640 by 480
okay have a good time friends
sibel hi everybody and welcome back to the channel
today i have for you
a review of the zenpad z10 connected tablet
it's a gorgeous display
great sound and great for connectivity
because it'll work at home or on the go this is
we have a quick charge
3.0 break here for us bug of course from bra for masseuse
we have the instruction manuals as well as a sim removal tool and
we have a nine point seven inch 2k display
we have a back button a home button as well as a recent app
a five megapixel front-facing camera for video conferencing and the display is an IPS panel
up to hundred twenty eight gigabytes
the sim ejector tool out of the box
and be able to add that in there at the top we have left 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
we have a microphone and the antenna band all the way at the bottom
we have dual stereo speakers
and you'll notice that the color representation here are slightly different
you can go to blue light filter
I personally like to keep it as vivid
that's the color set levels that I like again as I mentioned
this is a hexa core processor
not an octa-core so we have four cores running at 1.8 gigahertz and two cores running at 1.4
SD card that I mentioned to you guys
I only get like barely two to three bars
you can use it to play games
I was definitely very happy to play
Need for Speed Most Wanted as you guys saw
it definitely handled the game pretty good
Need for Speed
Most Wanted is by far one of my favorite games on any mobile device
do all the things that you normally do now
we still have split screen and functionality
so let's say
I want to be able to basically split here so I'll hold here move it up
Netflix doesn't actually work
I was trying to watch a 4k video resolution the maximum
you're gonna be able to get this on
youtube is 1440
that's the maximum
we're gonna be able to get and of course if
are going to be here very very nice
I enjoyed this
let's do a quick video audio sample for you overall
the sound is pretty good
the one thing you want to be aware of obviously is the tablet itself
it's tuned to generate the sound on the right side
the sound will come more closer to you
now you do have a three and half millimeter
headphone jack to use with this
you don't you're not limited to using the speakers but the speakers are pretty good
let's do a quick video sample on the camera
obviously the tablets are not intended to be used for cameras
I'll go ahead and switch over to the front-facing camera
it'll start off with the video
so here's a quick sample of the front-facing camera on the ACS impact again
this is a five megapixel front facing sensor
you're doing video conferencing
this is definitely kind of work
well we went ahead and switched over to the eight megapixel sensor on the back of the device again
this is a quick sample using the back sensor just to see how it would look like
let's say if you were doing a chat and you were using it
I don't think people like us to take pictures
this is mostly for videoconferencing and enjoying content
as far as the skin that we're running here this is called
Zen UI and Zen UI is essentially a Seuss's skin over Android 7.0
I showed you guys in the beginning
this little basically splendid display app
and then you can expand that application management
Zen motion is really that was function
I guess II for email C for camera
I guess we have two different ones for camera
here we need
which will last you extremely long
this is again a nine point
seven inch display
I've tried looking into this
show a clock widget weather information and quick access applications
you can change those as well next thing
of course we have security account language
and about tablet
the notification shade is customizable
you can go in there and customize the notification stays set up whichever ones you'd like the
UI is pretty
snappy it's actually not bad overall for what you get
the zenpad z10 is definitely a media
you're gonna be able to enjoy most content on the say Netflix
I don't know if there's going to be an update to Android 8
that hasn't been a discussion about that
but you definitely have the full power of the LTE connection here
and you're pretty much stuck to your local media with this tablet
it's possibly with my son
this is actually pretty fast and it really taps into the full
LTE connection I'm gonna say thank you very much to Verizon for allowing me to check this out
it has a built in 78 million battery
I'm not sure if I mentioned that to you guys
so it's gotta last you for a long long time enough horsepower to power
thank you very much for the support
I'll see you guys in the next video
hi this is
Brad Linder with lilliputian and this is a Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet it's an 8 inch
we've got the Chrome web browser here the OneNote application and Microsoft Office as well so
it's a pretty versatile and pretty inexpensive
it has a starting price of just about $300
it's been a lot less powerful than more expensive chips
it's still less powerful
but it's much more powerful than it used to be
I think with full screen applications
so for instance when we're looking at desktop mode here
I've got all of the everything sort of scaled to 125 percent so the text isn't too small to read
so if you're listening to music for instance that will keep playing over here
there's a little door that covers an SD card slot and we've got a micro USB port
and then there's a headphone jack and that's about it
the microUSB port you'll notice here is the only port
you'll want to use the included
adapter if you want to charge relatively quickly
I found that it charges very slowly
you're not going to be able to charge it at the same time now
we just support bluetooth
it does support miracast wireless displays so you can hook up a keyboard
we're looking here at the weather application
show you the on-screen keyboard now when you're running sort of Windows 8 style applications
the keyboard pops up automatically when you're running in desktop mode
what you do have is support for a digital pen
it'll hover if you were going to web pages they have drop-down menus
you can do that if you wanted to
preview different applications
let's go ahead and try to write something now
it's nice to have the option
it's about a thirty dollar accessory
but it's not my favorite accessory
my favorite accessory is the $40 folio case
I'm just trying to get a better view here
there we go so you can see we can prop it up here we can prop it up here
I really like the folio case
$40 seems like a bit much for a case for a tablet that sells for $300
it gets closer to nine hours of battery life
what do they want to do here
let's take a look at whoops
that's actually not what
maybe and doing some thumb typing so powerful device inexpensive device decent battery life
it's a little bit slower
it's definitely also not the best device for everybody
you can find more details at Lilla feuding comm this is Brad Linder with little buting
hey there's all new merch over at crowdmade.com talk secure
hi i'm wazzy
you might remember me from such gaumont reviews as the m10k and the pd 1560.
that was uneventful
well the good people at galman decided i need to throw more things so now
i'm back with the pd
we should probably take a look at it
the first thing you notice about this tablet is that it's massive 21.5
inches massive can't picture it
well here's a cat for scale that's 18 inches by 10.5 inches of screen area for you to draw on
it's sturdy solid and towering
it's going to connect to your computer with both hdmi and usb
you will also need an ac power outlet
the unique thing about this tablet is the matte finish
it reduces the glare and has a less slick feeling making it more like paper than glass
i wish they were the actual press buttons and on the back or the side
but that's more a matter of preference for me
the 178 degree stand is way above the previous tablet
it gives the option to almost
lay it flat or have it stand up and act as a second screen
the stand itself is sturdy and easy to slide up and down and also since this tablet is huge
i didn't have to install the stand myself
can't override it now personally
i hate screen tablets
the last one gaomon sent me pretty much sat untouched
it didn't angle correctly it was too slick of a screen and i just didn't like it
but the pd 2200 changed that the matte finish feels more natural than any other screen tablet
i've used before and i can angle it to a position that's more fitting for me
there are pros and cons to any tablet but i think i finally found a screen tablet
i can comfortably make the transition to at the end of the day
that was probably a lot gentler than anticipated
it did get a few minor markings but it still works
what does that mean no idea
it's different for everybody
check it out in the links below a huge
thank you to galman for sending me this tablet out of the three
i've used this is definitely my favorite
hey everyone welcome to this review of the VK 15 drawing tablet
this is a review unit
that was sent to me so this are all the things included
we have the pen pouch and the pen
we'll take a look at this closer later
one artists glove nip remover and replacement tips
they included a lot of extra tips so many that
I don't even want to count them
this is the QuickStart guide or manual and on this card
the design is very nice and clean very straightforward
this is a single piece of drawing area
the active area is 10 by 6 inches which is a good size to use for any monitor size
this tablet is very thin
the indicator lights are just beside and there are 12 physical shortcut buttons
this is the pen included that supports up to slightly over 8,000 levels of pressure sensitivity
it feels very solid a bit plasticky and lightweight but solid to side buttons
here that you can customize to any keyboard shortcut c1 or mouse functions
this pan is not powered by battery
let me show you the driver before we go into the drawing test right now
it's going to appear in system preferences right at the bottom
this tablet is supported on
Mac OS and also Windows
the driver functionality is essentially the same just that we
so this is where you can customize the pressure sensitivity of the pen
let's go into you mapping
it actually looks like a trackpad
but you're not using a finger you're still using your pen tools to push the mouse around
and this is where you can choose the laugh and the mode
let's take a look at what you can configure for the commercial cuts
the cursor will slow down so this gives you more control
because there's no doubt the first app
let's try some curve
I see some issues here
so we're photoshop
I mean
just did all this and turn up the smoothing to 20% per helps so now
I have the smoothing to 20% and the curves they are smoother
now one thing
I notice is sometimes
the pressure transition can be a bit abrupt so for example here when
I am transitioning from this thick line to the thin line
it's not as smooth here as well
if you use this method to smooth the lines you may see some input lag by that
let me use the physical chaka button to change the size of the mouse
so the shortcut buttons they
are they work really well
let's see if there are any issues with pressure transition so right now as Sims
I don't really see any issues here
I can see that there is pressure
Adobe Illustrator on the Mac there is no pressure sensitivity by default
it's blanked out so to get pressure
this may seem a bit pixelated
all back to within this is mini back
paint pearl pressure works fine here very responsive so
I think it works pretty well
here has tried a strokes thinner thick transition
I think it works
it works
it works quite well here so no issues we have
MIDI back paint Pro
this is clip studio paint on the Mac pressure sensitivity
works really well
it's very responsive
then fake actually prefer to draw with this compared to using
alright let's jump to using
it's also quite smooth and now
I'm using Photoshop on Windows
so the quick strokes look fine
let's try to thin a thick transition again so once again
I see some abrupt changes in thickness so here
I can see that
so if there's going to be an issue in drawing well
I don't think so
I mean those issues
I think it still works fine for drawing purposes
I actually don't draw a lot with Photoshop
I use this mostly for graphic design
work for photo and video editing
this is clip studio
paint pressure
looks really well here and this app
it's quite responsive most of the desktop apps that
it works fantastic
I can get in a thick lines really easily and strokes they taper really well here pressure
sensitivity doesn't work by default on clip studio paint
Pro and affinity photo
they all work very well so
it doesn't work as well compared to other graphics software that
I have shown you in this video the price for this tablet
so that's all for this video review
I hope this is helpful
thanks for watching
see you in the next one bye

hey guys and welcome to another episode of quick expert reviews today
we've got
Ivanka as a matrix part which reminds me a lot about the Van
Keogh zette 1 matrix but I've reviewed last year and so let's have a look
what's in the box
let's start with the unboxing
obviously we've got the tablet and we've got the customer support leaflets
you've got which is always nice and then what let's have a look
what's else in the box itself
ok so we've got like a QuickStart guide which explains to us where everything is located
what every button does it's not like
there are overly many buttons that we wouldn't know
but yeah that's dud
then we've got the standard charging cable which I believe is a microUSB
yes it is just to kind of keep the costs low and speaking about costs
the device itself costs 70 power
then we've got a tray for a memory card and it also says SIM cards now
let's have a look if there is an actual SIM card slot in here
and no
nothing on the bottom because the speaker is on the back as I showed before so yeah
it's actually really nice
really the colors are really saturated not overly saturated and pretty decent
I'll play some videos later on the place of games just to show you how it looks
we've got a double tap on the power button to jump into the camera
nothing brilliant
we've got a digital wellbeing and parental controls
which is handled by obviously an Google Android works really well
YouTube for two hours
you can set it up over there
but if you'd like to can expand it with a memory card up to 128 gigs and so that's nice though
Android 9 device would then connected devices
we can pair it with
Bluetooth there is no NFC
not that you're gonna use
it's it's there if you ever want to use it both
the video recording capabilities for example are 720p at the front and on the back and the picture
quality is like 5 megapixels
so it's not brilliant but it's there if you need to make an odd Skype messenger video call then
obviously the device supports Netflix as well like I said it is a 720p display
and but it's an actually nice saturated display
when do you think about gaming like
movies fingered lasted around like 16 to 18 hours watching when
I did the video test
Android or better and then that and so yeah I would say it's a pretty decent device
thanks for watching another episode of quick expert reviews and
I'll speak to you soon guys bye
hey guys this is a sponsored video
i really wanted to try out a new company and this sounded so much fun
let's begin the tablet
i'll be reviewing today is called the m106k pro
it's a mouthful and it currently costs 63.99 on amazon
this tablet works with windows and mac operating systems including android 6.0
or above right off the bat
i love the way
this is packaged
it's really clean and simple
it's just really nice
and the inside is lined with this like black sponge type material so it keeps his table safe
there's still some weight to it
and they work great
it's really nice and soft
i think it's a great bag to use
i never actually knew they were called nib clips
but apparently that's what they call them
i don't know i i don't know i'm glad they included a pen nib sleeve
i've used drawing templates for years straight before and i've only had to replace the pen
nib like a few times and so eight just feels like plenty though
it's filled with some papers
i'll tell you how to set the tablet all that some
thank you cards
another thing in this bag is a drawing glove
i love drawing gloves so much
ever since i got my screen tablet i cannot stop using them
when i draw on a tablet they help me maneuver around the screen so much easier
i don't remember ever owning a battery-powered pen but i know they could be heavy
it's like you're using a real pen
really nice pen
last thing in the box is some otg adapters
i'd install that as well just in case it interferes with the tablet setup process
because i know sometimes people have issues
and you don't want any of that after plugging the tablet into my laptop
i was after plugging the tablet into my laptop
so don't be alarmed
if that happens to you
it's not a big deal since you need to download the driver anyway
but i just thought i'd mention it
after installing the driver it was really easy
everything worked out
finally we're on to drawing with the tablet so drawing on this tablet feels so nice
it's there but it's not the best it could be on the other hand
this tablet's pen pressure is insane
you know i can
i can feel it when i draw
it didn't work like at all
it just doesn't acknowledge that i'm using pen pressure at all on the client
i just used clip studio paint to test it instead and it worked fine
i thought i'd mention it though in case um but i it did not bother me
what i'm drawing with this tablet
they can be pretty loud though
i personally don't have an issue with it but i know some people might not like it
it just comes up to preference with person to person for those of you who watched my last video
whenever i was undoing a lot it turns out
it was just clip studio paint
which is what i kind of was suspecting but i wasn't a hundred percent
i'm glad i found this out now
this tablet doesn't do the whole
so thank you for not having that glitch
this tablet also works very well with fire alpaca
i really enjoyed drawing with this tablet
one of the main things i wanted to see in this tablet was a pen
thank you all so much for watching
i hope to do more of these types of videos in the future so have fun drawing bye you
good afternoon people of the internet
welcome back to Margaret baking and
welcome back to another food review
today we are sticking close to my roots
giving me both a sample bag and just one of their gift bags that they sell
so they cater to events they cater to weddings and things like that
Scottish gift shop prices is pretty
cheap and tablet is the sort of thing that's so wonderfully rich and sweet
you only ever really need kind of one piece at a time
this lovely kind of teal color or the ribbon really excited to taste it
so let's get into it now if you are unfamiliar with tablet which you probably are
you're outside of the UK it's the closest thing I've been compared to is like fudge
except where fudge is kind of soft and creamy and sometimes chewy tablet is kind of crumbly
it's cooked longer so it's got a kind of deeper richer flavor and a totally different texture
there aren't many people
I know from Scotland who don't like chocolate
it's a bit like I approve
it's just kind of a thing that you have to look if you live here so as you can see
it's this lovely kind of golden brown color and up close
I would be able to squish and this is me pressing quite hard on squish
that I'm gang
we're told look my finger said that's how excited
I am for this so I have never tasted sterling tablet before
let's see how it is
this is incredible
I'm gonna give you another close up just to show you how beautiful the texture of this tablet is
it's soft it's crumbly
it's not chewy
it doesn't stick to your teeth
it's got a gorgeous natural rich burnt sugar flavor
it's very sweet like
I said you probably wouldn't need any more than one or two pieces you know
I'm probably gonna eat five and piss off my dentist because it's so good
it makes me so proud to live in this country when it sees things like that honestly and again
I'm not saying this because it's been sent to me that
that is a booster
this is absolutely gorgeous
it's the texture you know
it's just as you guys might guest
that is like tablet
and it's really worth trying especially if you're a sugar freak like me
thank you guys as always for watching if you enjoyed the video
don't forget to hit that thumbs up button and subscribe so that you don't miss anything
welcome to moss review

keep that there
open the box and keep everything in the frame
okay so i like that has a little cushion
protect the monitor so here we have the design
it's got the name in the back
there's the front she'll keep this out
see what else we have
we have a user manual
so let's see english spanish dutch french italian and i don't know what language is
that's pretty much in the english version so we have a looks like a type
if the towel does not turn on when you get it
wait for one three minutes initial start to enter instruction for for language sentence
now you can enjoy your tablet with following actions using your fingers
okay so do not forget to activate your warranty okay
so we'll put that aside
let's turn it on
put down our here so you can see here
let's move this so it does take a while to uh start okay
let's flip this
um pretty much all these languages i need to make sure i should accidentally click it
that would not be fun
okay so i'm picking english and so then it asks you australia
canada india uk united states
so it has all these different languages or different places that speaks english or speak english
it's quite a few okay
uh let's see bring your data from a backup from an android phone and backup from
so i'll say don't copy okay
i'll do that later
currently i'm just showing everything that you do at the beginning
okay so after impend uh my email information so now
it's asked me to punch in a pen so i'm just going to confirm unlock with your face
i'll skip that for now
i'll skip that for now
anything else
another email account change font size
change wallpaper control info on lock screen
let's see uh manage
okay that's just the app
let's get out of that
let's try to figure out where the oh that's quite loud
let's try to find the volume
i think this is it
nope this is a little key up here
yeah it's okay up here so we're putting the volume all the way to zero
tell me it's screaming us right now
clear all and so
we're just trying to find the where we get all the information
here's all the apps that are included so we have a system calculator
there's a calculator
okay even though i turned off the volume is still obviously has to ring there
we go turn it off
we have calendar
see how that looks
okay chrome clock contacts dive duo files fm radio gmail
google keynotes maps photos play movies
play store settings
we have apps notifications so we have calendar
battery percentage in status bar last full charge nine days ago
okay display you can change the wallpaper brightness
here's the brightness level
i don't like too bright so i'll keep it bright for uh the video see
it doesn't really uh it's not okay
there it goes
there's kind of a lag to it
i think it was at 80 originally so it starts at 80 keep at 83 for now see eye comfort
you have your color and contrast here's wallpaper so you can change the worn to cool
let's go this way dark theme advanced
now yeah the dark theme be hard to see schedule power on off
you have your sound and so i turned off the alarm the notification and the media volume
so everything's turned off and i'm gonna reduce that that's a loud
yes turn a little bit lower not too fond of loud noises
okay so we have storage
we have the privacy permission manager show password lock screen
let's see uh location security accounts accessibility screen reader and stuff like that
there's all the information on that
uh let's see smart controls
they have to check tablet digital well-being and parental controls
google system about tablet okay
so that's pretty much everything that's included in the actual device
we'll do the video test the photo test um audio
so we'll test all those aspects of the tablet and then we'll do a review
okay so now we're just going to look at video and see the resolution how it place
i've pretty much played almost every day
and this is a really good game
you just never
you're always going to want to play more and more and more
and plus they're also coming off the expansion as well to mention that so
that's gonna you know help the replay value but even with the expansion
the base game is amazing
so i just want to say that so total i would say five out of five
this is our favorite car game
echoes a little and so but the resolution is perfect
um it has plenty of color
okay so now
we're just going to see and test if the game i downloaded works well
so that was extremely quick downloading
the federation is our peaceful home
on this day the empire came to bring chaos pain and death
they want to plunder everything in the galaxy to protect our home
we can only risk as you can tell
it plays very well games
let's get through all this
see the location greg
this is trying to get into the game play
so should we get out of this
now let's see
oh so we've tested
the video watched a video on youtube
tested the game lag touchscreen
i'm gonna do some video through the the camera
so this is a great tablet so far very impressed android
10 has great specs
so we'll see uh how the video looks and how the picture looks like it went through a little blur
it's very common in smartphones
and you know uh tablets which i would advise pen
i'm just thinking that because i you know
have a bachelor's in i.t
okay so now we're gonna do a review of the tablet and so one thing i really liked
is that the tablet offers where you could insert sd card
a lot of people said it didn't work
you can see that it's formatted
it's i got uh samsung sd card
i didn't have any issues
so that's one thing i really liked about the tablet um pretty much
um the manual i would say the manual
what position like simple things that should be
quality is excellent
very impressed with it
um one thing
i just wish that the i'll show here the sd slot
i wish it was a little bit
uh more thorough
so but you just clip it
uh it gets really loud
um there's a little bit of i guess rumble but that's pretty much in every tablet
because you know there's not
there's not much space for it
so it's not like a pc or a you know gimmick console so again sound for what it is 405 pretty much
i mean we had a samsung
that literally died
that's all the tabs we've ever bought
you know so i just you know these tablets
they don't they're not meant to last long probably two to like five years
you know
it's just an excellent tablet
it plays games
well no issues has android 10 and i downloaded and showed the video of the game
um you could see me uh you know using my fingers everything
the video quality of the camera
it's okay but uh tablets are not known for uh great video and then also picture is okay and again
it's tablets are not known for that
i would advise looking at this
descriptions are down below
and i'll see you next video
if you like this video please click like and subscribe
hi everyone today
i'll be reviewing the common m106k
pro drawing tablet
hope you enjoy
the tablet is packed in this white box
very simple design
it's actually large and has little pen
jacket and micro usb
we'll see the ant sleep paths on the upside down
the glow needs protect tablets
surface while drawing
did you know that i'm left-handed
the cable usd4 wireless connection pen is packed inside the left part of the box
let's begin to the pen spot
the pad has rubber bases rounded and it has a weight
and it's very pleasing to hold this in your hand also
it's petrol free and i think it's a big plus for those who wonder how to install driveway
you have to go to this link and scroll down to find the new tablet
don't forget to create all your own softwares and antivirus programs done pressure test
well the tablet goes 8 182 pressure levels and it feels good in comparison with my old tablet
i know we can actually pull the walking area upside down for left handers
i just got to use to draw like this
you can change the settings as you want of course
in addition to these buttons the table had 16 expressions on the top
which you touch with pen so here attaches the four keys
i selected eraser and the second key which means b and thus a selected a brush
pouching eight mirrors a drone also
one thing when you touch the surface with the pen a light will light up near the logo type
i want to say that the tablet isn't that expensive but it doesn't make it bad
it has large working area that is good to drown it as an artist
i recommend this to you
if you don't have many money goodbye see you soon
so were you looking for me or just really for my estate
i don't want it
oh so without my friends
oh i is
you had a date with sunrise
why am i not surprised
so why don't you go get dressed
take from western
maybe you can see the sunset
so why don't you go get just say cheap
i wasn't maybe you could see the sunset i stare into each other's eyes
it's never too early if the sun is up so pass me the bottle and forget the cup to find out of line
don't just waste my time
how about that four kings game and if the city never sleeps
you have a pretty face and i've been smoking on so many days around a pretty place
drink it drink it down
don't overthink it
we'll drink it drink
it down yes
we'll drink it
drink it drink
it down don't overthink it
just drink it down but if the city never sleeps you have a pretty face you
what's going on guys this
ETA prime back here again today
I'm gonna be taking a look at the all new on Android 9.0 tablet now
this is an 8-inch tablet offered by
it actually looks like a decent deal inside of the box
obviously you get the tablet
we have our volume rocker power button and a pinhole microphone on the top
we'll find a micro SD card slot so we can expand the storage plus a 3.5 millimeter audio jack
but we do have that 2 megapixel camera and the cutout for our speaker
this is a single speaker setup
it's gonna have the same CPU and GPU built in
they also share the same screen size
but if you ask me
I think the on tablet looks a bit better than the Amazon fire HD 8 screen
it's just a little more vibrant and it gets a bit brighter
we'll do a quick rundown on the specs here and then
I want to get into some testing
we have an 8 inch 1280 by 800
IPS display
it actually looks much better than I thought it would for a 64 dollar tablet
I was kind of impressed when I pulled it
there's three Walmart apps I think
Vudu and the Walmart ebooks app this thing also has 802 11 BG in an AC Wi-Fi
so you can pick up that five gigahertz network
Bluetooth 4.0 0.3
let's go ahead and get into some testing
it's actually pretty snappy and down here there is this little
Walmart icon if we click on this
we got those apps
Hulu and even if you want to use Kodi you could install a build from there
I've been using Pluto TV a lot lately and it works
great on this little tablet
I'm just gonna open up
I 264 as you can see here
ET 720 MP two GPU and for the operating system Android 9.0
Pi there was a couple updates when I first booted this up right now
this is the single core score
higher is better at the very top we have the on 8
Walmart tablet with a 574 at the bottom fire eight HD with a 585
they're on par with each other
the on tablet scored a 1741 in the fire eight HD 17 57 now
GPU intensive the on eight actually beat out the fire eight HD
I ran was 3d
mark ice storm the on scored a 38 12 the fire eight HD 38 42
now if we take a look at all these scores and compare them to newer
Android phones
these are very low on the charts and in my opinion both of these are low-end
Android devices I also went through my house and tested Wi-Fi speed
and you'll see that in just a second
I'm not a big mobile gamer so I just went to the Google Play
Store went to top charts and trending and found this pinata game and this tablets handling it
fine here's Minecraft Pocket Edition now
I'm gonna be testing from the Google Play Store in this video is san andreas surprisingly
it runs pretty good on here
emulations going to be hit or miss
on this device there are some n64 games
don't expect this device to run
PSP or Dreamcast very well it's a low-end device and it's really just not going to handle it
got another ps1 game here
Genesis 32 acts Game Boy Game Boy Color Game Boy
Advance is even going to work well on here but like I said Dreamcast PSP GameCube
those are kind of out of the question and finally
I'll just give Netflix a quick test here
I've also tested YouTube
Pluto TV and Kodi if you want to install a Kodi build
it's totally possible on a tablet like this and it works very well
Netflix loads right up
you can watch whatever you want on these things
I mean it's a decent tablet for the price
the biggest difference between the two tablets is this 64 dollar tablet runs
Android and the fire eight HD runs a modified version of Android called fire OS which personally
I don't like it at all so if I had to choose I would go with this tablet here
over the fire eight HD
they're very similarly priced
this is actually cheaper when the fire eight
so that's pretty much it for this video guys
I really appreciate you watching
it's actually a decent tablet for the 64 dollar price tag
see if they got one in stock
thanks for watching you
it's review time the HS 611 was provided for free by the good folks over at huion
I got the gray one so let's have a gander at the HS 611
shall we alright first up
this is what you get inside the box
the active area gives you plenty of room to draw though
your levels of brush
area has plus or minus degrees of
tilt you know
actually this is pretty much identical to the huion canvas
Pro 16 pen as you can see here except for the color bill for some reason
the Pens aren't interchangeable
they don't work on the opposite tablet
so this pain won't work on the campus pro and the canvas pro pen won't work on this
one is a bit strange
anywho we get this
Pro 16 depends quite difficult to knock over but the the hs6 11 well
you can see what just happened
the stand is not very good
I didn't need to install any drivers it which was neat
I recognized straight away but there is one glaring problem as you can see
there's no cursor so you can't see where drawing I don't know if it's the art programs
the driver suite looks like is pretty much identical to the canvas pro six teams one
CC once again
I'm just gonna draw stuff so here
we are doodling away and yet the pen
the pen is pretty decent
they've draws just as great to canvas
Pro 16 panels and since it's a graphics tablet
there's no need to worry about screen accuracy at all since you know
trying to control the pressure on this pen
we're still a it feels still feels a little bit more difficult but it's still fine
it's fine well the Express keys on the side and ice is responsive as you expect
I don't find that as useful the touch bar
it's it's far too sensitive and it's it's just inaccurate for me
I don't like them
I prefer like a tactile thing like the rotary dial found on the xB pen artist 15-6 Pro
that thing was really nice about touch if it just gets in the way as you might see
yeah not a fan of the touch stuff not really
I find it gets it more in the way than it's actually useful
the yeah the main novelty and selling point of this tablet is its portability
it is pretty small as you can see in the video there
so you couldn't say while you're drawing like the programs
Sarah is that a cursor there does it work better on that but like yeah
it's it's okay all right and here animate does what it does
best the crashes and corrupts everything so cool never change animate
it's not bad
the tablet feels quite solid
even though it's as light as a light thing it's incredibly light
the pen feels a little cheaper in the materials
but it's still fine still works the stand however or man that stand
I Oh I dislike that standard immensely
it's too lightweight to hold the pen properly and it feels really cheap but overall score wise
I'd say it's three point
seven five out of five
it's not bad tablet performance since this is just a graphics tablet
there are lot less things to go wrong like
I can't knock it that much
it works perfectly fine
the main selling feature of this is of course the ability to have it work on
Android phones and tablets
we've got plenty of Express keys the multimedia keys
alright if you're into that sort of thing but I still dislike the touch stuff
I'm not a fan of that
the bio is too sensitive in and accurate for my own pen performance
the pen worked well for the most part though
five out of five million customization is great for the size of the tablet
you get ten
there's nothing else I can really say about it
so yeah four out of five for that
so value of this tablet is pretty great
really if you think about it you get a lot for such a low price of $64.99 a time of recording
values a five out of five from me and tallying up the totals
then this gives the hs6 11 a total score of 8 out of 10
it's a fine little graphics tablet
I'd highly recommend it to novices or hobbyists
who don't want to jump into the screen tablet game just yet or can't afford to and yeah
that's another tablet review done and dusted
this could be the last one who knows goodbye goodbye
uh to which
i responded sure that sounds like fun
i will be posting an honest review on my youtube
though they agreed and here we are
hi guys anna here and welcome back to my channel today
we're doing a review of canvas 13 by huion
i'm very excited
this tablet is a very affordable
one it is only 239 dollars
if you do that would be a little bit extra
all right here is the moment
we've all been waiting for
it is finally the time to unbox this creative pen display and see what's inside
let's go cool cool here
we have the display tablet
right away feels sturdy so light i definitely can see myself taking it um to go somewhere
it is very small and light but we will look at it in more detail later on
what else do we have
we have the pen the pen
it's beautiful very thin
what else do we have
we have the stand
it is the pen display scent
we have the glove
you know how much i love these so i'm just gonna put it on right away
um that's where you download the driver
it's kind of funny
we have the quick start guide
that explains everything and how it's connected and where everything goes the wiping cloth
oh my god
it's actually a good size cloth
usually with my pen tablets
i receive like a small piece like this so i love this
so you have the power that's connects to your tablet
that's all you get in this box now
thanks so much guys it really means a lot to me
also leave a comment down below to let me know
which tablet are you using
and if you are using the canvas 13 let me know how you like it
alright guys
let's look at this tablet stand
i found this manual
it actually fell out when i was opening everything up
it says you can adjust it from 20 to 50 degrees to your personal preference
so i'm just gonna see guess
this is the tallest one that it goes
obviously so we've already seen this
let's actually see what it would look like with the pan on top as you can see
we can just put the pan here while we're working
i guess kind of just like go for it
go for it and put it down
you're good or you can use it as a usual pen holder
so everything's starting to come together
let's finally look at the tablet
let's unpack this
let's peel off this mask before application that is satisfaction right
it looks super cute definitely so light but i feel like it is very sturdy
um so light so pretty
i love the design
it's very simple
you have the buttons on one of your sides
you have the eight shortcut keys here
that are customizable
it's just very simple
is this usbc to usbc cable
so here's this cable
this one says connect to the power adapter and voila now
i'm just going to download the driver and i'll get back to you in a sec
so setting up all of the drivers was super easy
i was very impressed with that
the pressure sensitivity worked very well as well
there were some weird blobs
we can test as much as we'd like but to be honest with you
i don't really have a lot of those
my work is more messy in a way so for me
so i took a couple of hours to work on this sketch and just feel out the tablet
um i can tell you that i felt very at ease working with it
which is something you of course
so the most important ones and flip canvas as well overall
i just had a very nice experience with this tablet
i enjoyed it
it was quite intuitive right away
um i wasn't sure what to expect
so all you have to do is power it off and then unplug and plug back again
it didn't work at first but then i adjusted something in the pen settings
so you guys
you know
it's just you can't go wrong with that
it was truly a pleasure working with it
you know i was so surprised
i am used to this big tablet and the 24 inches so going back to 13
it really does mean the world to me all your support
it was super fun to review this tablet
What is the difference?
tilt, there is a scroll wheel, and it comes with a stand.
Compare the 15.6 Pro with the 16
Now I haven’t tested the 16, but to me the 15.6
Pro is a much better deal.
Pro is fantastic as is.
First thing in the box is the tablet itself.
Remove the plastic wrap and you will see a tab to remove the screen’s packaging cover.
Pull that off.
The stand is next, part number AC 41 if you need a replacement.
Hold it, name side facing up and push down with your thumbs hard to open it.
Then pull the flap open more until it locks in place.
It’s a budget plastic stand, so you only get the one drawing angle out of it.
Twist open the pen capsule to get the pen.
The bottom serves as a stand.
This is a magic pen, no batteries, no USB charging.
By the way, I do not recommend drawing on tablets from one brand with pens from a different brand.
I’ve scratched tablets this way.
Here is everything in the box.
The side of the tablet has the power button and a quick switch for brightness adjustment.
The screen itself has a finish
that gets rid of the slippery, glossy feel of glass.
There is no up or down side on that cable
so plug it in whichever way its facing.
If you don’t need the extension cord, you can plug the red end right into the power block.
Last, plug the other USB cord and the HDMI cords into your computer.
This tablet will not work unless both the USB and HDMI cords are plugged in.
If you have a MAC, use the white adaptor on the HDMI end.
If this happens turn the tablet on, even if you haven’t installed its drivers yet.
Then you will see your missing windows and be able to drag them back.
Uninstall any old tablet drivers.
If you have to uninstall something, restart your computer.
Go to xp-pen.com/download.
Download the correct driver - I’m using Windows.
Unzip, double click, install.
Restart your computer.
Turn the tablet on.
click the desktop and go to Display Settings.
Set scale and layout to 100%.
All that is left is to customize your tablet settings. Double click the desktop icon.
The first thing you want to do is click the Calibrate button.
A screen appears on your tablet.
Click the center of the red
X’s with your pen.
If you feel like it’s still off, do it again until satisfied.
To the side of that is Display
Express Keys is where you can program the shortcut buttons
and the scroll wheel.
Now when you press that button the scroll wheel switches to its next setting.
The other side of this window allows you to choose your pen
shortcut buttons and customize pen pressure.
Once finished, it’s a good idea to save your settings with Export Configuration.
You can load saved settings with Import Configuration.
You’re all set!
Now, for the review.
The tablet worked in every program
I have, a really good sign it’ll probably work in most free painting software too.
Since I’m so used to tablets that offer very little pen resistance, I was surprised
by how much resistance
there was between the pen and the screen due to the special coating on the screen.
I think most people will enjoy the resistance versus tablets that have smooth glass surfaces.
The tablet is somewhat insensitive.
But you adapt to it.
So I’d have to go back and tap again to get the button or whatever it was to go.
Once I got past that activation point the pressure sensitivity was great.
As you can see, no problems getting lots of line width variation.
You just have to press harder than you’d expect if you’re used to a different tablet.
Of course the lines aren’t perfect.
Same as with other reasonably-priced tablets, there is a little bit of funkiness
on the way the line comes to a tip on fast strokes.
The pen supports tilt.
Most artists never use tilt, so it’s not a big deal, but it is there.
The default setting for one of the pen buttons is to switch between pen and eraser.
In Photoshop this is great.
In SAI, when you switch to the eraser
you can’t switch back to the brush.
This is because the pen still thinks its in eraser mode.
Similar problem with Toon
Boom - if eraser mode is active, none of your tools work.
right, try clicking that button.
You might have been in eraser mode.
Once in the middle of my testing session the tablet decided
it was going to map itself to the other monitor.
Restarting the computer fixed the problem.
So you might open Photoshop and it disappears because it’s on the monitor that’s off.
You can turn the tablet on and drag things back, or just right click >> Display Settings >>
show only on X to get everything back.
Just remember to fix your display settings afterward or when your tablet is on you’ll get nothing.
That wraps up this review.
The XP-Pen Artist 15.6 is the best non-Wacom screen tablet
I have used so far.

but that being said
not quite the final at the time of making this video

I did find myself using the undo button
the image itself was nice and sharp but even after some adjusting

well done so a great big
what's going on everyone this is
Kevin here coming at you with my review of the tech last t30 Android tablet so
let's get started
so this is the tech last g30 now
let's take a look and see what all we get in the box
so here is the box that the tablet does come in
I'm sure as time goes on
prices will change so definitely
take a look at the link in the video description
this is the most up-to-date pricing and
I'm not really sure how useful it really is to have a SIM card in your tablet
Android tablets now
the display on here is 1080p
the brightness is turned up to the maximum level right here
and it's not the brightest display ever but it's certainly not dim
so if you're gonna be watching movies you can watch them in the native 1080p resolution
so that will look really good and overall this big nice
we are getting a 5 megapixel front facing camera on the left side here
it's really up to your personal preference
there's no right or wrong way to use it
SD card expansion
so you can put a micro
SD card in the tablet and dramatically expand
the storage capacity
now there is no wireless charging at this tablet
as you'd imagine there's also no fingerprint sensor or anything like that now
I personally set up a ping code
that's definitely an option
if you want security on your tablet or you can just go without a password or anything like that
it's really up to you now
the experience here gets the job done
it's not like there's really any extra
that's not a problem either
performance is very good as well
you can easily scroll through your feed you can also swipe over of course and begin
recording videos taking selfies doing different things like that
and that's not a problem either
so let's turn up the volume here
yeah so a pretty good speaker on here
pretty good
microphone as well
that's for sure now overall
they're big enough
now it's not necessarily the highest quality build ever
I mean definitely an iPad does feel a lot more solid but this is a less expensive option
have these pins here so you can easily connect to the keyboard then on the other side
there's nothing and then on the reverse side we have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
we have the microphone with a slot for the microSD card and SIM card
we have the USB C port for charging and data transfer
we have a reset button
I think you're gonna be very satisfied in general with how everything works videos
look super crisp and clear on here
so that's definitely very awesome and really for a tablet in this price range
I feel like this does over-deliver in both speaker quality and video quality
the tablet is also great for browsing the web
so thanks to that
I mean
so it's definitely a really solid media consumption device so who is this good for
this tablet is a good option also since it does feature the Helio P 70
most mobile games will work on here now
that will work call duty mobile
there's really nothing about the tech last t30 that
I don't like I like that
that smart phone would be costing about this price as well but I hope you enjoyed this video
I hope you found to be helpful
sup cuties your favorite chocolate drink
is here hope
you're having a wonderful day
today we have another special guest say hi to gyawan m12 20
yes but before we get to the tablet
give me a second to talk about my patreon
there you'll be able to get access to my animation process
sneak peeks and just other cool stuff link will be in description now
let's get back to the tablet
thanks gavin for sending me this tablet
i really have no idea if i'm saying this right
i want to make this quick and simple
so let's see what we get in the box
alright this is what you get
tablet case tablet wires pens adapters pancakes this case
i don't know what it's for with nibs inside a glove instructions
oh no guys
i think there are no stickers
let's talk about the tablet itself and i must admit i really like how it looks like
it's pretty cool and have these blue and purple marks all over it and i just love blue and purple
if you click these two buttons you can undo and review pretty cool
only this will be probably more convenient for a left-handed person
now that i think about it
i'm getting off topic
i decided to compare this tablet to how i usually draw my tablet and whoa i can make thinner lines
i guess
one of the benefits of connecting a tablet to a tablet is that you get better pressure sensitivity
well that's pretty much it now
let's head on over to my quotation marks computer from my last review
i learned that i should not use the old laptop
so i'm still in my mom's workspace
thanks mom and downloading drivers works really easy
that was pretty hard in my last review
everything was easy
here are the top buttons
here i can draw pretty comfortable
the pen works good
and you just get everything you would get from a simple drawing tablet now
i'll try to actually draw something and tell you my experience but to make things simpler
i am drawing
i don't remember if i mentioned in the video
but if you're drawing on an android device you can only draw vertically
i don't know how to explain but like i'm used to drawing right on the screen
um so yeah that is nice
i don't remember if everything was perfectly fine
i don't wanna sit here forever
so if you're looking for a drawing tablet i would i would recommend this
it's it's pretty good
you have like express keys only one thing keep in mind express keys
Jerez and german welcome to draw with Jazza
i'm Jazza and this video is a review of the in spray h9 50p from huion now
I know you guys mock the way I say H instead of H well
that's just how
I say it
Agera the way at the star the next is that this video is sponsored by Huey on
there is a 10% off coupon code
so if you want to have the tilt feature but also would prefer to buy off of
this is a review of having use this device for about four or five hours
so if you're looking for someone who has used it for years unfortunately
let's jump into the specs of this device
huion in spray
H hey th cut that you guys are gonna call me out on that so much
H 950 P tablet has a working area of eight point
that's a personal favorite of mine
it's a shortcut for undo because
I keep making mistakes as we'll get to in this review and new
it's doing that in so that's it for all of the basic specs and on the surface level
that sounds like a good but fairly standard sort of device the actual use of it
you open it up and inside
you have the tablet itself first underneath
you just go to the the
Heuer and website in particular
install that and it's pretty straight forward like that seemingly
I'll get to why I'm being mysterious a bit later
I say that because like I said I have used a lot of pad tablets in my lifetime
I'm bit of an elitist
I love my display tablets
I like drawing on the screen
it is for most digital artists
the preferable way to have a pen input
this is the first time where
I haven't needed to warm up to the use of a pad tablet
don't get me wrong
I can use a pad tablet where you look at the screen
I've used that a lot
this was the first time where that didn't need to happen
that's a different book altogether
has this really nice sort of Sheen to it
they say it'll take and the point
I'm trying to make is
it was really comfortable
it was immediately really comfortable which is great
one of which is the way you draw
sometimes people like to draw from the wrist
sometimes people like to draw from the elbow or the shoulder
this is sort of got one of those weird things where you're in one of either sweet spots
it's almost like you're supposed to do that
it makes a huge difference
it makes the art programs that support tilt feel like new and completely deeper art programs
because it's entirely built around that but really
I wanted to see how this thing worked in Photoshop
which is obviously what
I use every day and it felt way better and I don't know what it is like
it felt way more impressive the difference that made to use a lot of the default
the first is and will always be
you need to have a double click in your drivers
I don't know why it's not there yet
it should be a really easy addition just to a driver
update put a double click in there for the love of God
please the workaround I currently use with Hurom
so if you click and click
this is just a map
you know
it's it's not for me personally but
I do think it's there so it's not a con
it's it's a somewhere in the middle if you like it
it's great if you don't like it
I knew this would be a good device
I didn't expect this to be a device that actually blew me away
this thing felt great
a tablet for me
you should get this if you're a beginner and you want to get a tablet
this thing is fantastic and I as a professional
I'm actually going to be using it
that sounds weird but let me explain
I travel a lot so I take my laptop with me and usually on flights or in hotel rooms
it's fairly small but it's also quite heavy and you don't just bring the mobile studio pro
you bring the keyboard you bring the stand and of course you bring the charger
I have talked through this video about it
and that's me this is me
that's the weirdest thing
this was a real pleasant surprise for me whether you're a beginner
who is looking for their entry into digital art and animation
I haven't sort of experienced then something so small and affordable yet especially considering
this thing is only $79.99
I hope this video has been useful to you if you have any questions
leave them in the comments and hopefully
I'll be able to get to them and let you know my thoughts
go check out my videos
like this tablet that
I've reviewed today and a whole bunch more
that's it for now ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for watching and until next time
I'll see you later
I sell ebooks
brushes photo references video courses and more
there's another video you might enjoy from my channel over there
you can also check out my behind-the-scenes daily vlog channel daily
Jezza that's it for now and until next time I'll see you later
hey guys welcome to digit dot
in and a tablet is generally considered as a great content consumption device
you can watch a lot of great movies on the large display
you can play a bunch of games you can type some emails chat with your friends
this tablet is a 10 inch tablet runs on Android
it won't slip out of your hands easily at the bottom
you have a flap which houses the micro SD card slot and the SIM card slot
the overall build of the device is functional
the display has thick black borders all around
which isn't a good thing
the textured back adds to the grip which is a nice touch coming to the display the
PPI it isn't the Christmas display
we've seen but the color reproduction looks good
even though the display was reflective we watch some
Netflix on the tablet
too daredevil season 2 episode 3 stachyose fight sequence looked good on the display
the display looks fine browsing websites and reading
ebooks is alright
however sunlight visibility of the display does suffer
the display of the tablet has a maximum lumens of 390
and if you have used an Android device in the past you will feel right at home
there is a dialer app
which means that you can make calls from it
it feels slightly grainy
which will be a problem if you play games like subway surfer that require you to swipe a lot
the typing experience on the other hand is OK
typing in portrait mode is easy for me since
the device isn't a multitasking or gaming
Beast run too many heavy apps on it and you will see a slowdown
don't expect this to last you an entire day on the PC Mag battery benchmark test
the device lasted for a little over 5 hours
which is below average for a tablet
so there you have it guys
that was our review of this
Alcatel 310 tablet as always
we will catch you in another video
it's good bye for now
this is the a business centric tablet that
so taking a look at the side profile
this is still a very thin tablet here that we have from
our numbers got a lot of ports
it's got a mini
DisplayPort which is key
you've got a speaker
so this is where you can do
expanded storage in our internal storage
on the left hand side you do have a lock button
I like the profiles thin but it still gives you a performance now
the kickstand has a mechanism that pops it open and you can lift it up
the keyboard itself is one of the areas that it will
Nova will be pushed forward especially matching the same keyboard
you've got many varying degrees of viewing using the ThinkPad x1 tablet now the keyboard
let's talk about the keyboard for a second
this is a standard think that keyboard
I like is the fingerprint scanner
watch boom there you go
it is fast
it is seamless
whatever the case may be and also using the stylus that comes with it
it's very functional
this is a standard
think back stylus
I like what Lenovo is
no but the thing had x1 tablet I definitely recommend it
the pricing structure is great
don't forget to like and share this video favorite this video
do subscribe to the channel and always enjoy your entertainment
I thought today we could unbox it, see all the features, and then I can draw you guys something.
Well, it looks like I can give one away at the very end of the video.
[Milo] Hey! That one's for me! Buddy
no, this one's for the audience.
[Milo] Audience schmaudience.
Okay, let's just get into it
Yeah, so this is the Wacom Cintiq 16.
And it just came out, brand new in January.
But I feel like Wacom is the most recognizable brand.
And I have done a review for them before, on their Mobile Studio Pro, which retails for about...
two to three thousand dollars.
Which is kind of expensive, and a lot of people can't afford that.
This one is $650.
Which is significantly more affordable
and so
let's get into it.
Here we go.
A nice clean box.
Oh! This is the reveal.
Ready, guys? Oh.
A black box. What a reveal. Beautiful!
Look at that.
If companies can organize well, then I am a happy customer.
Here's the actual grand review.
Whoa! It's shiny.
This is the Wacom pen right here.
We have our basic power cables and wires.
We have the Cintiq itself.
And we have the pen.
And you can draw on top of it, and the image shows on the screen.
Also Wacom sent me a stand that comes with the Cintiq, but is sold separately.
So, we're gonna take a minute real quick to set that up.
Wow, I'm such a masculine man.
This is about the height that it goes at.
Right here.
Which goes all the way up, like that.
That would be my preferred height, I think.
Right there. Just a quick info for you guys.
Even though it's a Wacom Cintiq 16.
The screen size is fifteen point six inches.
Oh my gosh, I just pulled something.
Whoa, check that out!
What? I just found this out.
This little thing in here is for your pen.
You plug that in, and you put your pen, and it holds your pen.
That's super awesome.
Now it's connected.
Check this out.
Oh, I totally missed this, but the stand also comes with these two edge guards.
And this goes on the bottom of your Cintiq.
I look at old artwork. I look at the colors, and the brightness, and the vibrance.
This is a piece I just released.
Zoom in, see how it looks.
Looks pretty nice.
Look at that!
The colors look accurate.
The most important thing I look for with tablets is the response rate.
How smooth is the response rate?
And this one is pretty nice.
You guys can see that, right?
Watch. To be absolutely honest, no technology is ever perfect
Every product is gonna have some sort of a small lag with response rate.
If I can get close to the one-to-one ratio, then I'm a satisfied customer.
And this one, it looks really really good so far.
A lot of you guys know that
I'm religiously working on my book Nima this year.
You remember this thing right here?
Where you plug it in?
I just learned that there are extra nibs inside this thing.
What the heck, I didn't even know that.
Look at this.
See those nibs.
That's so freaking cool.
This is a one-stop shop.
This is like your changing nib station.
So you put it in, then you tilt it.
It's supposed to come o- woah!
Guys, you see that?
Look at that.
And we're gonna take one to replace.
And now your nib is replaced.
Ah, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I'm just gonna keep refining this real quick, and I'll check back soon.
Welcome back, and here's the progress of the piece of Sloan so far.
Oh, wait a minute.
What is a Ross Draws video without some color dodge!?
Milo, what time is it?
[Milo] It's color dodge time!
It's color dodge time!
Aw man, here we go.
Here we go, Sloan!
Give me an ice attack!
I hope you enjoyed the new character from my book, Nima.
You can see the final piece on my social, at RossDraws.
Working on the new Cintiq was a lot of fun.
The colors look great.
It looks accurate.
The response time was quick.
I worked on this in complete broad sunlight.
I've been having James stand right here as I film.
James, move real quick.
Look at all that sun.
Oh my gosh! Thanks, James. Go back. MVP.
Even in broad sunlight, I was able to work because it has an anti-glare film.
My only real complaint, is that the price of the stand is $80.
If you're on a budget that can be kind of pricey.
The upside is, the stand is a nice quality and makes for the best drawing experience.
I think it's a fantastic option and you can't go wrong.
And if you're thinking about getting a Cintiq 16, Wacom is giving all my fans a free stand!

this will be my first tablet review and this tablet was sent by
Baumann and I'll really thank them for sending me
this tablet is pretty amazing
I already own busted because I want to install the tablet driver thing
they're really really noisy
oh and also they lay eggs
congratulations babies they fighting again recently
government tablet
Samia and Mohandas is Kate or drawing tablet and I'm going to repeat this
o plus the inside is pretty messy
he didn't come this
Nestle my little brother just kind of dumped it somewhere and it cut all the floor sir
so it's really messy
sorry please sit okay
yes that's really nice
I really didn't see a table with this kind of button so I'm just thinking we can figure this out
Oh Oh Derek going to soon okay so we got a pen name that has four appendix
I know this stuff pen pen
these are really long
it looks pretty
it feels pretty nice
oh and also they should be a one tip clip
that helps the helps remove this
it's part when it's all cut off but my little brother lost in the progress so please
don't sue me come on so again now before
I can go back to my drawing
I noticed that this tablet is pretty light compared to my 4 years old Bamboo tablet
also this this is a working size of
I don't really count the inches
because in this contributors we use centimeters but is 10 and 6 point or inches
and it's pretty large and the price of this is less than $100
I think it was like $30 but it's really good
it's really good compared to the other tablets and their prices
it's really good
I think ok
so let's let's see how
I suffer for this nice okay
I need to check it out
the test works the brush strokes
oh it works beautifully it's beautiful
I haven't been using a tablet in four years and this is like the most beautiful thing ever see
look at my first
this is literally my first tablet review
I hope I didn't get this wrong or outside to shoot this again and I don't really hit the time
okay so okay
let's let's draw something
hello from teenagers
YouTube channel this is not Josie today
I want to do a review of this product
which i think is really worth your time
this is the vehic new graphic tablet
and it's not even like searchable on youtube yet
yeah okay yeah it is really good
it's better than I thought and it's definitely a great upgrade
react the last time
I tried is the small tablet
right here for 4x6 inch tablet which is still my favorite daily used graphic tablet
but this one is a bigger version
I see 230
something there's one is 250 but seriously you know what don't look at the numbers
they cut costs on things like packaging
and it looks definitely crappy inside but anyway who cares
CD is it this one
yeah the fake CD
okay so this one is not a CD
and that's the smallest that came of it
okay not sure if you can actually see that up close or you have bright enough okay
look this one the new version
okay right here
the whole thing is in matte black and it has a little tiny bit of like it's not exactly smooth
it feels a little bit of like textured plastic
yeah but it doesn't feel very plastic to me anymore like
this one feels more a little bit serious or okay like that and it one of those
that doesn't need battery but I don't know what this hole is for
at the back
they have a hole
it looked like those hewn ones where you need to plug it in and charge and this one
you definitely don't need to charge okay
so don't be afraid like oh there's a hole
let's sing a chord okay
it's battery free
what I like about it is that they come with a little pulse right here which is well at a glance
I like okay
so the tablet is so this is the react a 15
just you'd be like
hey it's just another tablet but no there's a big improvement here
okay now you can see because of the lighting okay
you can't see you nicely
this surface is wider and narrower than those of the more traditional looking tablet
and it's smooth
everything feels like one piece except right here
which is the buttons and the buttons
they did a much better job this time
and there's also a touch pad and this touch pad is not a trackpad
there's this row of button
we have a line in the center and then the top is completely smooth so even not looking
you can still feel that this is the bottom this is the top row and then this is the top
this is the bottom because the bottom like you can think the closer it is to the center
you'll feel the line okay
so that makes some sense to your brain okay
so you've got eight buttons
okay which is very good and overall the size and the slimness okay of this
the thickness is very slim very lightweight compared to all the tablets
I have so far now
okay now using this time
I don't even need my keyboard shortcuts at all okay
I don't even need the keyboard usually with the small tablet
one good thing is if you also have the small tablet right here this is the MEAC forgot a whatever
hey yeah this this is the thought
mix-up oh no s 640
you hit a small one
I wrapped it up a paper now
if you have this you can also use this pen with this one
you can also use your other pen with this one as well they can interchange so basically
it's the same pen
I hate USB cable and it got a 90 degree head right here which is very convenient
because this kind of tablet you always want that 90 degree thing and not just sticks out
let me tell you if you buy a walk on
there are some models that still don't have the 90 degree thing and so annoying at this one
you can do it this way or the other way
I really like is the driver
okay for this tablet
I got our that numbers killing me
so yeah it's the same driver you don't need to uninstall anything if you have the small tablet
okay you just need to
three tablet of the same brand together at once
only okay so yeah
I have like three V a crane and I cannot always uninstall install
you know just to test right okay so this is really good
I have three tablets in one machine and everything is done now using this touchpad first okay
it return back to normal to Center the 100% view
okay now if let's say
I grab a color
okay red something like this hey so I have my top button and the bottom button set up
the lowest two is always the undo and redo buttons
that won't change none at all
it's the things that I will add
okay like a brush
okay add color right like this
I think you can see it's very smooth
and the the the lines and stuff is very nice
very smooth the surface of this tablet
so but this one doesn't have that problem so they definitely kind of tweak
the driver a little bit better okay
the bottom left side
I click and it becomes the eraser
which is the opposite of 10 bottom right hand side button
it's a hand tool so
I can move around and I click this button for the brush again
okay so the sensitivity is very good and doesn't really require any tweaking and all alike to me
I'm totally fine with the stock settings
okay and then
always want to fill fill like this okay and then of course
the lowest two is undo and redo so
I find that it actually outperform my because the shortcuts
I will have an other video like really just drawing some art directly drawing
you're not talking but here I want to like just tell you okay
the overall experience after playing with this for a week or so
it's a tablet review so
I'm telling you that out of my personal experience
this is definitely worth your time taking a look at this and especially the size
it's very friendly for desk that it's not so big because it doesn't go so wide okay
this one's like why but it's not deep so it's great for this kind of setup where
I need some space
okay okay
so that's it for this
we really and hope you like it
check out the link below to get yours and if you want to ask me like
Oh out of so many tablet
how many star
or what's your rating about this thing
I will say so far
this is my second favorite one okay
the first favorite one it's a small one because I use it every day
okay it's so small that
I don't need to keyboard around that
just the thing is enough for my shortcuts
I really like that
also the new pen feels great in hand compared to the old one they design
okay really like that little little curve right there okay
so that's it for the day and hope you liked the review
check out the link below to get yours
we'll see you next time
is it good
is it affordable all those questions and more will be answered
let's get drawing
i get a lot of questions from you
guys asking about what tablets would be good to get and honestly
i haven't tried very many in my lifetime
i thought it would be a great opportunity to open myself up to other types of tablets that way
i can give better answers to those questions for you guys now first off
the tablet has a screen protector
that gives you all the information that you need to set up the tablet
the plugs needed to connect it to your computer some fancy hand pans
i mean look at this tiny little baby monitor
who's a cute widow's queen
you are the screen
it's a pretty good upgrade
fit into my workspace very nicely and installing the drivers needed was also very simple
all i did was go to the gaomon
wasn't that comfortable of a drawing position for me
i have seen people hold theirs while they draw
but that's just not something that i would do
luckily i have a stand that i already use for my ipad
that has a non-slip backing so i use that which you'll see a bit later on
i heard from other people that calibrating for this tablet is better out of the box
i didn't have to adjust it at all so i tested
i tried recalibrating it
but this didn't seem to really fix the issue
it came with a preset to change between the eraser and the pen and also a color picker
i think because i'm used to working a little larger
having a smaller screen felt a bit weird to me but i don't blame the tablet for this at all
this is a great upgrade or a starting point drawing on it felt pretty natural though
but there's an even better deal going on from the 7th until the 13th of september
it was easy to use and set up and higher quality professional grade
they do have bundles
removing and replacing nibs was kind of cool the little stand that they have for the pen
but that's it for this one
i hope you enjoyed this little extra video and like i said
i appreciate you all stopping by and i hope that we can draw together again soon
bye guys you wanna draw on the tablet
uh you get the itty bitty tablet
it's the end of the video
Hey guys, how's it going!
Today, we're doing a Tablet review.
And they gave me this..
Artist 12 tablet to give my honest review with.
I thought today we could open this, see all the features.
I also have an art piece prepared to paint with. And maybe I'll give one away at the end!
Without further ado, let's do it.
Hey guys, so this is what XP-Pen gave me.
An Artist 12 tablet.
It looks really nice, clean, modern and also the stand.
The stand that comes with it.
Let's see what it looks like, right out of the box.
Oooo, check it out!
Ooo you see my reflection?
Hi. So this is what it looks like
right out of the box, it feels pretty handy, you know, it feels like the correct size.
Let's see. What else is in here.
Oooh Check it out.
Look at all this stuff.
These are different power adapters depending on where you live.
Oh look, it comes with a glove! And there's also a warranty, hopefully 100 years.
Wow, look at that.
Whoa, it has a hexagon shape to it.
I think it's better for holding maybe.
I'm not sure.
We'll test it out later.
Ooooo, check how shiny it is!
Looks like it has some buttons here.
You know, kind of your standard touch strip that comes with most tablets these days.
So you see that shine right here, and look what it does.
Kind of diffuses it, so that's the anti-glare film.
I'm just gonna take it off.
So we have this stand as well and let's see how this works.
You guys ready?
Whoa! So there's this little knob right here where you can click and hold.
Oh! I'm using it backwards.
And let me put this on here.
Yeah, so the stand is about forty to fifty dollars.
You buy these together, you save a bit of money.
I think around 20 bucks, so, nice.
I'm gonna use my laptop to paint.
Lots of cables.
I feel like this is the Matrix.
I gotcha, okay!
I figured this out, guys.
Bear with me Power, to block, to USB, to another USB, to the red... to this!
As you get more familiar with setting it up, it becomes a lot more familiar and easy
XP-Pen We managed to power it up.
It looks pretty sweet.
That's so pretty.
Let's see what my art looks like.
Wow, I actually really like the color.
So this is the piece I have for us today.
I thought we'd try to finish it and refine it and polish it.
Of course, let's put on our glove that came with the tablet.
Wohh! Check it out!
A way that I love testing out
tablets is with the details.
So I have this painting here
I really like to go in
and kind of add the sharp features, add the details, and see how the tablet responds
So I'm gonna try that.
Look at this.
8192 levels of sensitivity.
That is insane!
Yeah, you can definitely feel that sensitivity. For sure. Ooo look at that eye guys!
It looks pretty good on screen.
I like it.
I'm adding a summer hat, you know, maybe she's at the beach and with her pet dragon.
I think that's kind of funny.
Maybe her pet dragon could have a little tongue.
This is before what I did, and this is after.
And you can tell that there's a lot more detail.
Before and and after.
That's the ultimate test that I love to do.
I like to go in there, you know, add some details and see how it responds.
I'll probably finish this on my own time.
But what is a Ross Draws video without some color dodge!? So let's do some color dodge!
Ooooo! Look at that!
Oh my god!
Sun-kissed at the beach with her pet dragon.
Milo, what do you think? Do you like it?
Hey guys, welcome back.
I hope you enjoyed watching me paint and playing with the features.
The XP-Pen Artist 12, I believe it retails for $250.
Probably one of the most affordable tablets on the market that can project a second monitor on.
Just to give a comparison.This
is the home tablet that I use and this is the Artist 12.
Make sure, you know, you don't try to show off because people are gonna steal it.
You know, I had to stop filming and try to figure everything out.
One of my highlights is the glove!
I absolutely loved this glove.
Oh my god.
It was like so smooth.
I barely even noticed it was there.
Just an FYI.
This is not a mobile computer.
This is strictly a tablet and a second monitor
Another really cool highlight
that caught me by surprise was how accurate the colors were.
And of course, there's a giveaway!
So I have two Artist 12 tablets.
I'm giving away one here on YouTube and Milo will give the other one on Instagram!
So you have two chances to win.
Rule number one, follow XP-Pen on Twitter.
Maybe it's an ice world with flying polar bears everywhere.
Of course if you want another chance to win head over to my Instagram.
Soon I'll make a giveaway post where you can learn all about how to win.
Any last words you wanna say?
Huh? Do you breathe fire?
Do you breathe fire?
I hope this review was helpful for you guys.
Aww Milo. Looking forward to the giveaway.
I'm super excited.
Good luck and remember, every day, is a color dodge day.
Ooo look at this!
Look at this glove.
Isn't that cool?
hi this is a review of the ug 2150
I've been scented by gearbest and all the links are in the description
I haven't bought anything from gearbest
they've just sent this to me
it took a long time to get to me but I think their prices are quite competitive compared to others
a display tablet is slightly different to your drawing tablet
it's a 21.5
inch screen hence 2150 1920 by 1080 it cost 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity
so all the normal stuff you'd expect and it's actually a nice vivid monitor
what's slightly better than Huey on you
get two pens and two charges the little dock that you put the pen on you can actually put up right
I don't like clogging up my C Drive but it's not really a big deal
it wasn't very big files
I did have to download the latest test driver for it to work on my machine
so the most up-to-date driver that's kind of in beta since
I've installed that it's worked very well
it's worked well in all programs
Krita Photoshop and blender and I'll show you some work from that in a second
the build quality seems quite good
the screen is very shiny
so there's a fair bit of glare
if you had a light right above you it would be very difficult to work with
the pen squeaks really slightly
which is not a big problem and the shiny screen some people find awkward to draw on
I don't really find it much of a problem
I'm used to the Wacom which is a nicer comfier screen
it's got a bit of roughness to it but it's not a great deal of difference
the big problem you're gonna find is the parallax so that's like the screen thickness in a way
that's not really a problem especially in the middle of the screen
it's very very similar to the huion
they seem so similar
you sort of wonder whether they're kind of built in the same factory or something
some people have talked about pen
I'm in Krita here and it seems absolutely fine and the pen sensitivity seems really nice
you can see me here during faint lines and then heavy lines and they come out really nice this
Salling critter the Wacom is supposed to boast something like 8000 levels of pressure sensitivity
I don't notice a massive difference
don't get me wrong the
you can see me doing a sketch here
very basic stuff pretty rubbish to be honest but you can see
so there's my review for the ug 2150 very impressed would I buy it yes I would
I think it's exceptionally good
great value
there's a 19-inch one as well for 280 pounds which is fantastic
I really like the big screen
that's one thing it really has over the
they are that little bit better
which does make a difference to your workflow
okay hope there helps and write in the comments
today the share popularity of tablet is decreasing
yes because of today's smartphones
the screen size is also getting bigger
which is around six inch so as to make the gap between the smartphone and tablet closer
it's also make some brands reduced or even in their tablet series protection
well this is the Xperia z4 tablet
which is the last tablet series from
the weight is quite liked for a 10-inch tablets which is only 393 crumbs
it is also very thin because the thickness is only six point one millimeter for this screen
the size is 10.1
the result is the screen display of the Xperia z4 tablet is very sharp
the color character is also quite vivid typical of Sony's flagship offer for screen quality
the result of the picture are still pretty good and sharp enough for the tablet class
yes a lot of noise is still very visible
the u.s. still use experienced
UI exactly the same as the Xperia smartphone
thanks to the large screen
that it's 10-inch yes from browsing
thanks to the large screen size
then it is also supported by front-facing stereo speaker
the score from the antutu benchmark is around 100 thousand
so if you want to gaming it's still quite reliable but for heavy gaming it seems less ok
I try playing party and the default setting are in low graphic and medium frame rates
but the good things
it's the game can run quite stable yes out of it is not smooth enough okay
we talked a little about this
SOC that was used namely Snapdragon 810 yes never like an egg then use it to be famous for
it's easy to hit an overhead chip set but in fact never can attend in the experience devoted
it isn't too bad we're in heavy
it is still quite durable considering the large screen with 2k resolution for my usage experience
this tablet can last a day with a screen on time run for until 5 hours from the charging time
it is still long enough to feel until full
its take run to till 3 hours
yes because of our activities from social media ill enjoying multimedia content
it is still able to run well
its performance is still quite responsive and smooth
yes out of
it is still not ok for heavy gaming okay
that's all if you have any questions just read in the comments
don't forget to subscribe so you don't miss the latest video from this channel
see you and thank you
I'm sorry for my bad english thank you
hello everyone today
i'm going to review the gaomon
m10k pro drawing tablet
it's accurate line
quality is good
it's consistent and predictable
it's really good all right
that's actually a review unit from gaomon
it's priced around you as 70
so this are the items included in the box
we have this usb cable
this is usb type
this is made with some thick felt like material
there is no pen stand
quality is pretty solid
it has a nice rubber grip here
and in this pouch there are some replacement nibs there are eight including the nip remover
it's quite similar to my 15.6 inch laptop
except it's not that thick of course it's much thinner
the active drawing area is ten by six and a quarter inches
and here at the side
you can see a little sleeve here
this is for holding the pen
so you can slide it in like this
the tapered ends
make it comfortable for you to rest
your wrist and there are 10 physical shortcut buttons on the side
there are five above the touch
sensitive scroll wheel here and in the middle of the screw wheel
there is a button a function switch and five at the bottom now
all these physical shortcut buttons
they can be customized to any keyboard shortcut and the button presses
they are very firm
they have very nice feedback to them
i've just connected my tablet to this laptop which is running mac os
this tablet can also work with windows
the driver for mac and windows
they are essentially similar except with the windows driver
it's not that straightforward
so you do have to read the instruction manual on the quick start guide or on the website
you are not able to plot points on the pressure curve
brush if you want to assign your own specific keyboard shortcut
just click on any of the buttons and enter your shortcuts here
you just have to press this button
i'm just using the default mapping
and if you are left handed you can change the orientation here to 180 degrees
you can't just turn it around and insert it one issue
i have with the mango s
driver is when i start my mac
this drawing app that i'm using this is midi bank paint pro
this is the line quality test now
this pen is very sensitive
it's very smooth
sensitive scroll wheel
um it's really good now with minibank paint pro
but now it's working fine again so i'm not sure what's wrong
that's the only issue i discovered during testing
so you can see it's very easy to draw lines with varying thickness and this pen
it's really sensitive
the drawing texture here it's a matte surface texture
it's quite smooth with the pen but still provides a good enough control
it's not like slippery as if you're drawing on glass
i want them to so the line quality the line behavior
the performance is very consistent and predictable
i have tested the tablet with photoshop
the performance is basically what you are looking at right now tube sensitivity works great
you can have tilt and pressure looking working together
this app that i'm using this is krita
the shape of the cursor will follow the direction of the pen
so i can have the cursor point upwards or be vertical like this or i can have the cursor
be like this where it's horizontal so that i can like this
so let me just connect this to my smash that hub android phone here on the left
i'm using the usbc adapter
no driver installation is required
so let me just draw this when i draw like this
you get this rectangle so if you turn the phone horizontally
in which case
it's going to be mapping vertical drawing area to a horizontal area
it's going to be disorienting
and now i have this samsung tablet connected to the gaomon tablet
now when i am drawing on the tablet this time i can see
it's mapping this horizontal working area to a vertical canvas
it's very disorienting
you can expect fantastic drawing performance drawing performance on android
um it's definitely unpredictable
the build quality of the tablet is relatively good compared to other brands
and the pen
it's very sensitive
it's very accurate overall drunk experience
it's pretty good by the way right now
anyway you can check out more reviews for the gaomon m10k pro on amazon
i have links for you in the video description below
I got my hands on the new 2019
this review is aimed at anyone planning to invest in a professional and high quality
pen tablet for photo and video editing retouching illustration digital art or graphic design
during which time I haven't had any issues whatsoever
Express keys while the larger sizes all have eight of them
the vacuum prepend 2 is a battery free stylus which is charged electromagnetically
it's very comfortable and a very nice design
I not sure whether that's the right term for it but that's just how I call it
I also love the extra nibs hidden inside the pen
I never really felt like they are getting in the way while
it is worth mentioning that
the hand-eye coordination takes some time to get used to
I'm working on
Control lives up to my expectations of it being the highest quality pen tablet
I ever tried
it requires if you are looking for a cheaper but similar option
what would you like us to cover next time on this series
we're looking at the medium size graphics tablet.
Now it has an active area in this central position here of 223 by 140 millimetres and
Now these new Intuos 4 tablets have increased sensitivity
you're getting 2048 levels of Pressure Sensitivity
now there are eight express keys down the side here
[and] These have tiny little OLED screens
Next to the next to the Express keys now they can be customized
We have a selection button and a rotation ring here
And you can create shortcuts on screens of various tools
if you're using photoshop for example
You can rotate round to different tools within the photoshop application.
So really really nice
Which goes in like so on your desk?
And if you open up this holder it actually contains all of the different
nibs that [you] can use with the tablet now
The interest for tablet senses which nib you are using in the tablet
[of] desktop real estate
Now this medium version.
I think is the best buy
Which tell you what the express keys are doing
This has been my review of the Wacom intuos For graphics tablet
thanks very much for listening
come back soon and check out more reviews on geek
hi everyone today
it supports topped with an integrated pen that fits into the display
so it's really accessible
the app the Army's in here is fresh paint and as you can see
the pen is working really well
and it's quite responsive once you get used to
it has two cameras
there's the 2 megapixel 1080p front face and webcam with a 5 megapixel
Full HD 1080p rear facing webcam
which i think is pretty standard there has HD audio of DTS sound
that sounds really great here
I'm using the power keyboard and it gets its name from its secondary battery
that's inside giving it a total of 14 hours bachelor and all together which is very impressive
this full-size backlit and spill resistant
which is great if you using it whilst traveling and can be a bit clumsy like me
and on the right it has a second
that's all for now and thank you for watching
for only $79
all the opinions you're about to hear are my own
I was expecting something all plastic and very cheap feeling with a lousy display
this has none of those issues
it's actually pretty well built
it's got a metal case on the back here
it feels rather solid and pretty nice in the hand
button here to load up your
Start menu or if you're in tablet mode to go back to the home screen there
this is running with an atom sherry trail x5v 8300 processor
it's got the full version of
Windows this is Windows
10 Home Edition built in fully licensed
and because this was bought from the Microsoft Store this is a signature PC
I did find though when I took it out of the boxes
the updates for it took forever so plan accordingly
you'll probably want to update everything before you install software on it on the side here
you do have a card
slot for a micro SD card
you just have your power switch and your volume rocker on the bottom
you have the speaker output speakers
okay not fantastic but good enough for the price point on the top here
you've got a micro
so you can plug in a standard
it didn't work on here
so this is it
so that's probably his biggest limitation
here is the fact that it doesn't have a second
the battery on here in light usage
I think you're going to get about seven hours
give or take if you start loading up a lot of games or doing some more intensive kind of activity
you'll see far less than that but for doing tablet kinds of things like email and web browsing
I think you'll get seven hours out of there without too many issues
there are two cameras on here
you've got a lousy camera on the front and a really lousy camera here on the back
the back camera is a 5 megapixel camera
it looks like there's a frost or something over the lens
I did clean it before I uploaded those pictures there for you to see so
the camera on here is not as strong a selling point but it does do well in other areas
I'll pull up the stats bernhard
so you can get a feel for any drop frames we might be experiencing but so far
the color on the display
looks very nice
I did a video on that a little while ago
you can see down below in the video description now
it comes in much slower and
I think it's again due to the fault of the Wi-Fi the Wi-Fi here is a 2.4
gigahertz Wireless n radio
it's not supporting AC
so you're not going to get any of the newer
we looked at just last week
lenovo mix 320 that one came in around 20
the margin of error here is about the same
I would expect it to and again
you can run the full version of Windows software so I've got an older version of Microsoft
Word here running on it
just fine is installed just like any other
Windows app would install
I've got a Bluetooth keyboard
trackpad attached this thing is from
Logitech I bought this about two or three years ago
it's great especially for computers that lack ports
I can get an all-in-one keyboard trackpad combo here
that can connect up via bluetooth that also works with a dongle
one thing to note on the accessories you might buy for this
most of them might cost the same
we're just about the same as the computer
does itself so this keyboard trackpad combo
I mentioned cost about $60 only $20 less than the entire computer will cost you here
this is running at about 15 to 20 frames per second
sometimes it does a little better
League can run on it so I've got rocket league running here on the tablet
we are running at 800 by 600 but it is running pretty decently with all the settings turned down
I was seeing frame rates anywhere from 30 to 40 frames per second so very very playable here
some of the newer indie titles of 2d games like shovel knight typically work
okay on here some do better than others
be book v3 ultra book
I looked at a couple of weeks ago
I did get to drop frames at the outset here but generally it has been performing as expected
so that's a good thing it doesn't do as well with the higher-end
and what's nice about this too
is that they give you a one-year warranty with it so you do have some protection there
I think with the Amazon tablets that are about this price
they only give you like 90 days
so that's a good thing to have here battery
life seems acceptable for the price point
I like the build quality
so if you're looking for a cheap tablet and understand what you're getting into here
I think you'll be fine
might you'll definitely need that
thanks for watching
this channel is brought to you by my patreon supporters including gold-level supporter
there are many pen tablets out there in the market.
there is wacom and other lesser known brands.
let's check this one out.
I want to thank Huion India for sending me this tablet for review.
now right when
I saw the box and its quality
it didn't feel anything which is less than a premium packaging.
the box was very well designed and built
and you might ask me
why is that important
the other side of the pen holder has a hole which can help you pull out the nib and put a new one.
whatever you get two
more on this in the video ahead
the pen feels very light.
it felt good in my hand and is battery frigging free.
this was truly the only remaining feature which
the pen is battery free
but the tablet of course is wired
I clearly don't leave a chance to ask for a subscription right
hey the pen supports the industry
standard of 8192 - pressure levels and 60 degrees tilt functionality
there are two buttons on the pen and the top click by default works as right
erasers top as erasers at all.
oh wow look at that
the pen holder holds the pen
570 grams feels light on this perfectly sized tablet the size also feels very portable -
or maybe even the larger size would be portable for you
I am not sure because I have never met the mountain personally and I hope I never do
the tablet felt really premium and has a great finish on its overall body
it really felt premium
they already have some keys mapped on them
the tablet is pretty slim and this is where the USB C port is.
Huion earlier used to give less at active area to work on so a super saiyan update right there
here is a comparison to how the tablet compared to my old at 16 pro
yes it has definitely fought many battles and won.
fun fact
I never knew that these soft keys were there on this older tablet - haha so lame
MuBotso lame. human
these keys won't need much force so it is bound to accidentally get tapped
I'm just kidding
how big of a boost and upgrade was coming from the h610 pro tablet which we used earlier
wow that was a really lame joke as I have said the response felt rock-solid
we had literally no complaints when we used it on
Photoshop even ZBrush felt really nice and smooth with great response
nothing else but don't get me wrong
there are still a good options from back home
but the kind of premium they asked for those tablets may it be a display tablet
a pen tablet is quite huge is quite massive for an average consumer like me
the light-handed pressure strokes came out
I had said that I will tell you what these things do
mm jack on every goddamn gadget they release
it was autodesk sketch and start sketching on the phone or a tablet
yeah it's definitely a restriction that you are only able to use the pen tablet in portrait mode
but it's better than having no feature at all and I don't think huion is charging anything
exuberant here from you for this feature
it is right there with this pen
tablet for free it is optional
use it or not
it's up to you but I'm pretty sure a lot of people would definitely love this
use it any way you want on your sofa on your bed in the swimming pool
definitely not the swimming pool
sorry about that.
on my note 9
I was able to see a pointer on the screen but on other non stylus phones
I would always see a pointer which I tried to sketch on the phone
some would definitely prefer the form and some latter but on the node nine
you're using you can edit
that's who you on did
I think it's going to be a very good deal
leave a like if you like my efforts on this video
leave a comment
if you have questions you can also reach out to who you on
Facebook pages and they are really helpful
they are very nice people
they will always support you no matter if you buy the product or not
that's what my personal experience has been so far with them.
that's all for today MuBot out.
this is a new model for 2017
it's like 95% the same as a last model
but they did manage to shave a little weight off of it
so this is the $79 version
OS 5 layout you
got your apps in the home screen
so this tablet
I have with the tablet is just is it's quite heavy
it's 13 ounces
it's like 20-25 percent heavier than like the iPad Mini and Samsung Galaxy Tab 8
so it's a bit heavy but the screen does look pretty good
I mean it's not quite as nice as like an iPad or Samsung screen but for 79 bucks
it's actually a pretty nice tablet
I mean the build quality feels solid
we've got the power button and the volume and the headphone jacks
right here
sports 256 gigabyte cards so has a quad-core 1.3
gigahertz processor it is pretty zippy
it's definitely a speed improvement
over these $49 fire tablet and it also has 1.5 gigabytes of RAM
so it's got more
RAM so yeah the speed
it is pretty smooth to operate
I don't have any problem with that as the fun rear cameras
I mean they're alright
I don't know why you'd really use them a lot
get rid of the reflections
we'll talk about the software a bit here so usual fire
OS layout got the apps
you can move stuff around
I like about the tablet
I mean it's one of the dimmest tablets I've ever seen quite frankly
that's probably how they get to twelve out of our battery life
it does seem seem pretty solid so the storage options
this is a 16 gigabyte model
so it's got about twelve point to four usable
it's kind of weird
at one point they had the option a while ago
it's really easy so this is actually the app
I'm using for screen recording right now and it works quite well
the audio gets kind of weird sometimes but
I'm recording that separately so yeah you can install the Google Play Store
it's really easy
takes like five minutes just installing a couple apps
I got a different tutorial
you can check the e-book reader blog or my youtube channel
you can find a video for that piece of cake and get Google Apps on here you also got of course
Amazon's app store so you got both about the best worlds and amazon
got all their stuff on here
you got their music apps you got their videos so if you have
so you don't even have to pay for that if you have
you can use tuning radio
they have a good selection apps
you can't really like move files with it or anything
it's kind of limited so of course you've got
Amazon's videos on here you got Prime videos
you can actually download them if you want to view them offline
so that's cool feature
you can obviously load in your own videos so use the video player with as well so
you can turn that off in the settings if you want and then you can use a different
Alexa the virtual assistant features
you can have different tasks done in here so
I'm not going to go into detail with that
so there just like a whole bunch of different things you can look that up on
Amazon this whole bunch of different Alexa skills
they have an onboard
help guide
so just you can do these different flashcard decks and set this up
this thing called word runner
it's like a different way to read
where only shows you one word at a time
I did a separate video for a long time ago you can look it up on YouTube
it's actually a really different way to read
I got a different video for that
more in-depth if you want to check that out but it is an interesting feature
it's obviously something that's not available on the
so there's ditional settings in here like you have to turn on text-to-speech up in here
it wasn't on by default
so there's those different themes a lot of people like the black background
you got some different font choices
because it's like 189
what do we talked about display
so there's this adaptive brightness
I kept fluctuating all the time
I really didn't like it had to turn that off
there's another cool like accessibility features in here
if you want to increase the font size you can increase like the size of everything so like all
your text is a lot bigger easier to read so some definitely definite
Vantage's for those with vision problems
there's also some other accessibility features in here so device options
you got a few different things in here like you can turn off a leg sight
we've also got like the lockscreen pin
you got encryption
you can like use this high contrast mode
there's like a voice screen reader thing that reads over the screens
and here's two kind of weird okay
I'm going to go ahead and wrap up this review right here
check out the e-book reader comm for some additional info
thank you guys and have a good day
hey what's going on guys
i'm ryan welcome back to the channel
welcome back to another video
hope you guys are doing absolutely fantastic today
in this video let's have a look at this teclast
p20 hd tablet 10 inch tablet full hd on a budget price
i'm gonna leave a link down below so you guys can check it out
i'll try to get a discount coupon for you as well so guys
let's start with a really quick unboxing and then i'll show you everything about this tablet
really quick okay
so here's the box t-pads tech list
that's my old t-class t-10 over there
there's not much to it
let's crack it open
oh yeah you can see a few specs here
capacity 6 thousand milliamps an hour
all right okay
so this is what we are presented with for a budget
tablet is not too bad
yeah let's put it to the side for now moving on
we have this box here with goodies
let's have a look what's inside
yeah basically just the charger here
you guys can see the specs
it's not the fastest charger in the world for
i've been testing it so far but it is what it is on the positive side
it comes with the usb type-c charging cable also included in the box
there's this theme removal tool remember
it's looking good
let me just remove this film and the one on the back too and there you have it guys
let's do a walk around the tablet so you here
you can see the screen protected from fracture
here's this brush
aluminium finish tecla's size is metal
i do believe them but it does feel a bit plastic
the rock button charging port
let me turn this around so you can see it better headphone jack there
you got the camera power button then volume rocker made of plastic
these buttons and here is the usb type-c charging port moving along at the bottom of the tablet
we have the stereo speakers
so you guys can see there on the side
got nothing and on the top alongside with the headphone jack
you have the sim card tray you can use
two sim cards or one sim card
plus a micro sd card 64 or 128 gigs
according to the manufacturer
there's the headphone jack
there and at the bottom we have the microphone there
yeah overall i think it does look good looks
it looks premium
i do like that detail
so let's turn it on
we are presented with the teclast logo powered by android in this case android 10.
and straight out of the box
this is how the tablet will look like not much things pre-installed
so basically you have the google apps and that's it no rubbish apps this is all you get
you can decide what to install later on looking at the settings here
let's check the about and as advertised
we can see it here
four gigs of ram
and there you go guys android version
10. storage wise from factory so 64 gigs version in the system using nine gigs
let's have a look at it really quick looking at the settings and on the display
here you have the night light
i'm not sure if you guys can see
i'm going to lower the brightness of the tablet
hopefully you guys can see it on camera so you have the night light
then it will dim the screen more of a yellow tint
not so cold white
we can see the eight cores
the arm cortex a55 running at 1.6 gigahertz and here
i'm not sure if you guys can tell on camera the quality of the screen or not
the 5 gigahertz band is supported battery
we have a temperature of 23 degrees for the battery
let's have a look what we can do
let's for example run netflix and first thing first
let's have a look at the max resolution
this one is not google certified
it doesn't have the google white vine level one
let's play some titles here
it's nice you can change the brightness directly there on netflix
hey guys the colors look look good they look alright vibrant the sound
another thing of this ui is if you exit netflix
like this you could
you can still watching that while you're doing some other stuff
i think this
that's the screen protector
the calls are vibrant
i like it
hopefully you guys can see it clear
we still have the screen protector there
i'm going to leave it for a while because i i'm going to use this tablet
hey guys i think it's pretty good as you guys can see not as good as my skills
yeah not too bad guys
let's play another one
let's try pubg mobile the graphics
we're playing with standard graphics
have a look smooth medium classic
i think it's pretty responsive
i mean for the price of this unit
this is how this double sounds like
it could have a bit more lows in my opinion but i think it does the job
okay guys so
this is the back camera recording 720p
max so it's not the best to be honest
it is what it is for those who want to know the benchmark scores there
you have it guys
single core score and multi score score
i keep finding nice stuff on this
i think this is quite nice and handy
another thing i find helpful
yeah guys overall
i think this is a nice tablet
especially for the price octa-core 4 gigs of ram 64
gigs of internal storage
one thing
i forgot to mention is built-in gps dual wi-fi band that five gigahertz band for me
it's a big plus
yeah i think it's a good unit
let me know if you wanna try anything else in particular down below in the comments
if you like this video if you enjoy it click the like button and guys
please don't forget to subscribe to the channel
thank you very much for your support
so I've been sent some more free stuff
let's check it out
this is the week a 50 graphics tablet
and it's the same size as the 830 so 10 by 6 nice big drawing area
I do like that size
I don't like anything smaller
funny like tricky
I do notice some people talk about having space on the desk
I think it's nice and thin
it seems well-built
it's got your buttons on the side
it's USB see
it's got a pen with a nice of case sort of material case and the pen is quite nice
it's a bit more whack on shape than the last one so it's possibly a touch more comfortable
maybe it's just what
I'm used to because of the wet on and it's got two buttons
it's not battery-powered so you don't have to plug it in or anything like that
it's very similar really to most in the price range
it specially looks slightly quicker response time
I didn't notice too much but it's been a little while since I've used the a 30
so maybe there's that bit faster
it did seem nice
it seemed comfortable
the big players seem to be huion you
GXP pen and wax on and now peak there as well
interestingly week apparently are set up by people from new
you're getting the same across the board in my opinion but this one at 40 pounds doing very well
so you'll be supporting me
if you click on them you can always go straight to the gearbest site and in the 8th if you wanted
its gesture control is fine
it works well
I don't really notice much difference between this and a wheel to be honest
you could do either
I suppose gestures a bit quicker the wheel actually
I find a little bit irritating and in different programs that will go faster or slower
it'll be a bit awkward especially in blender
I notice it really goes fast suddenly when I'm increasing my brush size or not
have you will aim left but with this
it's absolutely fine and you can just brush across no problems
you can see a bit of footage here of me drawing as an absolutely fine experience
it's really enjoyable
it wasn't a big problem just every time
I change the color and went out of the window and back in it
you're a funny line but to be honest
I seem to find those sort of problems with every driver even whack on
it seems to be one of those things where you're always going to get issues
the nice thing was that when you go onto their driver side which
I'll show you here
it's just one driver
the only problem for me is that
I didn't notice any squiggling lines
it was very responsive
maybe it is a touch more responsive than other ones pressure
sensitivity is all that you'd expect which is very good again
I don't notice much between them
the drivers work without any problems
the programmer the buttons were good
I would probably say this is my favorite now
well done with the graphics tablet
it's great and thank you for watching
so we finally have it
the best budget tablet is here
i play 20.
this particular tablet sells for only 121 us dollars which is about 105 euros
and what are we getting
we're actually getting quite a lot when you look at this particular model here
it has a fully laminated gorilla
glass covered full hd screen
the resolution is 1920x1200
it's ips of course
but what else do we have
we'll take a look at why i think this for the money that is is the best budget android 10 tablet
you can currently buy so it comes in this
not that most people mind
they're passing the savings on to us
we've got the usb cable which is usb to type c our charger which is 5 volts 2.1 amps and
it's very slow to charge this
there is a guide right here and floating about is a sim tray tool so the build of this
one is a plastic frame around the outside with this alloy on the rear of it
here you can see
so we've got a three megapixel camera here now
i am sure of it
i will be testing it out
though so power button and volume up and down now
these are made out of plastic and shaking it
there's no rattling or anything like this
so this alloy here has a matte finish to it
which is great considering the price
the octa core does actually have that support there which is great so up front here bezels
you can see left and right aren't bad top and bottom
yes they're about a thumbnail kind of width there
and what about the width of the tablet
you'll find two loudspeakers here
they're actually okay
the volume of them
they're not high quality loud speakers
right here we've got a 3.5 millimeter out headphone jack
with okay average kind of quality
it does of course support microphones so you can place voice calls with it now
we have a very good screen in this
i did not expect it to be number one
it is covered with gorilla glass
so there's no ugly gap between the touch digitizer and the glass it is optically bonded
it's 16 by 10 aspect ratio
the resolution is 1920 by 1200 and we have a very good maximum brightness
it doesn't work for the first quarter the slider until about here
you can see
it's starting to then change
so that's just one very minor little bug
i have encountered with my time using it so this screens touch is very good on the edges
touch response is great
there's a little tiny bit of leakage or dimmer pixels on the edges
but it's very hard to see this and i think it's not going to bother anyone really
it's only when you're looking at a constant white or bright image
you may notice a little bit but for the price i mean
this screen is really good
this tablet comes with android 10 and it has a may security patch level
now don't ever expect to see an update from audio cube
very little bloatware
it's just google apps you get with this one now
there is an app store here too and this performance is quite smooth
it's actually performing better than i expected
the four gigabytes of ram is helping recent app tabs
here too very smooth with this
i have noticed that
sometimes we'll get a little bit of slow down now
i've got nova launcher installed here
why because you can get rid of this ugly widget right here so down here
they've got the google search and you can't actually get rid of this
this is really silly to have this in there
i had the same problem with the launcher that they had with the audio cube neo x so performance
wise very good
and that's the apps to start with that we get minus mobile
legends there okay
i installed that when i took this screenshot here
so it's just the google bloat that we have on here
one search that means netflix is going to be in just standard definition amazon
prime video
in fact netflix
you cannot actually get it from the google play store at the time of this video
you need to get it just the apk file and then install it that way to get it
internal storage speeds quite slow
so this is one area that okay
they've had to save a bit of money
cutting the costs not particularly fast
does it bottleneck the system
it doesn't actually feel like it does really
i'm not seeing any slowdown from the storage
that that when you install things okay it might take a little bit longer
slow random writes there with this one
so that's one area
of course that is a bit of a weakness a little bit like the performance here so antutu
this is a low score
look at the weak area
you just need to lower settings and be prepared for the additional little stutter
here and there with the gpu's performance being quite low geekbench five score again
low low end tablet to be expected and the wireless performance isn't actually too bad
well away from my router
the battery life
time is very slow for this tablet
it's about like three hours almost to fully charge
so it's not particularly good gpu gps performance
i noticed that when i was looking at google maps it was quite a bit off
i knew where i was on the street but it kind of put me in the middle
where a house is so not amazing gps
you'll get the orders top and bottom here
this is one of my own videos
so it's running on the youtube sitting here at 1080p
60 frames per second and it is flawless
no starter no lag no problems
i'll just skip back here a little bit just to show you how it performs
have the sim cards in there
and we've got the phone dialer so you can place voice calls
i recommend using a headset for this
otherwise you have to use the microphone
that's here and then the loudspeakers in a basic speakerphone mode call
quality is okay
i've noticed that my signal reception and strength you'll see just at the top here 4g
my mobile phones are getting as well
so that is good now the quality out of the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
it is loud is it the highest quality
i've heard definitely not i would rate it as average but it's not actually too bad for the price
the same goes for the loudspeakers here
these loudspeakers actually have a good volume
they have a hint of bass and they don't sound too bad considering the price of this tablet
but here's a sample of them at 100 volume so this pdf reader here that i'm using with my test file
is google play books okay and this is quite fast
it's just the way the screen is coming through in person
you don't actually see this
it does look very good for pdf files now
the screen is looking pretty
any pixels
it's still playable
that is a lot lighter
a light engine for example like mobile legends perfectly
fine smooth nice and playable no problems there
so here's the front facing camera and the audio you're listening to
is that single mono mic on the front so for skype video calls
or maybe whatsapp calls and things like that and this is okay quality
your phone will have a much much better camera than these ones
i won't even bother showing you the rare three megapixel camera
it is terrible
often webcams are overlooked
and at least we do have one in this tablet so there we go
i think for the price that this really cannot be beaten
it's not perfect nor would you expect it to be for what it is selling for
so a cheap tablet but it really does offer so much a fully laminated actually decent ips
panel with good brightness
good gamma and good touch response
that is really unheard of normally for the budget tablets running android
10 dual sim support with lte band 2028 and it even has gps although well the gps is not very good
it's terrible really
your phone will have much better gps than this tablet
but we've got that option like the option of fm radio as well
i don't think it can be beaten
i think this so far has to be one of the best
now it does come with that con
the gpu is rather weak and the chipset
so it's not a super powerful tablet so if you do game a lot i'll say it again
it is playable
that's not a huge lemon
which often they are
it's a more premium model
it's the huawei mate pad pro
now you know everything that is to know about the iplay20 here
hey dream chasers
it's jc and a while ago
and we're gonna we're gonna try this out today
uh we're gonna open this up see what's inside and make some art with it so i'm excited
let's let's go
let's just get into it
the tablet came with this really swanky looking protective sleeve
the packaging is super super nice
i felt really fancy opening it up
thank you for choosing me humon
the tablet itself is really lightweight and thin
and it's double-sided
this is cool
i never had a tablet that was like colored before when i first opened it
that's because check this out ready ready
there's my sanic i'm very proud
um but you know what i think
i want to draw something else now
so boop it's gone those marks that were there they're gone it's it's just this is it's like magic
this is so cool
the stylist has a really nice feeling grip to it
and it comes with a little stand that opens up and extra nibs are stored inside
i had one of these from another brand
that opened up
i didn't know it opened up
uh and i actually bought replacement nibs not realizing they were stored inside
so that's actually very clever that they have little instructions right on there
i like it
it also comes with the usb cord and two little extra adapters
it also came with little wipes and a quick start guide
i was pretty impressed with all the packaging
this was really fun to unbox but my first concern was that pen
stand compared to my wacom pen
stand the base is really really small
and it's lightweight and made of plastic
i know
i shouldn't be knocking these around but like i have three cats
these styluses have been through worse
i promise you so
the humon driver was super easy to set up
i have the stylus buttons here set to right click and alt so that i can easily color pick
i think it would make a really good tablet for traveling with so with that in mind
i tried it out with my laptop
i used clip studio and i was able to start drawing right away
i didn't need to calibrate anything
it just worked cool beans
my first concern was that the canvas size would be a little small
it's about nine by five and a half inches and i'm used to working with the medium
wacom intuos pro which is about 13 by eight and a half inches but the canvas size was fine
i didn't have any issues with it and i really didn't miss those extra inches
you know what they say
it's not the size of the tablet
no i'm not gonna make that joke
let's stay professional
products and a lot of their pens have erasers on the top
because i'm so used to having that eraser on my stylus and yes i did
try to flip my stylus like 80 times before i remember that
that isn't like that
and then you have to put it down and grab a kneaded eraser
drawing on this tablet felt really natural
it has a nice texture to it
it feels kind of like drawing on paper because it has a little bit of a tooth like a texture
the pen pressure is good
another thing that i felt like is worth mentioning at no point while drawing this
i think it's a really solid tablet especially for 80 bucks
this is a good choice
it's an affiliate link and i will get some money if you use it
but i think it's really important to be upfront and transparent about all that stuff
so that's why i'm telling you also real quick
i just want to mention
i didn't have time to try this tablet out with my phone for this video but expect another one soon
that's also compatible with this tablet
make sure you're here for that by the way this piece is of my character nova
they're from my short comic far away which is available on gumroad
i really hope you enjoy the comic
it's deeply personal to me
but finding your way back
thank you so much for watching
i hope that this video was helpful

there's a button for that too
i guess but please let me know in the comments
let me know that too
all right
that's it for me but until next time chase your dreams peace
so finally another tablet review from me
I know a lot of you are saying
well what's going on with all those mobile reviews
where are the tablets where the laptops they're coming
so this is tech last new flagship
it's the t30 and what it has now is a much better chipset in here so we don't have any more
70 is in this and it's a lot faster especially in terms of GPU performance
so it's gonna be a lot bit of a games in my week now with this
it's definitely a lot smoother
it's also a much more efficient chip in terms of better life as you see later on
it's a pleasant surprise for this model and we've also got of course
the dual sim support from the previous model
it does support
GPS but no hardware compass four gigabytes of RAM 64 gigabytes of storage
the screen is 10.1 inches
protector that's outlining all the specs
so if you buy one of these new and you don't have the screen protector on it
start asking questions so the charger we get
they're so charged
time is a little slow
C cable in white
it's not particularly long this cable either
so we're going to five megapixel camera right up here
at the top the bezels are relatively large
you can see there about a thumbnail the width of them down the bottom
there is a pogo port
it's not actually out so unfortunately
I don't have it maybe later on
I can cover that
I still have the protector on here because I don't want to get
it scratched our camera on
the rear is autofocus eight megapixels
a very tiny poor sensor nothing amazing
this is our sim tray
it supports two nano
SIM door micro SD card type
shame we've got right here a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
now this does sound good to me the quality no complaints
there's no static
the loudness is good
but it's not the best audio quality
I've heard phones
do it a lot better
okay and then volume rocker right here
so this is made out of plastic
the feel of this button is okay
doesn't really feel cheap
it doesn't rattle anything like that
so that is good a little reset button here
if you pushed in for example a paper clip there you need to reset it and right here up the top
we've got two speakers up with firing
there will be a sample in this review
the power button
this is again plastic but the quality of it does seem okay
it's not bad now
the glass is 2.5
D and in hand it does feel good if I give it a bit of a flex
there's no creaking noises
it doesn't feel cheap
wait a little bit heavier
maybe than most at five hundred and forty six grams okay
so let's talk about the ROM performance
it has improved okay so multitasking
I noticed that it's definitely a step up from the hey leo X 20 series so the X 27 X 23 tablets
we're all a little bit choppy
this still isn't perfect okay
I wanted to demonstrate to you
the scrolling performance here in Chrome could definitely be better now
I can't just suddenly flick and have it
scroll down to the bottom
now whether that's the touch digitizer it probably actually is
that's causing this
the lowest brightness sitting
it's just a little too bright so it does strain my eyes there we go
there's an application called screen filter
install that and then you can dim it down to acceptable levels
maximum brightness will quickly show
you comes right up here to that
320 and overall that is good and the white balance out of the box cannot be calibrated
so there's no mirror vision application that we normally use to tweak
we're not seeing a warm white
we're not seeing a blue tint on the whites at least with my screen here
that actually seems to be pretty good
I'll quickly show you the gamma so gamma is off okay
that's what it's 50% brightness
ok jumping now onto the ROM
a game will take that
look at just how it's performing so what
I used to swipe up like that
we're still seeing some of that
there is an over-the-air update system but I wanted to make it clear
that definitely would take last
you will not see
Android 10 on this tablet ever
they will probably just push out the tick last
we're on there and this is the free storage you get
as well
on first years you're going to have 55 gigabytes approximately free and this is to point out
we have a depth of brightness
here you can adjust the font size and the display size
Widevine level cert 3
ok not good so that means
Netflix is and standard definition
you will not have full
HD ever probably on this tablet
I see this a lot with Chinese tech
they don't really care about that
and this is the internal storage so we're seeing relatively good speeds here this is
so you can see and to two scores 141,000 not bad
this is a step up over the old
hey Leo X 20
I don't know why it says real me v
Pro there it's because I restored a Google backup but trust me
this is this particular unit that I did run and - - on ok
strength is actually good dear and that brings me on then to our wireless you see
I have had a couple of dropped connections
I don't believe the range of this tablet
is that good
this was taken on the other side of the studio and it actually did okay here so it really depends
I think on the kind of router you have
GPS works well
accuracy of two meters now
this surprised me
mediatek doesn't have brilliant
GPS but it actually works
it is again
sorry so to skip that and all your on to better life
now this is the area where it is actually excelling this tablet
so you can see
I've got nine hours 37 minutes I'm still at 30% so this is really good
I've placed only eight minutes of phone
calls call
quality seems fine
last t30 is pretty good
battery life
surprised me okay
I'll give you a sample here
just a movie clip
it really depends on the audio source on how loud they're gonna be
I found with some games
these speakers are very loud with some audio not so much
but here's just a quick sample this
Terminator 2 get down
see that actually sounds all right
that sounds better than the tick last t20
this is a very large PDF
I'm looking at here
I'm using Google Play Books and it does look pretty good
the performance is a lot better
I've got one on here and then I can give you a quick sample of and I think it's fine now
so it's gonna be fine for e-books a gaming performance
and it's actually really quite playable a big step up
after a couple of hours of gaming you get a little bit of build up around here
I use my football probe and checked
it was up to 38 degrees
let's see if I can just get this guy right here
where did he go
I was that initially standing right
there is up against the shotgun and I managed to take him down
so you got a playable flame-red here it's not the fastest
I've got it on the highest frame rate sitting that it'll let me select and overall you can see
performance is good
so this is a sample from the front-facing camera as you can see
the quality is below average and not amazing the mic as well
what you're listening to is
we being recorded on the tablet as well now the rear cameras
I won't even bother with a sample
they are bad okay
it's not really a priority you can see
I've teclast to install amazing wonderful high quality cameras
no they are very cheap cameras on this tablet but do the job for Skype and basic video chat apps
and that is it
okay so just to recap
I'll start with the positives
we've got a very good gaming performance for the spec
it is okay it's not going to be a Snapdragon 855 plus no it's not going to be an iPad pro
no no but it is a huge step up from the previous models in terms of gaming performance used to see
Shadowgun with a lot of stutters a lot of lag
pubsey quite choppy
they give us and get kills in fact
they ended up winning that round of a battle
royale there which was good and something
then of course we've got voice calls text messages
dual sim support
GPS support FM radio
that's a lot of things here that has going for it for the 200 price tag
that build is decent
it's solid and then the battery life really really good
you will struggle to kill this battery in a day
no it'll last two days three days and you're gonna look at about screen-on times
that is really really good
so there's some improvements coming but the screen is a downgrade
Chrome as you saw when I tried to
it is really quite bothersome to just keep having to do this all the time
so the touch response then need some optimization
I feel the screen doesn't have white balance calibration for us me
revision app is missing no DRM level 1 cert
but you expect that so if you bought this to watch
Netflix and Full HD
not the tablet for it
so if you're in a budget this tablet does offer a lot
it's just still not perfect
ok you don't see major
firmware software updates like a jump from 9 to 10
that's not going to come through with these
the wireless is ok
so if you're using your neighbor's wireless or your routers on the other side of your house
where your phone gets only 1 bar or 2 bar signal strength
G better of course but 5g not so great there
so thank you so much for watching this tablet review
this is Lisa from mobile tech reviewer
look it's the black surface pro right
no this is the Lenovo ThinkPad x1 tablet third generation
and oh my god they get the award for most evolving design the first gen
ThinkPad x1 tablet
if you remember it was considerably smaller and considerably weirder
I'm one of those two when I use it for note-taking it's OK for art
not so much then
yeah it's it's kind of great
the kickstand now has two positions
so you're not so limited in your use
one of the other
gen is the thing now but finally no more the core a more core
Y low-power CPUs
we have the full court
you serious you can get the i5 or the i7 inside of here
so you've got a lot more horsepower
so that's a lot of stuff to change and it's for the better
we're going to talk about it now
it's it's really enjoyable
no extra spend pricing starts around 12 79 or so it's available with a core i5 8250
you are core i7 dish 8650 or your choice there
Ram 8 or 16 gigs
and that is soldered on board
take the back cover up to upgrade it
there's a bunch of little tiny
it has a quadruple a battery inside
I've seen some literature
that refers to this is rechargeable
not the one that we got no charging port
it's just a regular a Energizer battery that it comes with so anyway
two buttons on the pen no eraser on the end 4096 level of pressure sensitivity
this is latest wakame es generation with tilt support
though again you might have trouble
obviously this is a very thin
tablet 8.9 millimeters
you'd be talking to fine about just the tablet by itself
it's no place to put this in a silo
so what they give you
well this one
this is it doesn't have a USB a port
they made a special little slot just to put this little piece of plastic in that
is your little ink pen pink
well that it comes with some obviously you stick this in a bag I would worry about
it's very rubbery
I don't think that it's gonna break off
so it is very thin for a tablet of this size
it's gotten a little bit heavier since last generation
1.96 pounds you can see the metric stuff on screen just for the tablet alone
put them together
they weigh about 2.8 pounds
when you're talking about lenovo
ThinkPad x1 yoga territory
so hey it's a magnesium and aluminum casing and yes it does feel sorry
of course you know the competition their latitudes and the surface pro also feel pretty sturdy too
the glass is Gorilla
it does as well as you would expect anything with this particular
CPU we have the core i5 model again
it's a four core
the clock speeds is consistent across the top
it's really maintaining
that's pretty good stuff
performance is nice on this
there is a fan inside which would be normal for you series
CPU but I rarely heard it
which usually isn't the case with lenovo ultrabooks
so that was pretty impressive
the back will get warm
it's quite good
I still prefer Wacom AES latest generation a bit more than the entering
that's used on the surface products and HP spectre x360
line in terms of the pressure curves
just feeling really very nice and the palm rejection being a little bit better
it's certainly a good pen experience
so why buy this instead of the think they had x1 yoga
this is a way to get a three by two aspect ratio high quality display
nice but there's no
so surface pro is notoriously
sealed is glued together
this one is a lot more rigid in fact they've reinforced it
and it has two-stage backlighting and has a track point the erase turistic pointer on board
the only drawback is compared to larger thing pads the key travel is shorter 1.3 millimeters or
so so
the trackpad is pretty good
report surface pro has a pretty good track pad too but this one is a mylar surface
trackpad it behaves perfectly well the cover just like the surface by the way has magnetic
Pogo pin connectors the
it looks almost exactly the same in terms of the connector design there also
that keyboard is a little bit more durable instead of that
Alcantara stuff which you know can get a little bit nastier natty looking
Pro though is the fact
hello camera yeah not often
do you see that on tablets but service pros certainly has it
you do get a fingerprint scanner on the bezel though so reports
there's only Thunderbolt three which is not it's like I said one of them is used for charging
and it's versatile so there's no more modular design the modular accessories
they try it out with previous x1 tablets
that's gone because Thunderbolt 3
I had to whip out a USB C to USB a Donald just to plug in a mouse a flash drive
you get the idea you do have a headphone jack and there is a micro
SD card slot and a nano SIM card slot if you happen to get the optional
LTE module on the side
it's gone it's one of those old doors with a pokey hole you need a paperclip to open and close it
that's that's a pretty high bar there in terms of color saturation
you can see the we've got 99% of srgb we've got all the metrics that were here
brightness 396 nits
this is a crazy
bright display
good for people who are working outdoors
obviously it's got some glare
well the only drawback here is battery
life is just so-so it has a 42 watt hour battery
but you know that's an okay capacity
is that kind of average not too bad
hey my tests with brightness set to 150 nits and productivity and streaming video sort tests a few
it gets the award for most evolved to tablet in just three generations
you know usually when we review laptops each generation is just CPU improvement a little
change here
inch ultra bug
the performance is good on this
it's really runs quiet as well
I'm really impressed with how it keeps
the core speeds going on this is not much throttling going on
the display is lovely on this is certainly a good surface
Pro Challenger in that respect
where the displays are a little lackluster
this one has really good
metrics is keenly bright the keyboard
yeah that's the other selling point obviously it's a ThinkPad keyboard right with the track
yes but there
it is the drawback is just
Thunderbolt three ports it's great to have Thunderbolt rebut right out of the box
you're gonna need a USB a adapter for example
it's kind of annoying
I'm Lisa from mobile tech review
hi guys i'm vero and in today's video i'm going to talk about this pan
display tablet the Galman pd 1161
they sent it to me for free but as usual
i'm here to tell you my honest opinion about it
this video is also a giveaway
you can win
not this display tablet but you can win this tablet which is perfect for beginners
display tablet is incredibly affordable
this is among the most affordable ones
there don't have a lemonade screen
I just wanted to let you know this
let's display a tablet as eight shortcuts and I love shortcuts
I can't stress enough about how much I love them
control this tablet has overall a very narrow and elongated shape
which makes you look a little bit funny
so it's good for portability if you if you move around a lot
the tablet comes with a film over the screen
protector that you have to peel off
it was very satisfying to do it
when you remove it the screen becomes matte
which is what you want to avoid annoying reflection and glares on the glass
I must say to install the tablet
download the driver and install it from here
it's easy now
I would love to say that I love this driver but I don't just the fact that I have two units
tell all the other drivers from the other tablets from a computer to use this
it's annoying pass the calibration
it's quite useless because it doesn't really work
if you try to calibrate your pen things gets worst
so just don't ever calibrate it just an advice
I also have to say that
this tablet unfortunately didn't work on my eight years old computer
I had to borrow my sister computer and it works really well here after I set up all the shortcuts
the tablet and the pan
I was ready to start but first off
I have to say that
I don't even know how I managed to edit videos on there like it's a miracle all the time I'm just
I feel blessed every time I can export a video correctly
I need a new computer
I know anyway as you might know
that drawing on a computer with a display tablet now feels so so weird and different
before or it's just like it didn't know digital art anymore in general maybe
I got a little bit of performance anxiety
maybe by the way if you're wondering
it sort of feels like a meme like you know what is the tape mean
lazy artist five million mistakes liquify so yeah after a while
I didn't want to start any other
no other things so
I didn't put much effort into it anymore
I just tore it up and try to finish it as soon as possible
that's why the eyes look kind of weird
I do prefer to use an Apple pencil compared to a normal standard tablet pen for digital art
it's I just got used to it now so I do like it more now
any other thing feels a little bit weird but it doesn't mean that it's bad
you get much more versatility so it depends on what you do now
you're probably also wondering in which way this come on display tablet
it's different from the
Cintiq that I own
and here's the thing
it's not that different
I own a 13 HD Cintiq and I got the same problems I got with this one
the fact is that on a 900 euros device was almost a thousand
sometimes there shouldn't be such problems the fact that the driver is really bad and the screen
it's crazy and even if that
Talbot came with a stand
you don't need to spend more
this one is good enough
you will get the same exact results and the same experience
I get mad over the Cintiq
thank you so much for watching guys and see you next time by the way
do you like me posting digital art or you
don't care about it because yeah anyway
let me know what you're thinking about it see you next time by
it's got a 1.6 gigahertz octa-core processor three gigs of ram 32 gigs of on-board storage
so first we're going to go ahead and see what you get inside the box
then we'll go ahead and take a look at the tablet itself now
you can get this on amazon
we have the tablet
i'm going to put that off to the side for just a second here
we have a thank you card
we have our sim ejector tool
we have some manuals here here
so here is the tablet itself
it's got a nice protector on the screen here
so we'll just peel that off so right off the bat
the tablet does feel like it's premium because the body is made of all aluminum
uh which i always appreciate and it's got that a nice glass front it
it's got a good weight to it
it's not super heavy
feels sturdy on the side here we have our volume rocker and our power button on the bottom here
so let's go ahead and turn it on okay so now that everything's been set up
you don't have to really charge it up
you can just kind of take it out and use it right away now
it's very loud but even though it's loud it's very trebley
there's really not a lot of range to the sound
i haven't installed anything
it use 7.58 gigs of 32 gigabytes
like i said you can also use expandable storage if you need to put more storage in here
it's got your gps
it doesn't have any face
id or anything like that you need to use you
know like a pattern or a pin to unlock it
no lag here looks pretty good
go ahead and play a youtube video so this is in 1080p
you can play up to 1080p youtube videos netflix
anything like that and the quality looks really good again
i'm going to give you a little sample of what the sound sounds like
it's going to be pretty loud but it's it's pretty much all trouble
so here is google
i just googled
today's news scrolls pretty good
don't really see any lag here
seems to be working pretty good
everything on the screen is nice and clear and crisp
so let's go ahead and download some games and see what it can do in there
the brightness seems to be pretty good especially when you're inside again it's at 100 percent
i'll go ahead and put it down to 50 and we'll see what it looks like there so since as you can see
the brightness is at about 54 percent
if you're in a dark room you can turn it down
uh pretty much all the way and save a lot of battery life okay
so now we've got some games installed
okay so here
we are playing some asphalt graphics
look pretty good
i didn't notice any lag
so if you want to play asphalt definitely playable on this tablet
okay here we are inside pubg and i have the settings
uh graphic settings set as high as
it'll go right now so here we see
we can only use balanced
so we'll go ahead and hit okay
it doesn't look too bad
the game is definitely playable
uh you saw i killed a couple people again
the graphics are stuck at a certain level
mobile looking smooth so far graphics aren't too horrible
okay so here
we are in a little multiplayer match
this will go into our settings here
we'll see what the graphics are set at so graphics
you're going to be able to play call of duty
here's some video quality from the rear camera
one little annoyance that i did find out when i was trying to do some video
i found that my hand would obstruct the camera often another thing
i noticed for the camera
the rear camera is only capable of doing 720p and the front camera is only able to do 480.
then here is some audio and video quality from the front selfie camera
quality for the rear camera is actually pretty good
also isn't that bad either
which isn't that bad
it's just the settings that i had open as you can see
there is definitely a little bit of lag here now
it's definitely got a built quality
it's good material
it's a solid tablet
it doesn't feel like it's going to break so build
quality is definitely good battery life
it's got pretty good battery life as you saw
sound is definitely loud
it doesn't have a lot of range but it has a lot of volume picture
quality is okay
you definitely want a better quality camera but it'll get you by in a pinch picture
quality is also really good
i didn't see any issues especially when you're watching videos on youtube and netflix
but other than that
keep purchasing products to do reviews to you guys so
i hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did give me a thumbs up
thank you guys for watching
i hope you have a great day and i'll see in the next one later
hey everyone in today's video
I'm going to review the deco
pro drawing tablet this is a review unit that was sent to me from
XP pen in this video
I'm going to show you the things included in the box
what the driver can do
and of course the drawing performance
the link is in the video description below the content in the text review and in this video
it's exactly the same so these are the items that are included
yes this tablet actually supports
Android version 6 in addition to Mac OS and Windows
this is extremely solid
this is not powered by battery
so you do not need to charge it
it's not too light and it's not too heavy
it's just nice
if you want to have a pen stand you can unscrew the part where the pen is and use it as a pen
stand the bottom here and here this is
Robert it has a very good grip on the table
so this is the tablet
it comes in two sizes the one that I have here
this is the medium size with a drawing surface area of 11 by 9 inches
the smaller model it's 9 by 5 inches
so this is what
I will consider a medium to large size
this is u.s. 129 dollars at the time of this review
the smaller model is $40 cheaper at u.s. $89
if you are new to graphic tablets well
this is the sort of tablet where you have to connect to your computer
look at a screen while you are drawing on the tablet there is no screen on this tablet on the side
this is very interesting
XP pen cost is the virtual wheel
you can actually use this as a trackpad to control your mouse
and when you tap on it this will register
they will also light up
you can control the brightness as well the overall look of the tablet
it's really nice
I like the clean and simple design
it's very thin and you can see this part here
it actually slopes up to the Express key and this is metal
this part here is matte plastic
the buttons they have reef feedback on the back
nice very solid and now
let's take a look at what you can do with the driver
I am using my OS 10.14 Mojave and this particular version of Mac OS requires additional setup
once you click it
you are not going to be able to move the cursor on
Windows is a very straightforward installation
so here you can adjust the pressure sensitivity of the pen using the is a little dot here now
you can just a pressure curve
this is nice
I like this compared to those slider
the two side buttons can be configured to mouse clicks or specific keyboard shortcuts
this is not very useful
he just shows you the monitor you are using
you can use this tablet with dual screens as well
there is actually the functionality
for you to jump the cursor from one screen to the other
this is the mapping area
you should choose reset customer
this is quite convenient and now
let's test out the drawing performance
so let me start by testing the hatching lines the initial activation force
it's very light
so when you apply a very light pressure you can get very thin
lines and thick lines when you press down really hot
the transition from thin to thick it's really smooth by default and as the curve turns the corner
it's also very smooth
the pen is able to maintain consistent pressure which means when you look at a curve
we just the lines they come out just the way
I want them to so this is fantastic and now let's draw something now
the drawing performance of this tablet
it's actually quite good
they work really well except for
it works really well and this pen
it's really sensitive very responsive
this is very convenient for changing brush
sizes you can expect this level of performance with other perfect apps so
I'm not going to show you all the apps today
I'm just going to show you the ones that perform a bit differently overall
it's really quite satisfying to draw on this tablet
I didn't experience a lot of glitch except for Krita on Windows
the pen tip on the drawing surface it has a very nice texture to it
so it's not too slippery
it has just the right amount of friction and pressure sensitivity
well let's just say that this pen
it's really sensitive
this is one that I can recommend very easily
it works really well
this tablet is definitely good enough for line art and also for digital painting
let's check out the tooth sensitivity
this is on
the darker is on the left side
they give you different versions
K you may have to switch from wind tab to tablet PC or from tablet PC to win tap so right now
I have it on tablet PC and my pressure
it's located here at the bottom left
this tablet can also work with your Android smart 4 and right version six or newer
so let me test it out and see how well it performs
I'll need to use this USBC adapter to connect to my phone
this is a still me me max
3 with a really huge screen
so let me open up our flow
no driver installation is required
so that's pretty cool
this seems reasonably accurate
you need to lift up your pen to use your fingers to navigate now with this particular app
it's going to ask you if you want to use this
no issues here now
this app that
it's also very responsive there is no lag at all so that's great since no driver
installation is required for this tablet to work with
the line quality you can get
it's excellent lines
they can't choose that we are 1m2
and this tablet it has a lot of features it has 8000 levels of pressure sensitivity to sensitivity
I'm quite impressed by this
tablet the bit quality the design and of course the drawing performance
this is us $129
if you want to save some money you can go for the smaller model
US dollars cheaper at u.s. $89 and of course if you want to work with your Android phone
I'm happy to say that this works pretty well too
thanks for watching
see you in the next video bye
hello everyone welcome to my channel
my name is Jackson in this video
I'll be showing you guys
c'mon who asked me to do a product review but everything
I'm assuming also serves as a pen
holder table has a decent weight
just the right amount
I think to feel sturdy and durable but also light enough to be portable
the surface of the screen is smooth and matte and the rest are teleservice has a nice slightly
textured feel to it which i think is quite common across a lot of other tablet models
I think they work like Express keys
we have the stylus individually wrapped similar to tablet
I think it's supposed to help you do that
you need instructions on how to
you need to connect the tablet to the computer
this tablet uses a USB port
the pen has like over 300
hours of non-stop you so you don't need to worry about it
running out powerful quite a while after its first charge okay
so that's pretty much everything that's in the box
i've cleared up my desk out and i'm just gonna do a couple of quick size comparisons
I have my own PEM tablet
a medium interest art from Wacom which I purchased about two years ago the pen
I'm showing you on the left
the mobile studio is quite a lot thicker and heavier so now on to the review
I went ahead and download the drivers from the website which was remarkably easy to do
I'll be using the tablet to finish destroying of my OCE luma
I've drawn him on this channel before he's kind of like this sparkly space tear thing that
I've had for ages anyway
the tablet is on its default settings
I didn't mess around with it too much
what is plugged in and pretty much calibrates itself should a resolution of your screen one thing
I did notice what a tablet was that there was no mouse mode
this was a bit jarring because
I got used to it pretty quickly
okay so usually
I start by laying down some of the face colors of the character at this stage
D tablet was working pretty
well is pretty functional as you can see
the colors are going down quite nicely
I did like that as soon as I started using it
the speed felt really good like really natural
I liked the surface up a tablet
it has a bit of friction a bit of drag which gives it the natural
I did find that when I first started using it with Medibank
there were a few lag issues but those into eventually sort themselves out the more
I got into the painting
it seems to be the case with most tablets
I'm gonna kick this drawing into time-lapse now I'll be back once
I finished a bit more all right
we made some progress
I just put in some shadows and colors and I merge all the layers and now we're onto the painting
I'm actually quite liking
how this is turning out actually
I really didn't know where it would be going had to start
it never really worked out before but today
apparently it is so we'll keep going at it at one point
if that happens usually the best thing to do is to restart everything
I did forget to mention you
I'm using the keyboard I didn't end up using any of these Express keys throughout the drawing
and it's like there's so many of them like honestly
the drying process was very very smooth
I think I'll get this tablet
a solid b-plus
it has all the things that tablet needs to have
it will do the job perfectly fine
and it's perfectly functional
I know for low artists who are students or young and have no money
think this is a pretty good budget choice to go with
there's a link down below in the description to my blog
I really wasn't expecting it since I'm still such a tiny youtube channel channel
this offer was indeed very validating haha
anyway thank you guys for watching and as always
I hope this video was helpful and I'll catch you all soon so bye
this is the
Veeck VK 1560 it's brand-new pen display
I've not heard of this brand before so today we're gonna be testing it out
this product was provided to be by
Veeck or maybe it's pronounced VK
so what is this thing
it's a pen display basically
it's an extra monitor that you can plug into your Mac or Windows computer
you can draw directly on the screen using the included pen
there have been a whole bunch of these 15.6 inch display tablets
pop up over the last year
it's a really nice size to draw
it's not too big
it's not too small it's like the
our adjustment buttons along the back of the device
what on earth does that mean
that means that there is some space between where the screen is and the glass above it
that's currently not doing that is Wacom Cintiq Pro as of now
we haven't seen that kind of screen trickle down into these budget displays yet but
I wouldn't be surprised if we see that
start to happen in the next year or so as we have seen with some of these smaller
Huli on products
the screen itself has a film on it
it's like an anti-glare film the screen isn't super glossy but you get some reflection on it
not overall it feels pretty good to drawn the film gives you some pen resistance not a ton
if you really wanted to
you could take it off
it has a standard release
latch on it
lets you set it at any angle
I've never seen that before
works pretty well
I never do that
it's really nice to have a dedicated place to put it
so tell me more about this pen you keep talking
it's pretty comfortable to hold
it is pretty light
the whole thing is made of a soft rubber flares out at the tops
it's very comfortable in the hand
there are also two buttons along the sides
I'm drawing they are customizable though so you can set them to whatever you want
the pen is also battery free
so you're never gonna be swapping batteries in and out or plugging it in to charge it
the pressure of the pen itself feels pretty good
it holds pressure
well fast hats lines do well
I'm not getting any fish
hooks on those lines
this is where we get to my favorite boogeyman
I'm talking about line quality and that's where I see some problems here
like how do you define what is acceptable
and and what's not like what is like a tablet color and here
I'd put this device somewhere in the middle
Photoshop at about five percent is definitely cleaner when I bump it up to about ten percent
I feel like that's a good range that that's a quality line that I'm getting there
so today's question
why not
just use a stroke straightener all the time
if that's the kind of line you're looking for that's a great question
I often do even appropriate
I straighten my lines a little bit so I can make them as smooth as possible
there is a downside to doing this
the line tends to lag behind the pen tip
when you draw with a stroke
straightener turned on the higher
you set the stroke straightener
it's not uncommon to accidentally stop short same with fast hatched lines when
I do have to draw quickly or faster lines
I'll often just toggle the stroke straightener off so I can get the lines
I'm looking for so in a nutshell the higher I turn up that stroke straightener the less accuracy
I have when I'm drawing so even though this pen did have some jitter to it
so speaking about the pros and the cons of this device overall
I thought it was a good screen
it had good color
those are some of the better things about it
I think some people are really gonna like the little divot that depends sits in as far as cons
I look at all of the other devices out
there that are in this category
I think I've reviewed five of them now
and of course as always i
i've ranked these on my website
i think there are just other devices
that just have a better pen to them
that's a little bit more expensive
that doesn't have that problem
begin with this is the first display or any kind of product
they've done a pretty good job with this and I hope they continued to make more and more devices
hey guys so in today's video
I have a tablet review for you
it's going to be super interesting and fun and I'm excited so the tablet
I'm just going to tell you my honest opinion
I think of it so first
I'm just going to unbox it and show you what comes inside the box the first one you open the box
the tablet comes in this plastic sleeve for protection is a very thick material
well if you know me you know
the size of it is kind of like a safe
but it's not too big or too small
I do like the size of it and it is pretty portable
the plastic is this lightweight kind of plastic
but it's not cheap
it is just a very light tablet and so
I kind of like that about it
so the pen pressure is 8,192 levels of pressure
the pressure has to be used great
the way the tablet feels the pen has a really good bounce to it
I know that sounds strange
but there's some tablets that are very stiff
there is a downside
and that is that the lines don't come up smoothly and so
not because of the tablet though because of my computer so
I just recorded the screen with a camera
I'm sorry that it's striated and it might hurt your eyes for a second
just bear with me as you can see
I don't know you can just you can see what I'm talking about
it's not completely smooth
and that is kind of an issue if you're wanting to buy a professional tablet now
I understand it could be my computer or the driver and I'm sure it has something to do
so you know
I'm not 100% sure about that so one thing I've noticed is when I'm working at a smaller resolution
it doesn't really have this effect the lines come out smoothly but when
I'm working a higher resolution which I usually do
I posted this video
if there's still that reoccurring problem okay
yeah that's a pretty big downside to me
it didn't have that same problem
so if you're a big or an amateur and you use pretty small file sizes for your paintings
I would recommend this tablet since it is sturdy
the lines move
this thing is a pretty big problem but it might not affect to you
it didn't really work so it could be a driver problem or it could be the fact that
I think this tablet would be pretty good for you
it is a pretty affordable price $90
the size is nice
it feels very well on the pressure
sensitivity is amazing so I would recommend it for those features
everything is perfect about it except for that smoothness feature
I hope it was okay
if you like this video please leave me a thumbs up so
just you know two extra videos that speak cool beans
okay text you later bye
what's so great about
Caesar Brutus is just as cute a Caesar can't Brutus
it's just a smartest
Caesar people totally like Brutus
just as much as they like
Caesar and what did it become
okay for one person to be the boss of everybody huh
because that's not what role was about but you totally just stab
Caesar hi my name is Chris Thalia or crystal and today
I'm reviewing the Delmont PD
2200 tablet damaged out to me recently and a story together and of course
I was like yes yes I will
you got a connect personal computer
the box comes with the display
a pen it stands nibs a glove and the cables
I'm like oh my god I broke it what do I do
that was us but after the 10 minutes everything worked out so smart
okay going to help a tablet works
this tablet is pretty big
it also has an adjustable stand so you don't have to put out your neck when drawing
I used to stack binders and notebooks to get an incline
it doesn't become completely flat
the stand is thick and sturdy
so you're able to put some body weight onto it
you can adjust the stand between 15 and 85 degrees and here you can also locate the reports
I mentioned earlier for how the tablet works
I'm comparing it to the other tablets
I've used which are a few
I've used the welcome in to us
Mohini on screen and the surface pro steps compared to all the springs
I've used this one holds up really well like I said this ice is great and the screen is awesome PT
I know when I had to change the batteries from one of my other pens or is an inconvenience
it makes me feel secure
the pen sensitivity also came on right away and I didn't have to spend time messing with it
so that saved me like two hours
so it's laminated screen is thinner and allows a more accurate pen stroke
I didn't notice a lag or anything
my line stucked
open my cursor but
it makes it really easy to sign documents if you need to but since I predominantly use it for art
I'm glad my main programs are supported in the speedpaint
they have a picture showing some of the bigger brands to support so
after going through the process of adjusting the colors it came out much more accurately
the process of adjusting was explaining the meaning emails
I'm grateful for that
they're really efficient on the site
we have an eraser and a zoomin and zoom-out picture and on the other side by the end
they have a frequently asked questions that came in handy for me when the second time
okay so coming to price
the tablet is four hundred and forty dollars so everyone is broke get out
but it's just second how to talk to your belt if you have the money though
let's say you get a job because you're practicing at the tools and you make a livable salary
I consider that original four hundred thirty paid over multiple times yeah
I'm so old I am mature
I'm thinking about investments so overall my opinion this tablet is it's pretty great
my friends tell me
I should go more in depth my opinions because I'm someone who if they like something
I just kind of say yeah that's good but I genuinely mean it but summer is my reasons
I really love the size
I'm like
oh you showed me kindness
Gama for sending me this and goodbye
welcome to the world exclusive unboxing of the aqus 70 internet tablet
this is very affordable
it's it's half of the price of an iPad and it's less than half the price of a galaxy
tab - tab is 650 this is 250 and this is in the
US is 275 dollars

I'm not really sure you have some live wallpapers
you can launch some random random stuff you have email
well the only that parkus has made and here is the F cos 43
the high looks the only difference with the Galaxy
internet tablet this is a new capacitive internet tablet from F KERS
so let's check it out
let's go back here so there is of course a full
Google Marketplace
I'm going to go on a bunch of websites so you can see and gadget
yeah we're on my own home
Wi-Fi so this is the speed Hut looks like right here how about if I do like this
so this is a capacitive touchscreen
it's you don't need to
it doesn't work if you with nails and it's well it's capacitive so you have it
how does it work like this
I'm not very used to capacitive
let's go on another website here
I'm going to type in tech name did I click
we didn't click search
what is that
I hope it's not mobile
no okay so there everything is about the iPhone Apple iPhone Facebook
let's click carrot just the random article article
so how fast is this then
we can see this article learning so right now it's running
Android 2.1
this is just just a video
oh there's an article here like this
that's the guy who signed the contract and lost all his facebook stuff
you watched him cost billions
that's a bad scene
had what's the address of
I'm not used to capacitive
I told you already so
let's let's watch one or two videos
yeah like that
come back this in kind of
they have widget as well the way they did

I had a bunch of things running in the background
and you can
you can just stuff everything

it's just standard
Android everything standard
but actually this sound is muted for some reason
I don't know what why it's muted

this is this is what's what you get
I think it can fit in a jacket pocket
so you really get them massively big you get a huge
yeah huge huge internet in the pocket experience
thanks for watching this video
hello everybody those of you
who are looking for an alternative to the surface pro from Microsoft might be interested in this
I'm gonna go over everything that comes with the tablet
that looks a lot like an apple charger from a MacBook
the one thing that this tablet does not come with is the HP active pen
that's gonna cost you an extra 80 dollars all right now
let's move on to the review now with this tablet
you have a few processor options you can get it with a core i5 1.62 Hertz
processor all the way up to a core i7 1.9 gigahertz processor
the tablet does include the integrated intel graphics 620
GPU for storage it does include MDOT 2 solid state storage
AM you do have an integrated multi
array set of 3 microphones
I must say that this is one of the best tablet keyboards I have ever used
this is better than the surface
Pro's keyboard the trackpad is really nice and reminds me of that a B MacBook Pro
there's not as big of course but the look and feel of it is very close
the trackpad does support multi gesture so that is great
the keys are also very good
I read like this keyboard and I could truly say that
I actually enjoyed typing on this keyboard
the connector on top where it connects to the tablet is very similar to the surface pro
so nothing much to say there
let's take a closer look at the tablet itself on top
you do have a front facing five megapixel 1080p camera you also get an integrated
VGA IR camera with IR LED emitters that meets the Microsoft
hello face recognition certification
so you're able to log into the tablet easily with your face now
the tablet does come with an Intel dual band wireless AC with a 2x2 antenna and Bluetooth
4.2 it does have native marry cast wireless video support so those would be familiar with
meerkats know that you get in display
what's on your screen directly to devices such as a Roku that support the Marrakesh protocol
the tablet also supports a mobile broadband module without te and HSPA+ with GPS included
now let's talk about the options for the screen
the particular screen you see here is a 3k by 2k
IPS LED screen with the Corning Gorilla Glass 4 or you can get it with the optional
it also comes with
Corning Gorilla Glass 4
I recommend going with the 3k by 2k LED screen
instead okay
I mentioned the front facing camera now
I'm gonna talk about the back facing camera
and this camera is an 8 megapixel 1080p camera and on the right hand side
this is just a thin metal going around the side and the back portion
I didn't like about this kickstand
it's easy to lift ok now
looking at the top of the tablet
you don't have much on top
you do
have a couple microphones here and you do have the power button on top here
it is a little bit hard to see here but on the right side of the tablet
you do have your front facing right stereo speaker and on the left side here
you have your front facing left stereo speaker and the screen size of the HP lex-2 1013
d3 is 13 inches which is much bigger than the surface
Pro's screen size
you're looking for the left side of the tablet
you do have your combo headphone and mic 3.5
millimeter connection here
and next right here is where your nano
SIM port would be if you ordered your tablet with that configured
this is a low cost medium spec slate which will set you back just fifty dollars in the box
you'll find me
details new accounts can be created
and you're done
the seven inch screen has a 1024 by 600 pixel resolution at 171 pixels per inch
front and back cameras are included
4 le accelerometer and gyroscope extensors
the real magic behind the Amazon fire 7 is media consumption
Amazon's device is looked upon with envy by Apple and Microsoft
almost everything in this package is geared toward making money
shopping can also be easily achieved by simply opening the appropriate link to Amazon itself
you may prefer to simply buy this cheaper version
Amazon claims it is more rugged than the iPad Mini
7 is for media consumption
it does have its down site fire
OS 5 is clearly based on Android but could do some work with the user interface
one problem is the child account interface which is far less usable than the main
UI another is insistence of an internet connection to validate downloads from Amazon
Android overtalk ultimately the Amazon
Amazon fire 7
Hi everybody, how are you?
This is Rina and in today’s video I’ll be making a review of the tablet H610 pro ver.2 from Huion.
This tablet is a bit special because it can be connected and used on Android devices!
Without further ado, let’s get to it!
So this is the box
where it came, and inside we’ll find; the tablet
On the back it has those little ‘anti-slip mats on each corner so it stays steady on the table.
Let’s check some of the other stuff.
The pen. It has no batteries so we can forget about having to recharge it every now and then.
It’s very light, I’d say a bit more than the usuals you see on Wacom tablets.
Here’s the stand.
The hole on the back it’s the one we’ll use whenever we need to change the pen
nibs, and if we unscrew this part, inside we’ll find said extra nibs, safely stored.
And here are the OTG adapters that we’ll use to conect the tablet to an Android device.
First let’s see how it performs on the computer though.
and what do we want to download; either the drivers or the instructions.
Hit submit and go down the page to find the drivers.
And since it seems it’s become a tradition for me to share a new artwork
So here are the drivers.
Let’s go to where it says
Press Keys.
As you can see
If we want to change the shortcut it’s as easy as hitting the Erase Chain button,
click on the empty box and press the key we want to assign.
I almost forgot to mention that back when I first tried it
the tablet wouldn’t detect the shortcuts
the new shortcuts should work.
Let’s move onto the pen.
As you can see customizing the buttons works just the same way.
On the bottom box we can check that
On Work Area, if you are using only one monitor
you barely need to do anything here except for adjusting the active area
so it is proportioned to your monitor, in case you think you need that.
You can also change the position of the tablet if you’re left-handed.
If you’re using more than one monitor just make sure to choose the correct one up here.
Let’s make some quick tests with different programs.
I’m honestly very surprised, I didn’t stumble any problems making it work with any of these four.
So now let’s try to connect it to an Android device!
Oh, a wild Kai has appeared!
On the instructions it is mentioned that if the pen isn’t detected automatically
and it'll tell you how to do it.
Cons; on Android mode you can’t use any of the shortcuts and buttons sadly :’)
Theoretically it works with any type of drawing app but as you can see when I tried it on Medibang
the pressure didn’t seem to work
as it should, the strokes would come out the same no matter how much pressure I applied.
But on Ibis
Paint the pressure was much more precise.
Maybe it depends on the app and/or the model of the phone or tablet you’re using it with.
So after all that stuff let’s make a final test with a speedpaint.
obviously, about 25x16 cm (10x 6 inches).
Kind of the usual medium sized tablet.
The texture of the surface where we draw isn’t as toothy
as what we’d find on a wacom
or some other brands, it feels a bit more plastic like?
but not too much so don’t freak out.
The buttons for the shortcuts work
fine, both the tablet and then pen’s.
And as I mentioned before all the shortcuts seem to respond perfectly on any program.
that might require that option
Saying "I’m impressed" would be an understatement.
The Android mode, I think it’s great!
It’s not something I’d probably use but I know there’s a lot of artists that are interesting
in getting a tablet that could be connected to their phones to be able to draw comfortably.
The price; the H610 pro v2 costs around 60 euros (80 usd) at the moment.
The Intuos pro medium are of a similar size yet
they cost around 250 euros
(270 usd) aprox.
That’s four times the Huion’s price, plus those Intuos can’t be connected to Android devices yet.
So the verdict is; a very very nice tablet!
I can't stress how impressed I am at the pen’s sensitivity.
And we’ve reached the end of the review, I hope it was useful to all of you!
I’ll leave you the links down below to Huion’s website if you’d like to check it out.

what's in this box
let's find out very cool
a allow freebies check that out
awesome um this last shirt
zip that down now
let's get this thing open
so so what's in this thing that's cool showing love to um supporters
this is the tablet of the day ripping this one from what i feel already this
um this um tablet is really solid like a metal backplate
that feels really good
actually that's one of the buttons on the side
i'm sure that's on off switch
uh coming to um let's see what else giving a for it by the way i hope
yep well that's uh very soft sexy oh cool so not only
do you have a secondary on compartment
you also have these sections which are more than likely to hold the pin case and so forth
this definitely has some weight to it as well
these are very solid
like uh you have to feel them like this has some weight to it multiple 3d pen connectors
this is a note changer
i mean imagine constantly drawing day in day out with your natural oils from your hand
just um cooking up your space there
thank you so much for checking out this unboxing this has been blue with sdgt entertainment
until next time gamer you
hey guys today
I love trying out new art materials
so thank you
I'll be using my Mac laptop and I'll be painting a portrait in Photoshop
CC so I'll be showing my process for that as I share my review of the deco 0 3
this tablet comes with the tablet itself
a pen a pen holder
8 replacement nibs a USB
the working area is 10 inches
by five point
six two inches wide there are 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity
and you can use it whether you're left-handed or right-handed there's a dial and six customizable
I want to talk about what I really liked about this tablet
I really liked the size of the tablet
how it's a little longer than the typical tablet
I also really enjoyed how lightweight yet sturdy
I also love
how this tablet has the ability to go wireless
it's always nice to have one less cord in my life
the pen on the screen also felt good
it's not super scratchy or anything like that and with smooth on just a bit in
the lines just worked and flowed so working with Photoshop
felt quite natural to me
I also loved how this tablet came with this pen holder
my favorite part of this tablet though was the dial at first
it was just one quick swirl of the dial so
there were work arounds for this however like using a darker color than I actually needed then
I didn't have to work as hard to get that dark opacity
I could slowly ease up to my values and make these small incremental value changes easily
my final little struggle was that
I'm used to making the button on my pen
I couldn't program a keystroke plus a mouse
click for the pen button so instead
I think this is a great option
I really liked that
I'll definitely continue to use it with my laptop and Photoshop workflow
hey all care OS reviews
you're watching our hands-on review of a 8.5 inch LCD writing tablet now
the concept here was inspired by the boogie
there isn't an option to go in between so everything is wiped but with this version
you still need to use your camera for that so the packaging contents are extremely sparse
we have just a quick user manual and we have just the LCD writing tablet itself
it's actually soft and malleable
and this is literally the end that you use to wipe down any marks
we've seen but it gets a lot closer to the original boogie board as far as the color is concerned
so if we write something on the board here like OS reviews
you can see that the color here is kind of inverted it
OMA is a pale
greenish blue color
and it's a lot easier to make a mark on here
which is interesting
but you can't make as light marks on this one
it's a lot thinner compared to the same pressure here is going to be a bit brighter
alright so if
I'm done with this if I wanted to erase it
well completely you race it as you can see there
the erase function here is pretty cool
you have 30 seconds to you erase
I can tap on this
and you'll see a red red light start to flash and when the light is flashing
that's when you can erase elements from the page so using the erase tip
I can actually exert some pressure here and you can see that
it's actually doing a surprisingly good job of erasing very small
Manute elements that you've drawn on
it's not just smudging the paper
you have to use the eraser tip here
and that's where the magic kind of happens and everything seems to just instantly fade away
this is technically a pressure-sensitive tablet so it might not be as good as say a
and you're able to maybe create some more realistic doodles and heart work
it's kind of easy to make marks on this one
it's a bit prone to accidental markings
if you're not careful which is why
so they wanted you to just get a new board when the battery died so this is a extra feature now
there are no magnets on the back of this model
I can tap on the race
nothing happens partial
you race also doesn't work that's pretty much it
the premise here is very much simple
it's a replacement for paper and finally
it's a version
it doesn't cost too much back in the early days when the boogie board technology first came out
they were actually pretty expensive
I think that it's kind of an underrated technology
thanks for watching that's been the 8.5 inch LCD writing tablet with partial you race
hey guys so
can you get a good
Windows 10 experience on the device
it feels quite a robust tablet
you know it's not the most premium feeling tablet
it is using kind of like a rubberized texture though so it feels quite grippy
there's quite a lot of expandability options on the tablet
you can see
we're getting a dock here for keyboard expansion on the other side
I was concerned about though is the display which is I think 1280 by 720 pixels per inch
I have too happy to say that it does the job
when you are looking at it head-on now look here
it's really the web browsing here
so if we have a look at something here so you can see the content
let me just actually do something here
not not the strongest viewing angles here if you used to see like your smartphone displays
you know but nothing special really they could also
I think you've improved the brightness there
it's not the brightest display
I think it's an act on processor but the main issue I actually have noticed with
this tablet is in terms of the the Wi-Fi strength which to me doesn't seem to be that good really
I think the Wi-Fi is the main kind of issue here with this tablet
it's not that strong doesn't have 5g support as well to you know where get quick downloads
and things like that
the camera it has got one on it is 2 megapixel and you
can you know basically take a few shots here as you can see
it should be able to handle that pretty well
this is a solid tablet
hi I'm Paul
the frugal tack welcome to my channel this
Black Friday I picked up this RCA 7-inch Voyager tablet for 28 bucks at Walmart
now after checking out different tablets
I've realized that the 7 inch size is the perfect handheld size
anything bigger than that is gonna require a two hand hold 7 inch cheapo
tablets are rebranded with the same exact specs
A that's a samsung galaxy
and you're gonna have a higher screen resolution that than what's on this
there was another tablet
I saw available the Samsung Tab Lite II
that is not a galaxy tablet okay
it's called the tab light a
there's a huge difference
depending on your needs as far as the resolution goes with these cheapo tablets
I play a lot of online chess
and you know my chessboard
looks great on this
but just understand that in this thirty to seventy dollar price range
they are all exactly the same specs
I think they're just the same rebranded product if you enjoyed the video

hello and welcome to a new video
I'm here to review my XP pen star
oh three graphics tablet
I mention it
it cost me just shy of 60 euros
which for a 10 by 6 inch tablet is more than good in my opinion
it's twice the size of my old
the pen has buttons on side to toggle between pen and eraser or other functions
since you can just rebind it to whatever you need
the tablet itself has 8 hotkeys
I had to do specifically to make it work in
probably the biggest issue
oh the other ones are just tiny minor things like and being scratchy
I personally regret is not buying a protector
that doesn't come over screen and that the pen doesn't have an eraser though
who's looking for a tablet so yeah
I'm just gonna go over the specs again
it is six by ten inch or ten by six
however you want to go about this and has a diagonal of 11 inch
it's like an eleven and a half almost 12 inch tablet
it has eight buttons that you can customize however you want it comes with a pen that is
that doesn't need to be recharged
it just works
it comes with like eight nibs by default
I don't have the pen holder that came of it when I first got it
you can place the pen on it or stick it in it
it's kind of really nice and if you screw it open that's where the extra pen nibs are
yeah it has 2048 levels of pen pressure costs less than 60 euros in most countries
and yeah it's it gets kind of scratchy so by screen protector
if you're gonna buy it and it's good for what it is
my opinion the buttons on the side have brush enhance weighting zoom in zoom out
Hansol hand to brush to erase
so that's what I suggest you do
it's very affordable suits most people easy to install and compatible for most computers
I'm currently using it on a Windows
tablet sales are no questions slowing down and Samsung themselves
haven't even updated some their other flagship
tablets they no pro in
Tab pro series nonetheless
we finally have the
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room
welcome everyone to another review going over the physical features first two things
you'll notice right from the get-go it's crazy thin and crazy lightweight and the funny thing
I said the same thing last year when they finished tablets were introduced
how much thinner can these things get
Samsung has finally incorporated an aluminum bezel
and it's a nice touch
the a tab as two back sides are slightly beveled and although it is such a small design idea
it's about the experience and the little details like this
that gives an overall impression when you first pick it up
I personally love this
but let's go around the physical features here starting at the top
Samsung gets rid of the IR blaster
which of last year's model allows you to control your TV with your device
now moving through the right side very cliquey power
SD card slot with the tab
I am glad the Samsung kept considering that both of their flagship phones have done away with them
my biggest gripe
I'm sure due to engineering constraints
charging port justify to the right the 3.5 millimeter headphone ports
on the left hand side
and as you can see these speakers are very much spaced apart for portrait mode
it's no problems at all
but in landscape there is no question that you're blocking the bottom speaker with your palm
there's nothing on the left side of the tablet but rotating to the back
it is plastic with an aluminum paint light texture
Samsung obviously didn't go full aluminum which is fine by me
but the build quality all around is still very well done
2 but shockingly
the fine letters are just not as crisp
I guess to compare to the other model for the average consumer
wow factor but the resolution is still done well
so yes those heavy into watching movies and widescreen formats
the system specs are on your screen according to tech times comm
Samsung is not using their latest processor
found in these
Samsung phones the Exynos 7420 but it is using the processor found in the samsung galaxy note
4 the Exynos 5433 indeed
it is an older processor with quotes around the word older
it is still no slouch either
of course it's not as energy-efficient roughly a 10% slower clock speed or so and the
Tab s2 is using the familiar ddr3 ram while the newer phones are using the latest ddr4
this is still very zippy in a very fast device and we're world use
another feature is from the home page
you can swipe left in
zippy and fast for all of your needs regarding battery performance
I ran two movies and then the following day tested
some games downloaded some more apps
here and of course left the tablet on standby overnight
total time is one day in 28 minutes and screen on time was eight hours and one minute
I was shocked that Samsung did not advance on
I'll be honest
here the heir to Samsung still offers more features and I still believe
it's a great design but when you compare
maybe they knew that
the build is still fantastic despite that SD card readers slot now
I'm Jimmy wood Jim's review room
you guys take care and I see in the next one
hey everyone welcome back to another video in this video
this is 100% my own opinion of the product
so let's take a look inside
shall we alright so first thing
this is what it looks like outside the case and it has hot key buttons at the top
if you prefer to use them next is a hand glove to protect your tablet from your hand greases
next is a pen that does not require a battery
and that's what's in the case
there's also a special edition tablet
that is exactly the same tablet that I just unboxed but it has like a banana
duck image on the top of the tablet and it comes with stickers but even though it was cute
I used the pen tablet on and off for about two weeks while working on this image
you see me doing here and so
I think I have used it enough to state the pros and cons about it
Wacom pen tablet or even better
it has the same drying space as the
Wacom Bamboo
but there's a few hotkeys that you can press for tool shortcuts
and it's by far much more affordable plus
a lot quicker it is a must for speed and also
well that a normal pen tablet should do so
I had no problems the only somewhat con that I found with it which isn't much of a con at all
is that even though the hotkey buttons for the art tool shortcuts were available on the tablet
the other problem
they will save you life
they did me a lot of time
and lastly just to quickly talk about the image you see me working on
so that's what I did
I didn't record the line art part because I wanted to mainly focus on the tablet usage
part and that's because
I prefer coloring with these types of pen tablets rather than drawing with them
I just find it to be easier that way for me anyway to wrap this up
so if your if you'd like to purchase the tablet
I'll leave a link in the description box below
and if you'd like the shirt
I'll also leave a link to that as well
so yeah
that's pretty much all
I have to say about this pen tablet
alright that's it
I hope you guys enjoyed the review and I hope you all have a good one take care you
so guys Lindsay and in this video I am going to unbox this box as you can see
I have a tablet inside of it and to be honest with you guys
I'm going to go and check this out
this is actually the tablet that we have here
and it's we pronounce this this is X kadhi kadhi tablet PC
and the back of it
also this is a 16 gig tablet and the charger should be 5 volts 2 amps also to let you know as well
this tablet can work with micro
SD card so I am going to go and turn on so this is actually the first very very first
this is actually the very very force start of that
we can see just took place with this tablet and as you can see this is actually ideal for children
we have some ups here
we have camera actually kids desktop
we can exit this by going here
we just exited the kids login there
we also have grown-ups only so 5 plus 19
this is the official system of the tablet
we have photos
we have also half please two as well so guys
we can download our own apps and up here
we can download whatsapp we can do with Facebook Instagram
and all of those are the apps that you saw enjoy
if you want to go back to the children system layout you will need to go to here
i wanna so when you go to a one
this is actually the children desktop so we can go in
we can play with these children apps
if you want to go out we can go back
we can go here
and then we good to go here we are in the official
so that's the beauty that I like about this
so let me go into settings which as you can see we have 16 gigs and already used five point
five which is consists of the Android system and this tablet is a very reasonable tablet
I should say for those of you who have children and would want them to enjoy
I am going to go to the settings
I'm going to look for that
I'm going to give you the model number which is T 9 0 1
so that's the model number
the processor type is quite cool
a 33 this is also android 6.0.1 so guys it's the IB laptop
I hope that is with yourself or to you and again guys the camera as well
it's you know better than most tablet
my name is lens
I hope that this was helpful
if you guys are looking for one of these to buy
all right this is the review of the arcus generation 8
it just arrived
you can see here the the this is the new
F cos 43 internet tablet
which is the newest compact pocket-sized full
Android experience a very very powerful device with a very fast
the latest on cortex a8 45
PMP with the Wi-Fi connection inside
and then this one came in 2006
the six or five which was had the same screen size as this
they actually have the same screen size
now right now they are going to release it right now
$1.99 the idea of this device is to compete with that
this diaper touch is actually
it's an iPhone but it's the same iPod Touch
and the idea is that this is to 2:39 or 229 for 8 gigabytes this is $1.99 for 16 gigabytes
and you see you get a bigger screen
let me just turn it on like this right here
I don't know it works something like that
you see you get a bigger screen a much bigger screen
but it's not really
it's not heavier
I'm a kind of a slow ruler
let's go to and gadget type
something else drug intervention no
I don't need that and gadget all right
we get down to the bottom and we load the food and get it experience
and you're gonna see it's gonna load pretty fast so as I was saying right here
I'm on a Wi-Fi ji a slow ruler so I need to upgrade the ruler or I get somewhere else where I can
if you're close enough you can maybe see that
it's actually readable in full full
width of the screen
you can maybe zoom in once you don't even need to zoom in once if you don't it's fine and this
Corning is fast and it's totally readable
you don't need like some super crazy
high resolution and stuff
so it's gonna load the share folder
it should load or at least before
I was doing it through the phone
farbros there
yeah there's a list of like
I can have access to 2 terabytes of the movie
so there's built in 16 gigs
you can add a microSD and there's HDMI output that
it might not take very long time to charger and pure need to test
how long it takes
I plugged it before
it went from 42 percent to 99 99 percent charging
it took like less an hour so
I looks there is this which I've tested already and Aoife
it supports 3d games
there's a nice big
this speaker is free now and then you can play
some 3d games branches 3d games
you've seen that before and I'm really really good at this game
does everybody else say they're not pretty good
I'm very good as you can see
I will overtake everybody
let's see if we can
I think I transferred some some apk just to show you so if I exit
it's an apk file
I just login to my name boos I need to login and then I have access to Skype in theory
right here and this is using the oculus 43 as a mouse so
I'm going to go into my website the Archos fans that come is browsing in a
it looks to me like a 720p browsing browser basically the the android web browser
I can go in favorites
I can load
the best way is not of course retina
I'm I'm sitting next to the HDTV
is that exactly the way to do
there's a full
it's just awesome
HD browser and I'm really looking forward to I should get a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse
I'm looking forward to that
I just need to go and get one and I'll make another video when I have that
maybe you can even resume enabled optimize for HD HD HD so that was mind-blowing
so right now it's outputting
I had a problem connecting the Samba file share so
so you can see that
it's 720p video that works alright
you're not gonna put too much of it because then
YouTube is gonna ban my video and I'm gonna try and go back to on a play recording right now
the last is on the top okay camcorder mode for McGee per second
which is the most compressed 723 camcorder that I love
usually it my camcorder
this where camcorder is recording 9 mega bit per second for 720 so I put it down
it and performativity can even go lower than that
I don't know how haha the resolution is of this picture for example
then we can see over here
it's much better to use a mouse and a keyboard
thanks for watching
hi everyone cynics of Syria with chewy iPad ltd tablet
the tablet is powered by a decocker magitek annual x7 processor
let's go to
CPU said quickly with three gigabyte
RAM with 3gb of ram 32
gigabyte storage on a 10 inch
10.1 inch display so performance is quite good
SC Wi-Fi or so none has Wi-Fi five now and performance of Wi-Fi is very good
no problem with this connection while
I'm at the wireless spot
is the camera
there is not much to see
there is a phone camera and the rear camera
the speaker is good
I tested battery life with this app and performance is good much better than previous tablets
I tried and similar to my show me a one and A two phones
it lasts eight hours in a PC
Mac I'm not sure you can see you cannot see
I will rest a little over eight hours
that's very good other feature that works well is
GPS okay okay and we get a fix almost immediately
let's try some games
let's go easy with candy crush saga first
the speakers are not the best
I want to do the job
you may want to connect external speakers is soft
okay so you get it
this one is no problem
I also try BB racing and Riptide gp2
okay let's go to video racing quickly have a look
okay so we get the idea
this one is good
Riptide gp2 is not too bad
but let's go to the game where
I start to struggle a bit
CSR racing - okay
we have to be patient because this game loads quite slow on all platforms
I've used okay
let me rest a little bit
I'll connect the keyboard
there is a keyboard as well
oops okay so this game is terrible by singing we lost over show you
I sing ever
it's not very smooth and it's a bit too big to play this game okay
I want to be asked to check the multi-touch so let's go
okay so okay this one we show that
sometimes we miss key prices but on the up keyboard
you won't have any such problems
I haven't used a keyboard a lot because it's not something I enjoy with Android
okay so let me take it out to bring up the soft keyboard
let's delete it and I will try to type you see I press them
I had to press twice okay
d I have to press again so there was three times
I had to press twice because it didn't register on my key press
it's pretty good
web browsing is good
some light gaming is good so you may
you may consider this tablet
alright thanks for watching bye bye
hello everybody thank you for tuning in to another episode of not analog comm today
I'm looking at the Toshiba
8100 tablet a tea
not a tea
now this is a 10 inch or 10.1
it's got the
Tegra Nvidia processor built in
which is a 1 gigahertz processor
it's got quite a bit of grunt
it's a little bit thicker than the most tablets that are out there it does run
Android so I didn't mention that runs Android 3.1 honeycomb which is good
I currently use an Android tablet so this was an easy one to get familiar with
and even if it's the first time you're using one it's very simple
I think all right that accidentally one day and a microphone microphone jack or an headphones
so you can plug your headset in as well as the charging port and on this side
that looks like there's a dock connector site
if you get a doc for this tablet anyway you can dock it there in a nutshell
that is what it looks like on the outside
they kind of add their own apps to it but before
I do you'll notice the size of the bezel on the side
I guess that really adds to the thickness when you do
turn the tablet on okay when you turn the tablet on okay
you'll see it look quite a bit of room here and even if it's just to protect my thumb
I think it's a little bit too thick
I know for example the Motorola Xoom is a lot of thinner
just an observation
besides that that the screen is actually quite good
I do think that it was built for you to hold it this way
I mean you look at where they've put this where they put this camera and that camera
it kind of feels like this is what they wanted so
I just realized why I won't tell because I've got the screen locked
so that's what these locking mechanisms do
I yeah each to their own
someone gonna love it some are gonna hate it
I guess maybe make that the CAO button
because it's at least
I know I'm only going to touch the one button there
okay so let's have a look at the inside of this thing
alright so we are looking at the this tablet you can see what
I mean with the whole thumb issue
I can easily cover the camera there
I did was sign in with my Google account and a straight
oh my mail my my talk
which is fantastic when I go into the apps
you'll here's some of the key differences
sorry about the lighting
so the key difference is they've added some apps which is sort of a lot better than
Docs to go and things like that
like the calc app which is you know your spreadsheets and things like that
you know it's like two minute later
so same thing with powerpoints called show and there is one for word
I guess your eternity to worry which is called right exact same exact same sort of thing
I think it's a great addition to the Android tablet
furthermore there's also a file manager so most of them do have this now
these little photos that are on the device so not ones that are actually on
Picasa so really cool muscle interface for the media player
I noticed there was something else June
wiki and printer share
so you can
Wi-Fi Bluetooth whatever you need to do so I think that's super super cool
they were just added some great little features
I really think that you know
you know there's now
you know obviously navigation so
I just think that cameras in a really annoying spot
obviously when you turn it this way
I'm kind of rushing maybe but I don't think that I don't want to
because that's where most
you know those sort of things really are changing the game
changing the cub is making a bit more personal
I think that that really helps also
I just think it's a little big you know
I think that with what's out
there is hard for this tablet to be competitive
I just think it's a little expensive for what it is based on its dimensions
I think I wouldn't want to carry this around every day
it's just a bit too bulky and this bezel thing
I think they just could have used the screen a bit better
great because let's think about it you create a document on the laptop sync it up to Google Google
Docs but it's going to be right here
work on it on the on your couch
whatever you want save it back your laptop super easy and
I think it's just a really cool way of doing it
add for people who are buying if buying a laptop you get this for free score
I think that's a really good way of of selling a laptop as well overall
it is a good tablet
I'm not gonna say it's terrible
just not the sexiest thing
I'm doing it for charity
I'll put the link up if you would like to donate as well
thanks for watching guys
we'll speak to you soon
Hello everyone, and welcome to this review video of the XP-PEN G640.
Let's get right into the unboxing.
So the package comes with the tablet itself in a cute fancy little wrapping.
Even if it seems kind of "too much", that's actually a very good specificity
to have because
I don't know for you guys, but I always end up either
losing or breaking all my pen nibs, in fact
I wear them quite fast as I drag unlike most top players
I can think of, so yeah, that's a huge advantage for me and other drag players.
Alright so the first thing we're gonna do after plugging
our tablet is downloading the proper drivers on the company's official website.
There's our driver.
After downloading it, install the right driver according to your OS.
It's not specified anywhere but I suggest you reboot your computer just in case.
Now you should see this icon on your Desktop.
From here you can pretty much configure your tablet
however you want.
and your frame will drop a bit
I don't really know why, so I suggest you disable both of these.
Also, make sure to disable Windows Ink, that shit is not good.
Alright, we're ready to play with it to see how it feels now.
I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised
by the absence of input lag combined with the nice touch the surface had to offer.
Also, thanks to these little rubber thingy there, the tablet sticks quite firmly to the desk.
No matter what.
You can find a more complete list of specification on the company's website, although I doubt osu!
players are interested in anything other than the active area
and the pen's accuracy, but here you go.
One thing I have to add about it however, is that it gets dirty very easily, and I weigh my words.
You see these things there and there?
That is sweat.
So yeah, if you have sweaty hands like mine, you'll have to keep it clean and well maintained...
And finally, the load of spare pen
nibs it comes with, that's truely the cherry on the cake for me as a drag player.
However this tablet is far from perfect.
As I already mentionned, its surface gets nasty
The price is also quite high
And finally, and for me that's the biggest drawback, the pen button
I don't have anything else to add on this tablet, I hope you enjoyed this
this thing is metal on the back plastic on the top and the bottom
it doesn't feel super premium or anything
I will say that the one thing
that kind of sucks about this tablet
I guess not about this huh
the back of your hand starts sweating
I don't like that I actually bought a matte screen protector for this tablet
that way
just kind of sucks especially when your hands are sweating so
I bought a Mac screen protector for that
that's just one area that I don't like about this
the rest of it is actually
okay um
I will say that my hands are fairly small
you can't really tell from the video but when I'm carrying it I kind of like carrying my tablets
it's just an observation big hands
you're good small hands not so good and I would say most most guys hands are bigger than mine
it's not ambled
it has a resolution of about 1920 by 1200 so it's actually a pretty good resolution
I'm reading comics
everything looks pretty good
let me just go to something colorful
ah we go to Asterix and Obelix
um anyway let me show you color in some other place
then yeah the the color here is okay
I will say that I don't really have much of a
I don't have much or many complaints about the color here
my cell phone is actually an AMOLED display so I kind of used to that
the color here is a little bit a little bit more washed out
and you're looking at tales of demons and gods the manga
it looks good um again
yeah no complaints
I'm in a room right now
granted my recording room is a little bit brighter than most other rooms
it's perfectly viewable indoors but outdoors not so much because in outdoors
you really can't see this very well and you got clear here
watch this see that see
it's not horrible
it's not amazing
this one is a touch below that
that could be it but again touch sensitivity
I'm mostly okay with that
okay moving on to audio
I've showed you guys adventures before the audio sound so now I'll show you this one again
they shop in three two one
I'll say it's barely passable in terms of the face
the rest of the audio is again
it's it's really whatever when
yeah so on this
so what is it about this that
yeah not fast at all you got your mediatek helio
P 22 T 4 gigs 64 gigs and a 1920 by 1200 resolution speed wise
it's really nothing special in fact the Android unit I have in
I think this should be about the same so in terms of like swiping and stuff like that
it's not good as you can see
there's like a little bit of lag when you're swiping to Google
now when you're starting up it's ok you swiping down
it's it's a little bit jumpy put it that way
Chrome that was that was decent
put it that way there was decent
it's still not super fast but it was you know passable
let me launch something else
so let you guys see let's say
I launched YouTube
oh actually already had that open
let's let's launch
YouTube by itself like they're the original YouTube app
and yeah you can see that was
that was whatever it wasn't that fast either candy crush
I mean I can live with that kind of speed but again it's it's not super fast
okay before we move on to you
know the rest of the tablet
I want to talk about the one area of this tablet that is the reason why I like it so much
even though the rest of the tablet really isn't that great and that's gonna be bad news life
the value of life on this thing is insane
I I was
this was completely out of left field
I did not expect the battery life to be this good at all
I think yesterday I used it for I think 10 hours
it was a mix of manga so not super intense but yeah so manga as well as candy crush
I think it was
yeah so mix of manga and candy crush
that's probably the reason why
that's one of the reasons why
I like it okay moving on bluetooth and Wi-Fi both work there
I didn't see any issues with them in terms of reception and range the location though
sorry about that okay moving on to a gaming so
I think I played for you guys
I felt extreme already but I'll play it one more time old
I'll use a different race track this time
so it's a bit more interesting but again with gaming it's it's actually
I'm good because the mediatek helio p22 tee
I don't know why that popped up again the Hilo p22 tea actually is a fairly decent chip for gaming
it's just really bad for like swiping around in your home screen so okay alright
let's go again
I've never I've never really been a huge gamer
it's a very old crap
I died
it's really hard to talk and game at the same time
so that's why they have to make sure that the games work on from low end to high end devices
so yeah if you want a game you won't have a problem in this case so yeah okay
let's move on to a pub
G Arness right now
Club G candy crush candy crush okay
whatever same price
let's go and as you can see candy crush works very well and it's also super addicting
very very addicting
I think I wind myself off candy crush for a while
and then and then he just came back with a vengeance
finally talking about the camera on this thing
I don't get why tablet manufacturers still putting cameras in their tablets
it's stupid and just bad quality both the front and the back camera
oh my goodness it's so so bad
I I couldn't believe it
I remember seeing advertisements on little was website for this tablet and they said Oh
our camera is so good and then
I looked at the pictures I took and I was like no
I mean you guys still got a long way to go on this
okay alright guys
that was pretty much it for the review of the lenovo tab now me
I'm trying to remember if I've missed anything and I actually do remember
I did miss something
charging this tablet takes forever with the included charger
I don't think fast charge actually
I don't think this thing supports a fast charge and that microUSB port oh my goodness
do i recommends this tablet
that's hard to say because for myself i love it
i mainly use it to read comics and read manga and the long battery
life is a huge feature on this like a huge feature
I said it I used it for 10 hours
you don't need a great tablet
put it that way alright
that's it for this review
I hope you guys liked it and I'll see you guys in the next one
hi this is kayla from pakka blocks comm today
i'm going to review this graphics
tablet this is the way on h6 1-0 pro this is the competitor to Wacom Intuos tablet
I have read a lot of reviews regarding this tablet online
some say that it's very good
some data is not that good so today
I'm going to review this and show you how it is when it comes to drawing on different programs
let's talk about the hardware
first for this particular tablet it supports 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity
here there are some buttons that have been pre-programmed with keyboard shortcuts
and there's this little hand too there are also additional shortcuts here
I can press them without looking at them
this is much more convenient
the buttons they are quite firm and they work very well this buttons by the way
they are programmed for photoshop
you have to plug this into your computer using a USB port this is the USB port
it's those pots that
I use by canon scanner so you can share the cables
this is actually a cable from my canon scam scanner
the light will stay on
let me show you the driver and some of the settings that you can change
this is tablet driver version
v 11.0 point 8
some of the things you can change our the button functions on the stylus
there are two buttons here so you can change them to different settings
for example mouse click left right needle or a specific keyboard key
I will I normally leave this at default you can also change the pressure sensitivity
there is no usually for discount drivers
I'm using a 4k monitor
so this by the way will be at default
you will set it to your monitor
this is the mapping area
it's pretty straightforward
as for the pen
this is battery power so you do need to charge it and to charge it there
is this little charging pot here at the back
the pen feels quite light and I think if used a bit cheaper it is quite quite strong
just that is it's very light so depending on your drawing preference
sometimes you may like a heavier pen sometimes you like appendage light personally
I like pen
that is as light as a pencil
this is the tip and this is replaceable
let me show you the stand
that comes with the pen
this is the stand
I think there is a bottom at the stem
yes there is the bottom
this is the bottom and it comes with four replacement nibs and there
power for this pen is very good
this is photoshop
so you can see the cursor moving around here
I'm just going to show you some very quick very feet
hashing lines so this tablet is actually quite sensitive
that is good friction
there is good control
and if you press down hard you can see that the lines
they taper quite smoothly as well and they taper very gradually
it really depends on what kind of lines you want
so let's
I'll try some thick and thin lines to show you now
I know we don't have that some of them
especially the pen display monitors
you know those wanting tests where you can draw on
sometimes they have problems
we have drawing smooth lines but here we've just had that the lines here are really very smooth
the drivers are downloaded from prions website
so this is pretty standard
let's switch over to another software called MIDI Bank paint
this is a free drawing software
let me just create a new file and try to and launch this alright
let me choose this pen here and show it to you
alright okay
I think there is some problem with this particular software as I lift up the pen
the lines still continue to come out so now on
my pen is on the surface now
my pen is off the surface and you can see that this line is still going and once
I lift it far away from the surface it stops so this is very problematic
this is unusable in me dying paint
let's try
I've drawn something
that's um do some very quick strokes again
tablet looks fine with mischief
let's see what out of software do
I have I think that's almost all the software that I have for the shop
it works very well on mischief the software
this is called sketches blue pro
this is actually an iPad app but it also have a version for Mac OS so
let's try this
they are predictable
they go where
I want em to be so
yeah this is one
this is sketches
Pro and it works
fine let's do a recap on the pros and cons of this tablet
the beaut quality is actually quite good
I also like the buttons on the left side
however you can reassign them if you want to
the drawing surface has a nice matte texture to it
so when you use your pen on this surface it gives you that slight texture
this is actually very similar to work on tablets and as for the cons
I wasn't able to test this up tablet with all the drawing software available of course
but we've found the software that I showed you earlier
some of them work
some of them do not work
so if you really do want buy this tablet
I think that's the probably the biggest con to this tablet
and lastly the pricing
I bought this around 70 to 80 US dollar
this is a so-called medium sized tablet so this is slightly larger than e5 if you were to buy a
Wacom tablet at this size
it's usually 2 times as much so that's 160 dollars
there are balls so for us $80
I think is still worth it especially if you want to buy this for use with Photoshop
yeah so that's over my review today
if you have any questions feel free to post them in the comment section below
our program reviews sketching tips and tutorials bye you
yo like this video now
it should be good enough for most people but since my desktop is under my desk
I used a different USB to fix the problem
I'll put a USB link in the description for those who struggle with this issue
lastly the package comes with a nib removal tool with three replacement nibs
next let's talk about the driver while you can download the
Welcome driver from their website
I still decided to use the tablet driver created by
you can change tablet area and both drivers which limits or expands the play area of your tablet
I show you that raw juicy gameplay let me talk about how the CTL 472 is for
os-- it's great
I find it very good for both drag and hover and I can even do a little bit of the tap x-play style
it doesn't take up much space and I am really really satisfied with the $60 price point
okay so let's get on to the gameplay come on
Kari all the top of all the top of everything bossing there bossing even that gets worried
yeah little wispy suppose
I mean if they're playing maplestory is spending money on it
they're probably rich anyway because cute louder buddy
Jesus before light pulses it was me quiet
I don't care wow I'm at
it just came out rolling girl by various artists
I'm number five on the board
I am reviewing one
I'm really excited to start this
they have given me the in spy in spy
what am the heat
one one
I was greeted by a cute little as saying
thank you for buying that tablet
I really liked the idea of having a little Frankie Lera
it's really cute next in the box is of course the tablet it was so much bigger than I expected
honestly because it's bigger than the tablet
I'm not losing them because I have no idea what might have a double pink pen
loads off next is the pen
this is only really cool
there's a paperwork first
the driver was quick to install so
put out
just enjoy the speed plate with me drawing with it
this turned out way better than expected
hey everybody welcome back to art by
Galen I'm Galen Island felt and today I've got a little product review for you
I was sent some tech to review by who young they sent me this
Inspira H 950 P which is one of their more popular pen tablets
and it's been a long time since
I've actually used a tablet
that isn't a display so
I'm excited to see how this stacks up against what I currently use
I currently use a Cintiq 22 HD
I'm really excited to try with this
I'm gonna take this
some of the specs for this
the working area inside the tablet is 5.4 inches by eight point seven inches
so having an undo button is pretty nice
I like having a button to save and I like having buttons that allow me to zoom in out
now this also comes with some little adapters that allow you to plug this in to your
Android phone or tablet and use it in art programs that you have on those and that's another thing
I'm really excited to try out now before I get started
I have to download the driver
and that's as simple as going to hooey on tablet comm slash support
and then just finding your device
in our case it's the in spheroid
H 950 P with the tilt and I'm gonna download the driver for Windows
ok so after working with this for a little while
I I gotta say I'm really impressed with this tablet and coming from me
I'm typically a person who I tend to stand by Wacom products because I've I've used them for years
there is no power cable
connect this to it
it feels very flimsy to me
it's not it's not heavy
it doesn't have enough weight to it
so who would I recommend this to
that's looking to get new tablet
you can't really beat it
a lot of you guys already know star g6 40 it is
it's also going to have six customizable buttons so you can program it
how much ever what you want it's going to have increased pressure sensitivity for your pen
it's also going to you know
do both hands covered
which means you can use your left hand for multi purposes
it's also going to be also friendly
which means that
the tabla is gonna be plug-and-play
let's get to the unboxing of star g6 40s by XV pen
I'll be using a box cutter to open the tape
it says please visit XP Pen website to download the latest driver
remove the box cover
I think my wife game is broken
I'll have to replace that pretty soon as we open this up
we're going to be greeted with the pen
we're gonna talk about that
I've actually been a little bit different this time as a 90 degree bent cable style
cable management tied thingy which is also a nice touch this
that we don't really care too much about this is thank you for supporting letter
a warranty card
a warranty policy booklet a warranty extension card and a small quick guide
which you probably won't need also now we're going to be looking at the tablet pen
I'll also bring my CTO for 80 pound for comparison as you can see
they're almost all equal in size
not really too much of a difference
there's also a s 640 pen for good measure
why not write and also to add more will have a galvan
AP 20 rechargeable pen just kidding
I hate this pen
going back to the p0
v pest pen for xc10 g6 40s tablet
the pen tip is nice and clicky nothing too special really and rubbery grip is what
I really wanted to talk about
it's going to hopefully help with the slipperiness of the tablet
the rubber is actually pretty grippy
I thought that was gonna be a bit of a concern but as I'm speaking right now
hopefully it's going to help make sure that the tablet doesn't slide around too much to drink
also painfully as you can see on the left side there are six customizable buttons
it's not like ultra thin like the g6 40 or gamma s 56k
but it really doesn't matter too much
the connector is gonna be on the left side of the tablet
might you know wonder if that's going to be interfering with the keyboard
comparison as you can kind of see
the height is almost the same for XP pengie 640 and the XP pengie 640 s
it becomes more apparent when you overlap
it and the active area is supposed to be small on the g6
I don't know what happened there
oh yeah and apparently this is covered in plastic
you go for the g6
40s tablet driver which is third row down
actually fourth row
down in this case can go ahead and click download
wait for it to finish
I'm clicking between you know the full area and the forceful portions
what's better is that now when you click this one on the right
this is my piece of paper
you say right here on the top left corner and right here on the bottom right corner
I just wanted to give you guys some of my final thoughts on this tablet g6 40s by XP pen
this tablet does not have any rough surfaces
its finishes are very well
made the tablet surface looks nice and clean overall
this is something like that
you can just have it out all the time and be like
hey this is a tablet that
I use it looks nice and it will also look nice to other people too
as for the price thing the g6 40s is currently sitting at 45
US dollars on Amazon this to some people maybe a little bit more pricey compared to
for me personally
I believe spending the extra 10 dollars for the better build
that wasn't the case for this pen
which was a big plus
40s was the perfect balance between smoothness and latency
I believe exactly the same being replicated on the g4 g6
40s was a huge plus for me and as for the final verdict
give this tablet a solid 5 stars
really nothing's holding this tablet back at all if anything
of course you know
everything is preferential in the world of tablet
your tablet pen preference can be different

okay I'm gonna get going now
it's 6:30 a.m.
- [Aaron] The Wacom One is Wacom's most affordable display tablet to date.
As always, all opinions in this video are my own.
(pen scribbling) Now if the name Wacom One sounds familiar, you're not the only one.
See what I did there?
Repeating names for multiple products seems to happen a lot at Wacom.
Personally, I would have called it Wacom Two, but I digress.
In 2019 Wacom released the Cintiq 16
This is great news for artists
The Wacom One is lean and mean.
It has the essentials you need to make digital art and not much else.
So let's dive into this device and take a look at some of the specs.
I'll also do some painting on this device so you can see how it performs.
The screen measure is 11.6 inch wide by 6.5 inches tall.
It's 13.3 inches diagonally.
So it's not the best screen in terms of clarity or color accuracy
but it will do the trick.
The Wacom One is using an AHVA display with a Wacom EMR digitizer
like you might see in a tablet like the Samsung Galaxy Note. There is no touch capability.
I wouldn't even bother trying.
And there is a matte anti-glare film applied to the tablet.
The film is applied very well without any bubbles or edges peeling off.
This bezel design is a lot closer to the Pro Cintiqs in terms of bezel width.
The bezel design of the Wacom
One is much closer to the Cintiq Pro models which I like.
Now let's discuss the pen.
The pen has over 4000 pressure levels
which is more than adequate for drawing and painting.
The pen resolution is 2540 lpi.
Pen tilt is supported which is great.
Even with the more budget minded tablets
Wacom is offering, you're still getting a top-of-the-line pen experience.
The pen is lighter and smaller than the Pro pens and similar in
look and feel to the one that comes with the Intuos.
The pen only has one button rather than two, and it does not have an eraser.
There are three spare nibs hiding behind legs.
As far as using other pens on the Wacom One, the Wacom One does not support other
Wacom pens like the Art Pen or the Pro Pen
2. But it does support other types of EMR pens.
I have this STAEDTLER, Noris digital pen
which looks a lot like a pencil and it works great on the Wacom One.
I can even vary the width of my line by pressing harder or lighter.
There are a few other pens that are supported and more pen
brands will be added in the future.
The line tests with the Staedtler Pencil are great too.
I notice that the Staedtler Pencil grips the surface more.
I prefer the feel of the Wacom pen, but the Staedtler Pencil could be a nice option
perhaps for note taking or sketching.
Having a button on the pen is definitely useful too.
Now let's move on to discuss the build quality of the Wacom One.
The device itself is 8.9 inches by 14.1 inches with a thickness of 0.6 inches.
It's very lightweight at only 2.2 pounds.
The stand is built in to the tablet.
There are two legs that fold out to bring the tablet to an angle of 19 degrees.
There's a nice fabric pen holder in the top center.
You just slide your pen in and out of this.
As far as the screen temperature I didn't notice any warmth.
The edges and the back of the tablet are kind of an off-white color.
The Wacom One comes with a one year warranty and I'd say the build quality feels great.
The tablet does not flex much when you're bending it and the edges are smooth and rounded.
Overall I'd say the thickness is closer to the Intuos Pro or the Intuos 2019.
Now let's discuss compatibility.
And just for clarity, there is not a built-in computer in the Wacom One.
Now in order to connect the Wacom One to a compatible Android
device, you're going to need either
Wacom's adapter which is not included, or a USB-C mini hub.
Once you've connected the Wacom One to your Android device you can open the Samsung Desktop
It's not like the Intuos Android that I reviewed
This here is legit.
Now let's discuss installation and software.
Installation was very easy to set up.
All I needed to do was plug the tablet in and install the driver and it worked.
And there's lots of other options you can tinker with.
The Wacom One also comes with some bundled software. The software's only available for Windows 10.
There's Bamboo Paper which is a note taking app.
There's CLIP STUDIO PAINT PRO which offers you a free license for up to six months.
This is a great digital drawing and painting application.
You can also get Adobe Premiere Rush which is kind of a simplified video editing application.
This is very useful for doing video
editing on the go if you're doing vlogs and travel videos and things like that.
Adobe Fresco is coming soon.
They're offering six months license
but as of the making of this video it's not available quite yet.
So what can you do with the Wacom One?
You'll of course need two USB ports, one for data and one for power.
But it's neat to see that you can use this thing without having to plug it into a wall.
You can also use the Wacom One as a portable monitor through HDMI.
So for example
you might wanna use a monitor to monitor your video recordings or your photography.
So who is the Wacom One for?
who may also want to move their tablet between rooms or maybe even take it to school.
Android compatibility means the Wacom
One might even be a good tablet for photographers
who shoot on their phones to do some editing on the go.
Best of all Premiere Rush syncs with the desktop version through the cloud.
It also feels great for note taking.
And I have to say, handwriting on the Wacom
One felt really natural while using the Staedtler Pencil.
And now for some comparisons.
Should you get the Wacom One or the Cintiq 16 which is a bit more expensive?
And now for the price.
The Wacom One sells for $399.
You can purchase the Wacom One using the affiliate link in the description of this video.
So let's talk about some pros and cons.
The pros of the Wacom
One are that it's a very low-profile and lightweight device.
It comes with limited bundled software.
The Wacom One offers excellent pen quality
that's only exceeded by Wacom's Pro Pens.
The Wacom One supports other types of EMR
Pens which is great. And it supports some Android devices.
And now for the cons.
I was excited to try this at first, but my device is not supported so I can't.
The Wacom One does not have any express keys
Concerning the stand, 19 degrees is not the most comfortable angle to draw at.
And there's no way to adjust the angle to a more vertical orientation.
It could be dirt from your hand or it could be grime
that's on your desk.
And now for my conclusion.
I'm also happy to see
One is not a tablet computer.
If this was your first time on this channel, check out
some of my other drawing tablet reviews.
Thanks for watching and I'll see you next time.
so just how good is it
let's jump in and find out so just looking at this writing tablet
it is a super simple device
you have the main stylus here that used to actually write on the screen
obviously you have the large 8.5
inch screen up the front as well and LCD screen
it'll clear off and that seriously is all there is to it
I find that I generally try and use this
because you know you're saving the paper the pen as well is nothing fancy you can see
I find that I actually really enjoy sort of playing around and writing on this tablet
it's really smooth
it's really easy to write on
because of the technology they're using in the display
there is like no lag
you can see when I'm writing there's absolutely no lag just as soon as I'm pressing down
absolutely no lag which is pretty awesome and you can see all you need to do to clear it off
the screen is press that button
and you're back to the start know with all that said as much as I do love this
there are definitely a few drawbacks
that are you definitely want to know before you're picking this up so for one
I make a mistake
you can't rub it out or anything you do actually have to start again
which you know is a bit of a pain sometimes
it would be great if you could erase it and likewise you can
actually you know
you actually can't like you can't save the image or anything from the display
those are two pretty big drawbacks
the fact that you can't erase anything or you know
save what you've done without you know just taking a photo or something
don't necessarily want to get some paper or anything or you know sharpen my pencils or whatever
I'll give you a quick example
how about service bribe to China Tech
Oh like it comes out really well actually it takes
it's really accurate you know
there's no blockiness it's not
Peaks later or anything
I actually comes out really well
that's one of the reasons
I really enjoy riding on this display
and you know the pin just sort of flows over the display really easily
the riding experience itself is pretty incredible
like it's lag free like there's actually zero egg it just happens straightaway
the pin flows really nicely but as I was saying there are a few drawbacks
I really don't think you can go wrong
I find they super useful
maybe you'll find this useful as well really though that just wraps up this video
thank you for watching if you enjoyed
hey everyone welcome to another graphics tablet review today we are going to look at the
XP pan decals 0/3 wireless tablet
this is a review unit
that was sent to me from
XP pen so special thanks to them I can check this out
but before we look at the tablet in greater detail
let's take a look at the items that are included in the box
we have the warranty card
we have a thank-you card and some brochure warranty policy
this is the artists and T falling glove and this is the installation manual and Quick
Start card and this year this is a four gigabytes USB thumb
this cylindrical design is very simple
there are eight replacement tips included this ring here in the middle
that's the remover and this here
the stylus included is not powered by battery
so you do not need to charge it
the design feels quite solid
it has a large rubber grip here
two buttons on the side the overall feeling of holding it if use good it has a nice weight to it
it's towards the lighter side
buttons have a nice quicky
feel to them and tip here
it's quite firm
this pen supports slightly over 8,000 levels of pressure sensitivity
and this is that tablet
I like the design
the bit quality feels very solid matte surface texture is nice to touch and draw on
the corners are rounded off
they call this the basil which you can use to rest your hand on it at the top left here
we have this red color
scroll down and here
there are six physical shortcut buttons
I did not measure the battery life so I cannot tell you how long exactly the battery will last
the charging cable comes with two velcro straps
this is so much better compared to you know this black wire
this tablet does collect finger smudges a bit easily but I have to say that
it's the same for other brands of tablets as well on the back
we have four rubber feet and here
this is the on/off power switch for the tablet
you are not using the tablet you can choose to switch this off
this tablet has an auto slip function after 15 minutes of inactivity
let me just put a wireless receiver in
let me show you what you can do with the driver so you can change the pen pressure here
it uses a slider
you can assign specific
he was shot cuts to the two side buttons
and if you are left-handed you can change that here
this is where you can test a pen pressure
I have already assigned mine
but let me just show you what you can do
the function key is actually this
scroll down here and you can choose different functions
I have a really filter of the functions that I do not want
I want to use the scroll down to increase and decrease my brush size
I want to use it to zoom so these are the two functions that I want so I put a check in the check
box and click
OK and now when I press this shortcut button
can you see the more changes from brush size to zooming
let's test out the drawing functionality
this is Photoshop on the Mac
this is quite responsive
the pen is very sensitive
I mean zoom in
I can apply a very light pressure and get really thin lines like this
I can press down a bit harder to get thick lines like this
let me show you the transition between thin to thick the transition is quite smooth
let me show you how the lines how smooth the curve
so the curves here
they are really quite smooth
some other tablets may draw curves like this or circular objects
sometimes you can see angular strokes but here the curves they are very smooth
let me show you how
well the line is tapered
I think they'd hipper quite nicely
you have to install welcome in towards driver
I have already installed the driver from Wacom so pressure now works this is me bank paint
Pro pressure sensitivity works
really well right now
I'm using the scroll down to change the brush size
it's really easy to change the brush size
if you want to change the brush size very quickly the lines they taper here with me
Bank really nicely I think the lines they taper path her a nice little compared to photoshop
it does depend on the app that you use
the overall drawing experience is actually quite good
the lines come out just the way
I want them to be this is Krita on the map there is slight lag with Crete her
my thing is problem app and notice these angular lines when I'm trying to create smooth lines
these are the lines that I was talking about
it's quite impossible to draw smooth lines with
Krita for some reason it's not just with this particular tablet with other tablets
I also get this sort of performance and Krita really is a bit buggy on the Mac
this is a finicky designer on the
it's able to detect pressure as well the last app
I want to show you is higher
swiss caches
we see some marks here
I had a very satisfactory experience
drawing on this
it really feels nice to draw on such a large surface and the pen is very sensitive
I like the pen case
I like the overall build quality and the design
and the look so this is
the link will be in the video description below
and that's all for my review today
I hope this is helpful
thanks for watching
see you in the next video bye
with its Amazon fire HD 10 2019
the company released a new version of its popular 10 inch tablet after waiting for two years
that one was up to 2 gigahertz while Amazon is not telling us the processor brand
there's no IDE option right now
I got the one with 32 gigabyte and all of the box you can use 25.5 2 gigabyte for yourself
I'm also testing it
with the antutu benchmark but that's not supported here since the Samsung Galaxy Tab
a 10.1 is such an interest in competitor
I compared to that graphics performance and more detail in the Geekbench for compute and 3d
max slingshot extreme tests the Fire HD 10 scores quite a bit better than the Samsung tablet
I also edited some photos with Adobe Lightroom and that works as it should sure
it's not as snappy as a high-end tablet but that's to be expected of course usually
I also test multitasking
get closed fast on the background as they do on tablets was more
it can happen
that one is not supported
but that's very rare one game
I tried is a new
Call of Duty
I tried that one's great as well
however that's not my experience at all
I think the performance was pretty good
yes not great for multitasking
but the gaming performance is excellent for its price
glass shows a new
iPad is much faster but it costs twice
as much for $150
the performance is good
you can play most games
yes not with the highest graphics but at least they do run which is important at this price
the design of the Amazon Fire HD 10 did not change in the last two years
it has the same 10.1
inch screen and the black bezels
around it are quite big
it has a fully plastic body
I decided to get the blue one
its back fast
so if you don't want that
I suggest you get a case for it
a new feature is the USB C port that sits on one of the shorter sides
it's the first Amazon tablet with a USB C port
there's a micro
SD card slot
the cards can be up to 512 gigabyte in size on one of the longer sides
a tablet has two speakers
you can hear a real stereo separation which is great overall the sound quality is OK
sure not as good as tablets both for speakers but good enough for its price
it's certainly fine for watching
YouTube Netflix and Amazon video
both cameras have a resolution of 2 megapixels and both are capable of recording 720p videos
well as you can expect from 2 megapixel cameras the quality is bad
yes even for this price for video sheds its kind of acceptable but yes that's it
Amazon is shipping the Fire HD 10 was the same 10.1 inch IPS screens
I used for the 2017 version
it has an aspect ratio of 16 by 10 and the full HD resolution was 1920 by 1200 pixels
I always think that the resolution is fine on 10 inches
that's what many cheaper tablets are lacking
TM standards to support Netflix in HD
though so while the screen is not new
I think it continues to be fantastic in this price
range the Amazon Fire HD Tenace shipping with taya OS inversion 7.3
point one point one while it is an Android tablet Amazon is not mentioning Android anywhere
yes that's why apps like YouTube Gmail and the Google Play Store I'm missing
I didn't notice any big change compared to other recent fire tablets
you've got direct and fast access to all their services
we get eggs
Amazon photo apps own sake browser and a couple of standard ones like calendar
email app and the files manager integrated into file s is Alexa
I'm sure you're familiar with the voice assistant already the tablet supports Alexa
hands-free that means you can call her
even when the screen is turned off you can also activate the so called show mode once you do that
the tablet acts like an echo show and will display additional information
many of these ads are for books
but not all
you won't see add anywhere else so it's not too annoying well except you see
Amazon stuff everywhere
either and if you're looking for something in particular chances are you won't find it
well the Fire HD 10 is running Android
adjust does not always look like it
it might vote your volunteer though
I installed the Play
lets get to its battery life in my standard battery test
the tablet cutter one time of 20 hours for this
only but my wizard is theoretical
I recommend this tablet
that depends on what you're looking for
in fact it's the cheapest 10 inch tablet
I can recommend without having to stay tons of downsides the value is fantastic
it's not really worth it to upgrade
let's check out some alternatives
the most interesting competitor is the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 2019 it features a 10.1 inch full
HD screen too and the build quality is similar
the graphics
performance is not as good as on the fire but in real life differences are not that big for most
you're probably familiar with from your phone and you will likely get new
Android updates too
prices vary a lot by country but usually it costs below $200 if prices are similar
I'd personally go with the Samsung one
a cheaper alternative is the Amazon Fire HD 8
it's much smaller with its 8 inch screen and the performance is we got 2
I can recommend comfortably right now
alright the end of my Amazon Fire HD 10 2019 review
and we've really pretty much every tablet there you can always find mine and our recommendations
I'm Angie thanks for watching and see you next time
hey everyone in today's video
I'm going to review the VK 50 graphics tablet
this is a review unit
that was sent to me from gearbest.com
gearbest is a website that sells a lot of electronics
I have a really unboxed all the items so let me just show you
what are some of the things included so we have the foam pen case
this is not a half case but I think it protects the pen pretty well and this particular pen
it doesn't need batteries so you don't have to charge it
we'll look at that closer later on this is the USB cable for the tablet
so you do need to connect this tablet to your computer in order to use it
the driver supports both
Windows and Mac OS
we'll connect this later
there are eight replacement tips included and a nib remover
this is the Quick Start manual and there this thank you cut
that tells you where you can download the driver
there's no driver disk included so you have to download the driver from their website view
quality for this tablet is actually quite good
I like the design
looks very slick
I love the rounded corners here
I left a single sheet of material plastic
this is considered medium size and this is quite a good area to work with
it's very comfortable to work with
there are eight physical shortcut buttons
on this site
maybe laughing right
but that's basically what you get with this track
Patty County go up down left right
we have this nice pattern
can you see the pattern
is dot matrix pattern here
looks really cool
nice rubber feet that prevents the tablet from sliding around
this is a very thin tablet
looks really good for our us
$50.00 tablet this is the pen included supposed up to 8,000 levels of pressure sensitivity
it doesn't have a battery inside so you do not need to charge this pen
there are two side buttons construction the blue quality views very solid
it's more towards the lightweight side
which is something that I like
there's a little wobble to the pen tip
which is normal because all these are pressure-sensitive styluses for graphic tablets
they behave like that
and when drawing on the tablet surface it feels really nice
I've just connected that tablet to my computer
so this part here
this is al shape so when you connect this to the tablet the cable is going to go up
I'm right-handed I'm going to do this now
the hovering distance is about one centimeter which is very typical of such graphic tablets
and when the pen is near you see this light hat that comes on
when you're using the touchpad or the buttons here the light indicator will come on as well
Windows as well
so this is where you can customize the pen so for example if you want to customize the site button
there are several options that you can choose from
you can customize the clicks to different mouse clicks
you can assign specific keyboard shortcuts to those like buttons
there are other functions like accurate more
this will slow down the cursor as you're moving you can toggle between pen and razor
there are various monitors switch as well but
I'm not able to test that because I only have one monitor here
so here you can choose to map
and if you want to use the tablet as a mouse you can do so as well
there's the option here
let's take a look at the touch pad
so these are the options available
if you click on the drop-down menu again
these are the different functions
you can choose from
I have already customized directions to various shortcuts
more specifically for up and down
I have customized it to zoom in and zoom out for left and right
I have customized it to change the brush sizes
so yeah that's about it for the driver
all these features are will go on windows as well
alright let's test out the tablet and see how good it is at drawing
I'm going to open up a file that I have created on my tax review
these wages are testing out the different strokes
okay so these are the strokes
well see this giant cursor here
I'm going to use the trackpad to change the size of that person
the lines they are very smooth
so when you are drawing curves like this usually
but here you can see it tapers quite gradually so this is very good performance
let's take a look at other apps
so here's another cartoon character that
I drew so notice
the thin lines the thick lines clip studio works really well on this tablet
I can get in a thick lines very easily
let's take a look at
Krita same thing pressure works
it's not only two apps that has pressure sensitivity working
unfortunately for me
welcome bamboo paper and sketch of all those are apps
they don't have pressure
I'm not sure why that happens
I'm not sure why only MIDI Bank clip studio has pressure sensitivity
I'm using this on Mac OS and it works really well so for us $50
it's really worth the money as for
delete the wind tab drivers
that's all for my review today if you're also using this heaven
thanks for watching
see you guys in the next video bye
hello my name is Shannon Morris
I'm the producer of before you buy
I'm reviewing the Samsung ativ
tab 3 it cost 7 $29.99
it's a 10.1
inch tablet that runs full
Windows 8
so let's talk about the dimensions shall we
this is a 10.1 inch tablet
it's also 6.5 inches and it's very thin
it's less than an inch wide
oh it better be given
it's a tablet and it's also less than 2 pounds super super light and a very competitive product
I must say so this is a Samsung tablet
so it does include
where is it this little doohickey right here called an S Pen haha
very fun very useful and very nice
I like this thing
like a little click pad
that doesn't happen so well
so you have a little bit of memory quite a lot of storage 64 gigs
that's very good
there's integrated graphics and an Intel Atom CPU woohoo Intel Atom
so it's not an i3 like some of its competitors
unfortunately the speakers on this are pretty good for a tablet
there's dual speakers on both sides on this chrome finish on the siding
the two speakers are they can get very very loud however they are somewhat levels
there are also a front and a rear facing camera
the front camera is 720p and the rear facing camera is 2 megapixels
so you're going to get pretty decent
Skype calls but other than that
the display is 10.1 inches
it also gets very bright
I personally enjoyed using this display however the resolution is only 1366 by 768
that's rather low for the 10-inch competitive market at this moment
the ports on this are pretty nice
you get pretty much everything you could want
there's micro HDMI a micro USB
Windows 8 device out there probably the surface pro
that one runs around $900 on their website
so this is priced very well for that market
it also runs full
Windows 8 and it can be upgraded to 8.1
both of those have much better resolutions than this guy does
and it has an Intel Atom
you can find other
try or don't buy this item
it's very nice it's very fun
it's very easy to use especially if you just want to watch some
Sailor Moon on YouTube but otherwise would I spend 750 bucks yeah
I'm Shannon Morse and this was the Samsung ativ tab 3
hello internet world
welcome to a new video on the geeky noise channel in today's video
I've got something
I haven't reviewed for a long long
this is a very very affordable
Android tablet packed full of really good specifications and the value is fantastic
now they did send me this out free of charge
I haven't asked to see the video
I'll prove it beforehand so I'm going to share with you my honest opinion
it's a 10.1
inch android tablet with a full HD IPS display 3 gigabytes around 32 gigabytes of storage
Android version 9 so nice and up-to-date
so really good
it's a nice lightweight design as well lightweight sort of metal design
it's got an octa-core processor
in here with a frequency up to 1.6 gigahertz so a nice specification overall
this is what the screen looks like
it does have the Google suite of apps pre-installed
it also supports the
that would be strange watching that
but that's lost so
let's just check that it's running a nice
oh that's an old one
that's not even available in HD let's pop an HD video up
let's get rid of that one
let's put a new newer video on here
we go this is one
I did just recently
they're very very clear
let's pop the speakers on as well so you can hear how the speakers sound so as you can hear there
the speakers are nice and clear
we've also got some photos
I took earlier now just to let you know with regards to the cameras
I'm pretty sure the front-facing camera is I think it's 9 megapixels
and the rear facing camera is 13 megapixels so a good resolution on the cameras
Oh 8 megapixels
let's take a look and see what they look like so we pop into gallery
where's McHenry gone
it's weird sometimes
I just can't find it so let's actually go into this through
oh here we go of course so here we go
here's some photos that I took using the Google Photos app
and here's one of they get all my life nice detail
this was in less than optimal lighting
this was very very dark lighting
it still managed to capture a nice amount of detail so very pleased with that
let's go across to this one again
the camera does perform extremely well very very good camera performance
you can also capture video as well and you must remember that
the cameras on a tablet is not often the strong point
let's pop into Google Chrome
I left a link to the van
and then if we look across the top here we've got a couple of sort of microphone
pickups we've got the power on/off button we've got the volume rocker
we've got a couple of speakers and round on this side
it's completely blank
and this is
IPS display
I think makes this a little bit better value so I'm really very very impressed with it
so that's the closer look at the tablet before
I give you my final opinion on this and another little look
let's take a look inside the live chat we've got Alex Anderson in the live chat
good morning to you
Alex thanks for tuning in live
also sea winds mister vlogger
Andrew Williams as well
I could see an elderly person using this for simple usage
that's just staying in touch with family or watching on demand or on the go very very true
excuse my studio light sort of catching the screen on this
but this is what the tablet looks like again
it's a very robust tablet
nice and lightweight
it's got some metal construction in here as well
this is what the back looks like
very very nice tablet nice and slim line nice and portable and just really well designed
I certainly can recommend it at this price point
I think it represents good value for money and it's well worth considering
there are a lot of options out there when it comes to more affordable tablets and
I've been really pleased with how this is performed
do bear in mind
I think is admirable for the price
do check out the links down in the video description area
I want to thank you all for watching
I really do appreciate it
I'll see you in another video very very soon
hey everybody ultimate vision
welcome back for another video so today
I'm bringing you guys the review of the to ivx 3 7 inch android 4.2 tablet
let's jump right in alright guys
so here
we have the chewy vx3 7 inch android tablet
now we're gonna take a brief look at the design so particularly at the back
so if you want to expand your memory from the 16 gigabytes that's already built in
you could just put your memory card in and there you have it
you have extra memory now if you take a look at the front panel
I will talk about the display
but we're just gonna take a brief look at the front panel
you'll find the three capacitive buttons at the bottom
that's the return the home button and the tabs button
so you know this will obviously allow you to use those functions
and then if we take a look at the top
which also allows you to make phone calls hence the use of the two
3G SIM cards
which you can per the back
we have the universal charging port
that's pretty much all you get
on the tablet there are no any other physical buttons no buttons on the display
it says volume plus and volume minus and
I really don't think it takes a genius to know that the two buttons like on the same hinge
so they're right next to each other means volume up and volume down
every phone has the volume up and volume down rocker
they put the power button logo which
the microphone has to be there or somewhere in this region
I've you know I found really pointless now
I also forgot to mention
this tablet costs one hundred and ninety six dollars and I just wanna you know
put that out there for you guys to consider throughout this entire review
China branded products
always have that stereotype to be not as good as your typical
Samsung Sony HTC Apple
and a lot of the time they are you know
I'm not gonna lie
I've bought a few tablets in the past from China and they've been absolutely rubbish
they've had the worst displays the worst cameras the worst design and built quality
but this feels really really nice
just feels really great for this tablet
the egg megapixel camera takes some really really great photos as you guys can see now
this device features an mtk6592 processor
it performs really really good with the intense apps such as Real Racing 3 which requires a lot
surprisingly they also be running on 2 gigabytes of RAM
they're offering me to review this tablet and at first
it cost 196 dollars and it performs like an absolute beast
you wouldn't really expect it from you know
obviously the brand it's chewy or chewy
I don't even know how you pronounce it
well if you're going to compare this tablet with for example
Samsung's Galaxy Tab 7
you know sorry
Samsung but you know this tablet really does win
VX 3 7 inch android 4.4.2 tablet
i will totally advise you guys to go ahead
and check out the link in the description to the tablet
i would totally recommend this tablet
have a great day guys peace
I have no financial relationship with the company
they're not paying for this review
this is one point
I really like just how powerful the magnet is on the latching mechanism here
it's very satisfying
it's a very fast process here
when you get everything reattached
you do get a little bit of image bleeding
so that's what you got in there
Core M processor
kickstand so on the surface
you'll remember that that one kind of sits like that
this one sits more flat
that back kickstand here has a lot more surface area
it really does lay flat
it's very positionable so you have a lot of different ways
nice design in here
they even tucked away a micro SD card slot in the back
there - if you want to augment some of its onboard storage there
the keyboard is also very nice
this is a ThinkPad keyboard
through-and-through same size
although for some reason it just stopped working
you're also reattach it and get it to go again
there is a backlight on here
I was expecting a louder
sound out of this
but it does sound okay
it's not too tinny and there is good stereo separation
DisplayPort over here for plugging in external displays
they do have some other docks that they're going to come out with
I don't have any of those to look at today but those will be coming out very shortly
there's a headphone microphone
adapter here volume rocker up and down and a Kensington
lock as well
your power switch is up here
on the top
you know this is the problem when you get into this
that will add some some bulk but also some weight to the package
they do have a little loop on the keyboard
USB port as a pen holder
if you want over here you can see when
I get the pen
closer to the screen that it's detecting its presence
and there's a cursor moving around very similar to what we've seen on the surface
I does have a gorilla glass screen so you should be ok with pushing down a little bit hard on it
what's nice too is it does have good risk detection
also so it's not picking up my wrists as I'm writing here
I think to the Microsoft Surface pen all right so let's take a look at some web browsing first
we've got that
AC Wireless built in
so you'll have some decent wireless capabilities here and it actually looks really nice
I don't see any drop frames
it really did very well on that as well and again
I'm really quite pleased with the quality of the display
here too now
I'll take some images and move them around here and resize them as you can see
everything is responding very quickly to what
I'm doing here
that are not going to tax
a graphical processor too heavily
this is going to do quite nicely here
and on the 3dmark cloud gate test which measures how well it might do
on some of those triple-a titles we got a score of three thousand five hundred and twelve
let's take a look at some movie watching all right so
I've got a blu-ray MKV
playing here right now
I can skip ahead to different portions of the movie here no issues
this is a really nice little tablet device
I haven't been a big fan of this form factor
this is the one
this is lines
i've been thanks for watching
this channel is brought to you by my patreon supporters including gold-level supporters
this is a video review of the visual land prestige elite 10 QL Android tablet
it's a 10-inch
Android tablet with a quad core processor
it comes with a removable keyboard case
and stand as you can see here some other specs on this
here's tablet itself
looks like it has a screen protector on it right now
you can see this little film right here so probably eventually remove that
it's got a a nice rubberized backing here that has some texture to it and so we look in here
we have is the case which has a leather look and feel to it magnetic clasp
and here's the keyboard also comes with a stylus okay
we also have a wall adapter and a micro
it's been working great for me what
I wanted to look at right now
is the ports on the side
so let's take a look here so we've got microphone
headphone jack and here
we have two micro
it's one of the latest versions of the software
ok and let's go ahead and take a look at videos on this device
coming out soon so go ahead and play this projects so side
viewing angles on this device are pretty good
the only thing is the top and bottom viewing angles especially the top
aren't that good but overall the screen is pretty sharp as you can hopefully see so
hopefully that gave you a good idea of
how videos would play on this tablet now
and it's pretty responsive
graphics were pretty smooth which is nice
so that's just roughly
how games work on this tablet
you can take it places
so it's pretty portable
and now there is a kickstand at the back here
there's a little tab right here and you can put it out like that now
this keyboard here is magnetically attached to the bottom
here it's removable
so we put this kickstand out and the keyboard connects through this microUSB cable
right here
Docs is on here so I wanted to go ahead and show just how it would be to type up documents on here
the keyboard is pretty good its full size it rides nice feedback and so if I type here
I'm testing how to testing out
the document feature on this tablet keyboard works pretty well
so it's decently accurate
I made a few errors
but it's also because of the angle
I'm at when I'm recording this this video
I do find the keyword pretty easy to use
I've typed up a few documents on here
no problem and it's nice that it connects through this
this cable right here so it's it's instantaneous
the the connection
it's been a pleasure to use and I definitely recommend it
thanks for watching
what's happening everyone
my name is Alex and welcome back to a new review for today
around 9,000 milliamp battery
this is the jumper easy pad
six pro tablet that runs
Windows 10 and cost somewhere around two hundred dollars
so what do we get for that money
well first of all we get an IPS screen with 1080p resolution
we get the Intel and 3450 CPU
this is a quad-core CPU
so the tablet decides we have some advantages and some disadvantages
I mean it's awesome to watch a movie on this
you don't really want it all scratched up now on the left hand side
um than a tablet one thing
I don't really like about
Bluetooth Aniki and um listen that way
it's better than I was expecting so you can actually see the screen
once again
mostly whenever you're doing those benchmark tests as for the internal storage out of that 64 gigs
that comes with this device
this is somewhat slower
and you're mostly gonna notice that when you're opening new app so if you open
it's 1080p and at that resolution
they do work very very well
you can also play games on this tablet and the tablet has a built-in accelerometer
I played the asphalt 8 and as you can probably see does work
it's definitely gonna be awesome to watch movies on it now
this is the same file -
the battery life is not bad for me personally
I had to charge it every second day
but it really depends how you use your tablet how you keep your screens brightness
we have insight and it's time to conclude this video so first things first
I love the screen
I love how big it is
I'm imagining that
that's um why it slows down because it gets hot so for 200 bucks
I think it's worth it but if you have more money you can get something better
definitely go for it alright
guys hopefully enjoyed this video if you did like it press that like button
don't forget subscribe and I'll see in the next one
thanks for watching
what's happening everyone
my name is Alex and welcome back to a new review today
we are checking out one of the most affordable 10 inchess tablets
outers so this one
so just over 720p
the colors look good
the viewing angles are good
of course the maximum resolution that you can select it's 720p but at 720p
I was quite surprised to see that
at all now you're gonna have to use a full sized umm sync or something that
I haven't seen in a while and next those two SIM card slots the tablet can also take an SD card
then you can actually install apps on that SD card
and that's good because the tablet only comes with 16 gigs of internal storage
they don't sound that great
not to mention that you can actually make phone calls so this tablet
but then you'd have the speakers on the back so making phone calls to this
tablet is probably not ideal
the screen gets crashes very very easy so if you use anything else but your finger
the battery life on it
isn't that amazing
then it takes a few seconds to load the page and so on so everything is done in slow motion
it's a bit challenging to you
so keep that in mind
inches screen but the tablet is very slow
the battery life isn't great
great at 720p so me personally
great alright guys hopefully enjoyed this video if you did like it press that like button
don't forget subscribe and I'll see in the next one
thanks for watching
My goal today is to get the shady dealings I’ve experienced out in the open
I should mention overall
That naive person won’t be you, not once you’ve heard this.
So let’s start with the truth for tablet buyers.
You need to review tablets from different companies to know which ones are good.
Be wary of how tablet companies use popular artists to try and sell you stuff.
Tablet companies target well-known artists,
send them an inexpensive tablet to “review” or “unbox”
so all of their fans learn that company exists and maybe end up buying something.
And if you don’t do what they say?
Well, they stop sending you stuff.
I’ve had two different companies go so far as to request
At the time it didn’t seem so crazy but now that I’m talking about it - wow. That’s devious!
So be careful where you get your tablet reviews.
Don’t buy something just because your favorite artist did a video about it.
Now for the juicy details - let’s discuss what kinds of things I’ve been asked to do.
As a basis
for comparison, a decent tablet company will send you the product for free.
The only thing they ask in return is a review and links to the product’s store page.
That’s it.
Some demand video descriptions
be a certain way.
They usually have a long, typed up description for you to copy and paste.
This includes their social media, sale prices, information about products
you didn’t even talk about in your review, etcetera.
And they police this.
I’ve rewritten descriptions to be more clear, and was asked to change them back.
Some companies will ask you to send them the review video before you post it online.
When this happens you’ll end up with a customs and import bill.
I’ve tried to get companies to pay this.
Sometimes they do, sometimes they don’t.
Sometimes you’ll be offered a chance to do a giveaway.
email lists and social media.
It’s also very easy to cheat in these contests.
One contest required winners outside of certain countries to pay for shipping.
That’s actually illegal
in many places; giveaways must be free to enter and free to win.
Giveaways are worse than reviews.
The company is using you to profit.
Reviewing, sure, but little did I know that
Repeat this process until everything works.
This is product testing.
Product testing is a paid job.
I got absolutely nothing out of doing this.
Never agree to test tablets.
You should be receiving the finished product ready for review.
The most recent development is review deadlines getting ridiculously tight.
Normally a company either mentions no deadline, or around 3 weeks.
So, what to do about all this?
Any of the stuff I’ve mentioned you can negotiate.
Say no, or even simply ignore unreasonable requests.
How are they going to know if you left a five star review on Amazon or not?
They don’t.
Give the product the rating it deserves.
You have the power here.
It’s your channel and you are an independent reviewer, not their sales department.
Please share this with other artists
you know so they don’t fall into the same traps
I did.
As of now I am quitting tablet
I wish to stay focused on animation and animation tutorials.
My experience 100% mirrors these guys, and they do way more tech reviews.
Links below to their perspective on the Painful Truth About Drawing Tablet Reviews.
hello everybody Marco Chiappetta for hot Hardware here
she is right in front of you
that is a white 16 gig
the note is on display
here there's a simple literature pack
that's included with the unit
let me get some specifications out of the way first
the note 10-1 is powered by a samsung exynos
4 quad core
update is coming
we're just not sure quite when but it is in the works
touch responsiveness is very good
images look great
so let's take a look at some of the design elements on the Galaxy
Note 10 one a couple of the first things
you're likely to notice
are these front mounted speaker grilles here
Samsung went ahead and moved the speakers to the front of the note
10-1 as opposed to the size or the back on many other tablets now
this setup allows the audio to be basically blasted towards your ears
so you do end up with a better audio experience on the note 10-1 and any other tablets
this raised edge where the metal meets the glass
what you see on the front here is also a 1.9 megapixel front facing camera on the sides
there's really nothing to talk about
they're perfectly smooth on the bottom
we have the dock connector and a microphone and on the top
we have the power button volume rocker a micro SD card slot nice and easily accessible card slot
that's a great move and the IR emitter and a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
there are a couple things to see on the back of the Galaxy
here is the s-pen slot
the s-pen is the stylus included with the Galaxy
Note 10 one
when you slide that stylus out of its slot
some stylus optimized apps become available
TouchWiz is fairly clean
lots of people prefer the stock
Android experience TouchWiz
I actually kind of like it
these are the stock home screens
you can see there's plenty of widgets already loaded up but the device is very responsive
now here
you see the stock
Android browser as you can see
the scrolling is great zooming is responsive works really well but multi-screen is some that
Samsung is touting with the Galaxy
you'll actually be able to have two apps running side by side so here you see the browser
here's s note on this side
now we should point out although you're seeing both apps they're not exactly both running here so
I mean s note if I come back to the browser did you see that lag
let me go back to s note
I try to scroll here
nothing happens for a couple of seconds so while the app is technically still running
it is in an inactive state
so it's really just for viewing windows side by side now
we should also point out that multi-screen only works with a core group of apps
the browser works
Polaris Office s
let's let's pop that guy up here so this is something unique to Samsung
now you have a relatively small screen but as you see
I have four things open at once
previously tablets were really just about consumption
Samsung wants to change that
so the next thing we want to show you in action is the s-pen let me slide it from its slot
you can use it to navigate the device just as you would your finger
you just have more precision
let me bring up s note and show you what
I'm talking about now forgive me if I bump the camera and make it move
if you're doing multi-screen you just have more control with the s-pen it's not a game changer
Samsung's parts part of the reason
the galaxy note was so popular and they brought the technology to the tablet
we hope you like this
quick look at the samsung galaxy
numbers come by the site
check out the full review once again this is Marco Chiappetta for a hot hardware
I want to thank you for stopping by
titles if you're not an Xbox owner you prefer PC gaming
also the full
textured rubber grips provide a high comfort for those long gaming sessions so thanks to
Windows 10 your Lynx vision
Windows 10 PC experience ensure maximum productivity between gaming sessions
so let's take a look at the system itself for some reason
Microsoft chose not to sell the system in the United States
the only sellers are in the UK and they will not allow shipping to the United States
the system comes complete with a gaming cradle
so you don't need to worry about picking up any type of an adapter for the tablets
microUSB port so you can connect your Xbox controller
you can do that if you want to
but what's the point
the tablet itself has a very good weight to it
it's solidly built has a great finish to both the casing and the glass
the tablet synced perfectly to my Microsoft account my gmail my xbox
I've used several tablets in the past
it's great now
the color is okay
it's great for sitting on the couch or in bed or out by the pool
it's certainly nowhere
it looks really good on
my friend said that they can hear themselves when they spoke
now the cradle fits neatly around the tablet
you can lock the tablet in place
two handles one on the left
which is there your left stick left trigger bumper and the d-pad on the right
you have your right stick right trigger bumper and the ax
B Y buttons that are lit up the cradle is comfortable to hold and hand grips feel really good
it's very similar to the
Xbox elite rubberized grips now
I wish the grips were adjustable as far as the angle
just doesn't feel quite right
you're reaching for the bumper trigger while you're using the sticks or pressing the face buttons
I put this down to muscle memory
you can do that sitting on the couch
this is a great solution
what mess with my muscle memory is the positioning of the left and right stick
I'm used to these sticks being really close together and just by moving them apart
it kind of throws you off a little bit at first
I do like the controller cradle
it works very well
I did find that every so often
that's small enough to throw in a backpack or small bag
I've been mainly opted to use the tablet or in tablet mode
I don't rarely use the PC mode only when I needed to dig
the battery lasts very well
and you know if you're starting to shop for a Windows 10 tablet
it's great you know what more could you really ask for so
so if you're looking for one good luck
I do recommend eBay for trying to search for one
great tablet though
hey what's up guys this is
Steven from Tech Steve HD comm making technology easier in this video
I have the Zen pad 8 version 3 atm so sit back
let's take a closer look at the tablet itself on top of the tablet
you'll find a 2 megapixel camera and the cool thing about this
particular camera is that it can do a hundred and 40 degree panoramic view with the software
this tablet also supports
this tablet is also available in five different colors
you have dark grey pearl white rose gold mint green and you also have orange
it has plenty of power
it has 21.3
but the great thing is soon as you connect it to Wi-Fi there's a free upgrade to version 7.0
now and I showed you a little bit about the tablet
let's go and set it up
you're going to have to have a gmail account installed from this screen you can choose
then hit next
I'll choose a pattern
once you select that hit continue and then confirm it and this is where you can redeem your
Google's Drive offer all you do is press redeem go to your email account and accept it now
your setup is complete and then press ok now you know how to set it up
you can do your gallery
I'm gonna choose downloads and choose a blank app and so blue
and there's the main screen to put icons back on your screen
you can drop and drag them and you also can put widgets
let me show you how to do that
from the three lines
find the application that you use the most
so let's say for example
let go and there's a clock to get rid of it hold it drag it over
you could have the display to automatically adjust itself or as the brightness
your notification change sounds
do not disturb your built in memory
I just want to show you guys just to outline in the software but there's so many features in it
I can make a two hour video based off of that
okay now let's take a listen to the built-in speaker and I'm gonna try some headphones on
okay that's that max volume
you actually can make your own videos built into the software
I'm not gonna go through the whole process but I'll show you what the app looks like
I'm going to show you a couple samples of the photos
taken on this tablet overall
this is a pretty good tablet
subscribe to my channel and I'll send the next one peace
this is Lisa from mobile tech review
and this is the Acer Iconia a 500 10.1 inch Android tablet
point of 449
don't try it also
we'll take a look around the device and see back here
this rather large plastic door pulls up a little fiddly killer with that little plastic legs on it
we've taken the plastic off the SIM card slot over here
and golly gee they beat motorola on this the micro
SD card slot actually works
we're still waiting for a software update for the Motorola Xoom to add the SD card slot
it's nice to looming them back
it looks like a fairly quality piece
we've got some plastic on the edges
pikas the antennas running under the edges stereo speaker
grates right here
but we assume there's a dock connector on the bottom for potential accessories
you can see
it's a pretty slim unit to the case is also not quite together over
Jack your power button
so it's a nice looking tablet
it certainly doesn't look cheap or cheesy or anything like that
it's definitely one step up more than one
step up from some of the super budget ones
we see a places like fries there the COBE tablet and even nicer than the viewsonic
we'll compare them in a minute
terms of sharpness and color saturation is good
this is at maximum brightness
right now if you're in a bright room
I would like it to go a little higher than it does other than that there
so nothing wrong with the display it's running Android 3.0 one honeycomb operating system
that's designed for tablets has a one gig of ram a dual core
Tegra 2 CPU standard stuff right there
Wi-Fi 807 BG and a single band
inch displays
you can see that the Acer is a bit wider it has larger bezels on it
it costs a lot of money
a miniaturised things so one of the ways that Acer probably was able to make this more
does that beveled edge kind of thing there that makes it look a lot slimmer
well if we look from that side where the Motorola does have bells then the Acer
there's a side view
it's about 1 pound 12 ounces
it's almost 1.7 pounds
but it feels like actually feels lighter than Motorola Xoom
you get a lot less
so you've got that dual core
it gets 41 on
Linpack as well and here we've got pretty much
your basic vanilla honey come so far not releasing any heavy customizations of honeycomb
I think Google doesn't really want it
I app which is a streaming multimedia hub
we'll talk about later
let's see what talking about right here
we'll take a look at that right now
we're in the bookstore view
there's no bookstore available in this region and the current bookstore
region selection is looks like twice now obviously as Germany and is that is China
oh well you download something from feed books in fact
let's go do that
it's a web browser
well grab a copy of one write night and no registration or anything
requirement feed books
so you can just in one doesn't finish downloading it so
I'll go back to our book shop and see if it's there and indeed there it is
we've got cute
page turn animations probably
you're not going to want to read like this
probably you'd prefer to read in portrait mode
that's a much better presentation
it's pretty giant
so we're going to drop that down and it handles that just fine
you can put bookmarks on here
you can go to the table of contents for example they also go your bookmarks
there's a night mode over here and that's pretty much it for features in this reader
now you can side load books into Lumiere II but what you need to do first and sit down
download something from one of those free sources like feed books so it creates a
that's on the internal storage area
I should mention that with Android
but that gives you the ability then to transfer files no problem okay
I've got Google books over here
that's pretty much a known quantity we've seen on other android tablets pretty presentation
we've got a couple of books here and this gives you a little bit more about flashy looking layout
you can have your dual facing pages over here
you can change your font size
you can do that in fact
the market has searched for both applications and books on honeycomb tablets
take a look at multimedia
we've got photo browser
they've got their own photo browser on here we've got
it's a streaming media player for streaming it
say inside your house
you control is slightly complicated
you can see it has a little indicator up there that tells me
I supposed to put two fingers on the screen
it looks like you poked
of course you can just use it normally
but they're saying if you do that you can just turn your pages like so okay
it's cute
let's check out an email player
let's check out videos and it shows you movies
now there's possible other application with just a front end to gallery anyway
you might say one or two frames drop here and there
but it's actually a fully animated video chalk up under the zoom here
well let locally start
1080p video
didn't go too well
so let's just take a look at the honeycomb
YouTube player which has of course a beautiful glorious wall of monitors metaphor here
they were all try playing something off of YouTube
really lovely interface here
Wi-Fi since this isn't a free Jean you know to have an N connection
it's doing better here
it will visit our own website and this is the standard on-screen keyboard
you can see here
it comes with honeycomb
the performance is very good on the dual core
Tegra processors but the controls don't exactly work real well yet
2 obviously you get to play real flash on this which is nice and also the
the browser is excellent
if you've got a tab browser you can switch between the tabs quite easily performance is very good
it's a very desktop like experience
they're gonna take a look at gaming
it's a hack and slash game starting off with the cutscene here
it's not the highest quality cutscene everything
but how much does that matter
it doesn't the game
very nice now
that's sealed inside
it's still doing that
now this is the tech class m89 tablet a hundred and fifty bucks
it's metal you have the teclast logo the m89 logo and pretty much a couple of indicators
what the site things are you know you have your buttons
you have her camera
you have a mini
HDMI you have your headphone jack micro SD card and finally a USB C port
someone back here you have your teclast logo your m89 logo and here on the side
you have your little little indicators
what the things are you have your power buttons your volume your camera your mini
HDMI USB C microphone headphone
oh sorry not microphone
headphone jack and a micro SD card slot as you can see it
picks up fingerprints pretty easily
let's look at the bezels
bezels are fairly big
they're not too small
you can see that the top and bottom bezels
I mean they're fine
LeBron James and on the sides here you have decent metals with bezels
that you can hold on to also as you can see
there's really not much to complain about the book quality
m89 definitely has a decent screen
it's not the best again
I know I say that a lot but really in these cheap tablets really get
that's decent screens
you get screens
you might actually be concerned or you might
actually you know notice a difference and care about it which is very important but for me
I use LCDs most of my life
I don't really use AMOLED display phones so most of the LCDs you know
most of them are better
but they're not that much better and in this display that
Tecla 79 does a pretty good job and I like it quite a bit
it's actually very good for reading comics as well
I read quite a lot of comics a lot of Marvel Comics in
it looks very very good and 4x3 is perfect for reading comics
I mean I think
16 by 9 16 by 10 is a little bit narrow for reading comics
4 by 3 is what you want to get
which would be this tablet right here
there is a feature in this which is called night mode which pretty much yellows the screen so
I'm gonna show you what it looks like so as you can see
the screen has noticeably yellowed
and this actually does help
there is actually not a lot of bass in this tablet and it's fairly noticeable
even if you play something with bass or you're watching stuff with explosions it sounds tinny
I don't really see that very often in tablets and even if I did
there's one more thing
let me type a little bit for you here that that's really strange and I'm not sure was going on
it's annoying but it's not deal breaking
let's put it that way so let's listen to the audio and see what we got
oh and before that the audio volume is super loud
so there's really nothing to worry about there all right
so there's that as you can see
stand my battery life
though is very good the standby battery life was something of quite a wonder as you can see
I left it for
I think six days and it dropped maybe like thirty percent which is very very good
very impressed with the standby battery life
as you can see here
I don't really care that much
it works well
there's really not much to say about that and I am perfectly happy with Android 7.0
as long as it's optimized well so I think is very smooth
there's really no problem with it
it's definitely a lot smoother than the chewy high nine that one was not very well optimized
this is very well optimized
it's pretty much as whoops
it's pretty much as smooth if not smoother than a shammy me pad three
I think this one actually beats the meat pad three slightly in terms of smoothness
I'm gonna clear all so I can show you what I'm talking about
you have three gigabytes of RAM and the 30 gigabytes of RAM is sufficient
but sometimes it's not enough so as you can see opening
Chrome was super fast
you know it opens pretty much instantly the open on Google Play Store
that's also instant
there are times that multitasking
does you know it starts lagging and slowing down and closing apps on you
most of the time
it's fine but if you start opening too many apps you start seeing the problem and here
so lastly will open manga a on and this one takes a little bit longer
it's I think it's filling up the RAM a little bit
so there's that to be concerned about now moving on to gaming
I was not able to play asphalt extreme every time I tried playing asphalt
extremely would tell me that this thing kept on crashing which is very strange
I'm not sure what's going on
I think there just might not be enough
so there's that's not good
the performance is not bad
this is a pretty light game though
so there's that this is a pretty fun game actually so it's not bad and as you can see
there was a little pop up there that was just to show you that
asphalt has crashed which is annoying
so there's yeah that's that's something that I I'm very surprised
I don't think ashwaldt has ever crashed really that much
I don't know why it crashes
nothing has complained about there so in conclusion the teclast m89 is a very very good tablet
I am impressed with it
I think sometimes it goes actually higher
maybe 190 at certain stories at that price
I really wouldn't recommend it
well on today's episode
we're going to be taking a look at the connect X 10.1 inch quad-core calling tablet
hey guys what's going on
my name is Christian and welcome to another video
that's the name and it doesn't sound very interesting
I must say the template for sale on tequila
Noga it has 3G calling tablet capabilities
it has 16 gigs of memory
whatever the heck that supposed to be so out the box what do we get first thing is enough
it's process er it comes with two gigs of ddr3
RAM it's 10.1
inch display has 10-point touch and a display resolution of 1 to 800 by 800
it has a whopping six thousand milliamp hour battery
it has dual sim capabilities
it has GPS Bluetooth version 4 and Wi-Fi 802 PGN
it has a 3.5
mm stereo jack
it has a built-in microphone as well as dual speaker capabilities and in Wales 560 grams
that's more than half a kilo
so let's start with the pros with its five thousand milliamp hour battery
I shouldn't have to note
it actually kept up with me so some of the cons so the the biggest con corner
I have noticed
what more could you need with a battery this size
this is suitable for work and play even watching a movie on
this would be quite good
the only problem though is that you wouldn't have to mind carrying around
there's a link to my review of that up there in the YouTube cards
and if you do know anyone would be willing to loan us
the device for review or possibly sponsor an episode of texans array
I'll be in the comments chatting to you and letting me you know what I think of your video ideas
thanks for watching
I'll see you same time
same place next week
hello shoppers for today's video
we will be reviewing the tech class p20 hd 10 inch tablet from lazada
it comes with a standard box packaging opening it up
the first thing you will see is a tablet wrapped in protective plastic
taking it out of the box we can see that it already has a pre-installed screen protector
the tablet itself a type c cord a sim injector an adapter
the warranty card and the manual seen on top of the tablet is an earphone
jack and a sim tray
the right side doesn't offer anything
it is just a smooth and blank
surface at the bottom of the tablet is where you see the two speakers at the left side
you may insert a sim card and an sd card to expand
its storage or use it as a cell phone after setting up the tablet
we can see that
it doesn't include that much bloatware or pre-installed
apps to test the tablet
i also installed some apps that i usually use
but if you want to include a case it is worth 6499 pesos
in here i will be testing
the video and sound quality by playing
was netflix
your goal to destroy it
p20 hd includes a 2 megapixel front camera and a 5 megapixel back camera
the front camera is decent enough to use for online class
the tablet could handle the software or the internet was too slow
your team destroyed the turret victory in terms of drawing on this tablet
i can't recommend it
it doesn't produce smooth lines
i've tried using my finger and two styluses but the lines remained uneven to test it out further
the tablet has no problem drawing straight lines
it does however go uneven when drawing curved lines
this gives you a way to customize your phone system
it's just like an easter egg
that is all i have to review and i hope you found this video informative
thank you for watching
some of these aren't yet done
this is when i already applied the precise flick that is why its much smoother to draw
then let's go here in
then you will see the shortcut of the graphic tablet in your desktop
i just carelessly put it down
it is exactly 20 nibs as i counted
it won't focus lmao in pink color TADAAAA!
anddd there's a black box
let's open it soooo here
it is lmao maybe even if i throw it away
the tablet won't be damaged
the bag is thick with many pockets
this is supposed to be unboxing but i got excited
i bought it for
P1,055/21.11 usd free shipping
i bought it on sale in
Lazada for today's video
i'm going to review
and your authority
what's going on my name is
Kevin the tech ninja and today
we are reviewing another Lenovo product
this is the yoga 2 tablet now
I know before you guys go ahead and scream and rage quit and leave comments down below
this is a different version of it this is
Lenovo yoga tablet 2 8 inch
it has the exact same specs but the performance is different
why is that well
let's find out just like it's tennis brother
the yoga 2 8 inch is a sleek tablet
mostly silver in color with a variety of design materials
you go from a smooth kickstand to a gritty back and then back to a smooth bezel
it would be hard to find a person to say
the front-facing camera is on the side
bezel at the bottom or side depending on your orientation
the front facing large chamber studio speakers are visible following the curve around
we will see the front of the stand to access the stand
I use my thumb to slide the stand out
The Stand sports for different angles or as Lenovo calls them
modes these modes are called stand
hold tilt and hang on the right
the top is completely bare and the opposite side
bezel is the headphone jack right now
I'm going to say a statement that you will hear several times throughout this review
just like the 10-inch yoga
2 these two devices are the same under the hood the 8 inch IPS
LCD display is full 1080p resolution
the pixel density is 283 which gives it text that pops off the screen
this includes images to the color reduplication and saturation looks great
the high shine and the shadows gives you a sense of depth
the blacks are also rich in color
IPS LCD s in general
the chassis is built from plastic now
I can't say that it will bend or not but I'll let you be the judge of it
the yoga 2 8 inch makes me scratch my head
since it's the same device as the 10-inch one would assume that it runs the exact same way
I won't say it runs as smooth as a nexus 7
but it's still pretty good
this device absolutely flies when gaming
that's when the yoga flexes its muscle as expected all games ran smooth from dead trigger to
the yoga comes out of the box with
Android 4.4.2 kitkat
it's also running lenovo's own
UI skin on top of Android
some would say is very iOS like and I would mostly agree
there isn't an app drawer and the quick settings are located at the bottom via a menu
Lenovo calls bottom switch
Lenovo package is a good amount of applications on the device
most of the applications they supply are applications that would either have came with stock
Android or there's a better alternative in the Play Store
one application that sticks out for the bunch is security
most of the applications are forgettable and quickly become background annoyances
the camera is a yoga tablet
are okay at best
you need to adjust your hand
your hand naturally rests over the camera
once you take only a few shots you can quickly see what the camera has to offer
images let color grain is evident even in decent lighting and the shutter is pretty slow
if you rapidly tap the shutter button
the camera cannot keep up even in good lighting using studio lighting
I was able to get better shots but that was after adjusting a lot of settings prior to the shot
these settings need to become your best friend for video the camera is able to shoot at full
HD 1080p and the issues I had with the pictures translate to the video mode
the microphone is decent and it picks up your voice pretty well and that's about it now
a tablet is their number one device
and it's something
you really can't go wrong
lenovo has made a lot of strides with this tablet versus the 10 inch
Edition not sure if it's software or what it is but it actually is a decent tablet that
I don't mind picking up and using as always guys my name is Kevin the tech ninja
make sure you check out the written companion piece down below
make sure you like this video
Android take care
welcome to a video from the juice lifestyle calm and in this video
we're gonna have a look at the exit icon
Leah 770 Android tablet difficult to stand out in the neck in a Android Market
there's a lot of tablets out there but this one is filling budget price 19 around 99 pounds
so it's a nice cheap option so we're going to do we'll open the box
fire it up and see what we can do with it
so here's the tablet in the box you get the tablet and a charge here which is micro
USB ok so here's a tablet just signed in with my Google account and nice clear bright screen
nice colors on there
I'm just signed in with my Google accounts so fire a few things up
so let me just give you some of the specs first
this screen is 1280 by 800
it's hard to show really on the camera bodies
it's definitely not reflective
I'm looking at it in here
suppose this is what you probably expect
it's got 16 gig of storage
which like I said
so let's see how well that works
I'll just turn it off
this usually shows up fingerprints quite well and actually
I have to say that works pretty
the material design yet
anyway he may come but say it's not the available moment
you also get a lot of these apps installed a support laces store
Asus said yes
you know these asa stuff which
I'm not that keen on
we've talked about these before these a be app
there's also a - cloud as well for storing stuff on the cloud but I tend not to use of
I just tend to use the standard Android services and drop boxes on there as well
come and we've got a front-facing camera as well which is 0.3
megapixels so okay maybe for selfies and go and that is really about it
but it's not too bad it's usable and certainly the 2 megapixel camera is usually on tablet
I mean I don't really want to take pictures on a tablet to be honest II
use a phone or my proper camera but it's nice to have the option
let's try some performance so here we are with the web browser
I'm accessing some of those services browser but once you're there it's okay
I think that the kind of things you would use this for
we'll try out some apps and see how that compares now
what about watching video on it
what a and let's just try a YouTube video
I'm actually there
let's just run the volume up
it's not sad it's pretty is decent loud
it's not too bad doesn't volume reasonable
that's clear actually
I really like that screen
considered is 1280 by 800
it's it looks really good on that
what for watching videos and something else that just spotted that it perhaps not understand
Android is just cost
something called float gadget where you can have a floating window now
you can go for gadget
and then you've got the option notepad a calculator whoops
let's just go see it there
I guess you it's not bad idea
think you could probably to a switch from app to app quite quite easy anyway
yeah there you go
it seems okay another nice feature that
I found here
is that double tap to wake which you just switched on here which is something
I use a lot on my Lumia phone
so you've got it
I miss that one
it's not on other devices
I use so I've just tried a
it's a game 3d game so as you can see
it seems fairly smooth like 3d games
the process is probably pretty good for the game
there wait so so now we've got a game and with the Atom processor
this seems fairly reasonable
and he's playing fairly well whoops
I'm attending choose
Windows tablets alone but if you want an Android tablet this is a good option at 99 quid
it's not expensive
it's got a sort of nice soft plastic back which quite like battery life
we'll have to wait and see
got some more testing to do on that
reasonable brightness not check the high resolution it doesn't feel too cheap
it feels quite nicely made
who is an 8 inch version as well
alright thanks for watching this video and simple and clear link to the written review on live.com
the Lenovo to add Chromebook is one of the most interesting tablets of the year
starting at just $279
we're getting a desktop class
Chrome browser a keyboard a pen option and updates for eight years
I'm and reformed on
Excel calm and in this review you will learn for who is this as a perfect tablet before we started
don't forget to subscribe to this channel
I'm reviewing pretty much
the tablet feared surprisingly high-end
that's because we get a mostly metal body
the upper part is made of a blue plastic
I think that looks fine but I know not everybody loves this
we're seven points three millimeters it is thin enough and with 450 grams
it weighs as much as a competition
it's a bit disappointing that we get just one
USB C port there's no headphone jack and no micro
you can connect use
PC hubs and also connect external monitors and other accessories
there's no fingerprint scanner and you can't unlock it using facial recognition either
that's certainly a downside
ratios that videos
the back of the tablet is protected
but the frame is unprotected
it's connected to the tablet using magnets and they're very strong
the cover is made of a plastic and the kind of fabric like material
it's not very premium feeling of course but that's okay
I like that you can open the kickstand quite wide
and that one has a metal hinge
the keyboard is connected using a magnetic connector
so you don't have to charge it separately
the keyboard is a bit smaller than a standard one still
I was able to type with it very fast
sure it might be because
I'm used to working with tablets
maybe you will have to get to use to it a bit but the keys
do offer a real treble which is great
we do get the touch pad which sits below the keyboard
the most important feature of the Lenovo Chromebook is Chrome OS a couple of years ago
I reviewed the Acer Chromebook tap 10 but no other
Chrome OS tablet has been released in Europe since then I know
yes ideas that means
it will be much longer today than any
Android tablet will be the heart of Chrome OS is the Chrome browser
it's fully desktop class
YouTube does not perform perfectly inside the browser
the tablet is so interesting because of Chrome at an affordable price
Chrome OS is very easy to navigate both by touchscreen and by keyboard and mouse in tablet mode
we get the kind of home screen like on
Android tablets here
open them side by side and close them in desktop mode
you can open several apps and three floating windows just like we're used to from windows
the desktop mode is a bit more stable and seems more finished
better thought through when using the do-it
Chromebook as a tablet I sometimes notice smaller issues
not all but most
I've installed YouTube Adobe Lightroom Netflix onedrive
it makes no sense to do so but you can do that as I said
Chrome OS is based on Linux
and in fact you can install normal
Chromebook I've installed a LibreOffice for instance and it runs fine the Lenovo IdeaPad wot
Chromebook has a 10.1 inch IPS screen with an aspect ratio of 16 by 10
it is a resolution of 1920 by 1200 pixels and as usual
it's quite bright with 400
nits and it's readable outside
viewing angles are very y2 sure on
you can watch
offer a better sound you can use the duet
it supports 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity
you can rest your palm on the screen for instance and it gets ignored
you can start a new node very quickly sustainer notes
stylus you can write handwritten notes on your droid
I think the pen is good enough
I wouldn't get it just for the stylus though if the pen is the most important feature for you
you're better off with the competition
you can get versions with 64 gigabyte and 128 gigabyte of internal storage
the tablet has to no micro SD card slot in benchmarks
the tablet gets pretty good results
Tab s 5e those are mid range tablets that cost about the same
the real-life performance is good too as I said so
the performance is excellent
that's the case regarding
I did manage to end the video
both games look better even on the cheapest iPad
they do perform as they do on a similar end
word tablet like the Galaxy Tab A six life though exactly this is what I can say about
other games like asphalt 9 and other similar games too
I wouldn't recommend it as a game tablet in particular
it surprised me in a positive way
I think severe you as fantastic
it's just $279
I'm not outstanding but certainly fine
if you don't want to work with your tablet it might not be suited for you though
it's not a great immediate tablet if you want to watch movies and play games
I think an N word tablet or iPad is much better suited
and if the pen is very important for you you should check out the competition too
let's check out the alternatives
is that you get access to lots of more apps that are optimized for tablets
s5e we can exit have s6
another direct competitor is the Microsoft Surface
it's much pricier though alright is at the end of my review of the lenovo - a chromebook
if you have any questions write them down below and subscribe to the channel as i said
i'm moving pretty much
every tablet it gets released a man's rifle mine
Xavier calm
thanks for watching and see you next time
hi guys come in here so today
I'm going to review the Bank u matrix pad s8
this is an 8-inch Android tablet very inexpensive
but let's see if it's worth your money
so let's do an unboxing
thank you very much so as I said this is an 8-inch Android tablets this is running
Android 9.0 Pi and its stock Android or vanilla Android so no bloatware which is great
let's peel off the plastic
open the box and see what's inside
so first is the tablet itself
we'll look at that in just a moment here
nothing on the bottom nothing on the left side and the top has your headphone jack micro
love to see that in the tablet here
you can see two gigs of RAM this is the s8 an Android version 9
and here's the specs so 8 inch
IPS display 1280 by 800 64-bit 1.3 gigahertz quad-core CPU
32 gig storage 4,000 milliamp battery good for about 8 to 10 hours
FM radio microSD expandable to 128 gigs and Google
assistance is built-in so when you pick up the tablet you'll notice it's very light
which makes it feel a bit inexpensive
but one good thing about that is if you're using it for extended periods
it's not going to feel like a heavyweight in your hand which is a good thing
the display is very vivid has excellent colors and very good
saturation which is surprising for an IPS
display very punchy colors so excellent for web browsing browsing the web is just excellent
it's a very nice tablet for a good price one $39.99 comedian
that's very nice in the head
it's very late
which is good and it doesn't have any blower which is a big positive for me
Store it still
it doesn't support that
Amazon will be a link in the description as well
I appreciate it and you can also check out my social media which is Instagram and Twitter
thanks for watching guys
we'll see in the next video take care
hello i'm here
doing another tablet review this time for xp pen innovator 16 big shiny pretty box
they've got like this cute little fox character
he's a chill little guy
it's very like pretty and modern looking with the silver and black
i really like how it looks
you can see there's like uh express keys there on the left
um but we're gonna be looking at that a bit later first
we'll go through
what else in the box
you've got like your plugs here on the left
they've included different types
depending on where you live so i think that's the european one this one is the uk one
it's got a little usb
um plug in it
and that's how you attach your tablet power to the to the pluggy thingy this is the stand
it's very simple
we'll have a look at it a bit later
here is the pen it comes in this really nice
little cylindrical box
i don't show it but on the other side of this box um it stores a whole bunch of pen nibs
this is the pen itself
it's not a chargeable pen
so that's nice
no batteries
no charging or anything
there's no eraser but there are these two express keys and it does feel like a really nice pen
there's the quick guide that has the installation instructions
it's not as long as it looks
it's just all loads of different languages in there
there's a little cleaning cloth that you get which is very nice
yeah it's a three-in-one cable
it's like the hdmi
the usb the uh pluggy thingy to go into the actual tablet and power it and connect it to your pc
so that's all handy randy dandy
i'm gonna go over that a bit later to show
which plug goes where
this is where i immediately screwed up because i took off
it kills me so what you're going to do is pull that tag
i'm an idiot
this is the stand
we're back to this bad boy
uh you just pop out the back like that you can see
these ones on the left will be going into your pc
so there's the black hdmi and the black usb
those would be both going into your pc
i point at the diagram there and this is what it looks like
there's also a little look at the specs there for you so download the driver
that's applicable to you
whether that's mac or windows i have windows so i'm gonna download that one
when you open that it'll ask you to install
i thought it felt really nice like while i was drawing this
i didn't really feel uncomfortable any point i wasn't really stuck to my tracks
um you can see sort of the comparison with me going really slow and fast
the response is really nice
the pressure is really nice
um the tilt is a little bit off you can see
it wouldn't quite pick it up
you can see here that it works totally fine
it was just on occasion
they're like oh do i do
i was surprised that you didn't have to
i'm probably gonna keep plugging it into the wall anyway
but having that as an option is really cool
i'll go over the pros and cons
um it's very modern and attractive looking
i love the silver and black
it's very it's very sleek
the pen doesn't need charging at all
so that's great no charging or no batteries or anything just works right off
the bat can be powered by just the computer alone like we covered
and yeah the slim design makes it extra portable
i thought could be a little better like there wasn't a whole lot of um choice in that
i mean the choices
there were fine but i was kind of like as i mentioned before
um it did fix when i minimized photoshop and maximized it again
i was drawing so i was like
it's a bit weird but with with every tablet you're gonna have weird little glitches
that happens like i've heard so many weird things about wacom's modern tablets that i just
i don't think i'd trust any of their newer tablets anymore
well they're they're newer monitor tablets like they're pros and stuff
the the cables are kind of finicky
so i'm probably gonna keep using it for a little bit longer
um i have to do some freelance animation next
so i haven't used it with anything else so it might not be compatible with certain programs
yeah that's it um
i hope this has been informative for you
i think this is a pretty decent tablet again
i've only used it for a few weeks
but it's been pretty damn good
um i'm gonna keep using it for a little bit
i'll update you guys later so uh thanks for watching
it's sorry it's a sponsored video but um yeah thank you
i'll see you again sometime
see you later you
these are my tyd tablets now
the box is the tablet itself
which is what we'll go through
you get a stylus
so it's not a pen is just a stylus earbuds which are fine charging cable you get a micro
you'd put a nano
SIM actually says on though if you can see it you put a nano SIM into this
so that's what's in the box
just move the other one in addition to that
you also get a plug charger
so it's an octa-core processor
it's a true sim and you also can put a micro SD card in it as well
10.1 inch screen is
it's not a glass screen
it's a plastic screen
so you do have to watch out for scratching so it's advisable to put the screen protector on
I'll just be using these Wireless
so that's the only reason why
I'm not going to be using that now
the back is that's metal
obviously plastic round
just turn it on
so tyd is the name it runs on android 6 which is the KitKat
take it down so it's nice and low but anyway alright now
we'll come back to this shortly
ok so you can see that we're now connected to the whole network and obviously when
I'm in the shop so I'll have to connect it to the to the shop network as well is the standard
I'm just gonna check to see whether there's any software updates on it
it's one of the first things you've got to do
it always useful
see what's going on
get some videos to show you how to do
things get that downloaded put various others on as well and then we can
we can see actually an operation with the video going you can listen to the sound
but if you have a look up you've got your Wi-Fi so you click on to there
click onto that and again it brings up all the available
Wi-Fi click on there
here's a picture that I took earlier
we've just gone to that not the best
you can put whatever you want on there
I've put YouTube on just so that you can hear it more than anything else
it's a little bit tinny
I will turn it off vehicle 20 volume those you can hear and that is you can see the motion
that's coming through those speakers
just turn against us pause it so
I was saying there was plenty of volume a little bit Timmy
but reduce it in size
so there's your YouTube app again
take it back screens nice and responsive
I haven't put the screen protector on
they are easy to scratch so all in all sixty pounds each great absolutely fantastic
it's a certainly a recommendation anywhere
nice and quick to charge
they hold the charge
easy to set up can't go wrong
what's up guys
Euler here welcome to a new channel and don't be reviews so for our first review
I've got here the Lenovo Tab 8 10
it was around 100 bucks so
I'm really curious to see what it has to offer
it has the Android Oreo it has a 10.1 HD IPS multi-touch has 2 gigabytes of RAM
also it comes with 16 gigs of hard drive but you can expand it with an SD card
alright so let's take it out of the plastic so my first impression is it has big bezels
it feels really light and thin
it's not gonna be a problem just by holding it
it can tell it
it's a pretty cheap quality
it's what you expect
I already set it up
so so my first impressions are that it's a bit leggy
it takes a while to launch apps
its it has a pretty slow response
the frame rates look decent the overall picture
it looks great
so that's a good sign
so that's a positive thing
so it has a pretty decent sound quality for $100 tablet
so you can get
it's not as loud as a more expensive tablet but it's a pretty decent
so it's not really the best position for a camera to be in a tablet also
depends on the way you're holding the tablet
so that's that was really confusing to me at first also
I don't really like the bezos
it has like a pretty pretty big bezels
let's talk about the cameras
let me just take some pictures and see how they perform
well it's looking pretty good
it's a five megapixel camera on the back
it's nothing too impressive
so moving on to the thumb facing camera
it's a two megapixel camera
I'm gonna take a picture so you guys can see the quality
it's really just a very low quality camera for FaceTime or Skype calls
so it's not really a good quality camera it's just work a very specific usage so finally
let's talk about the recording quality
I'm just going to record a video
I'm kind of blown away by the mic quality
I wasn't expecting it to be like this good so overall what I'm most like about
this tablet is first
its has a pin and light design
so if you're using it with one hand or you just laying down in bed it's not gonna bother you
also as a pre for $100 tablet
I was expecting it to have decent cell quality and a decent screen
this would be a pretty good option for you
thank you so much for watching
hit that like button
subscribe to the channel and I'll see you guys in the next video
what is going on guys griggles
TV this is the symbols tango
let's just talk about that real quick
display means you're knockin
so and that should work perfectly great
and that's what
I've noticed
pretty much resolution 720p plus so
it's not 1080p if not 2k it's not the most amazing display
I've seen but it does get fairly bright
you also have a micro SD card slot that to add up to 128 gigabytes of storage
I'll show you in a minute
Wi-Fi it does 2.4
and 5 gigahertz networks also
it's in here which is awesome and then ports which also
you're going to get a microphone
which basically is really a microphone
headphone jack you get a micro
USB mini HDMI full USB port
that's a full-size USB port
you also get right here
you could put like a keyboard because they do have a version of this
that does have a keyboard that goes for 139
if you want to get there
they also have a kid's version of this tablet as well if you have a kid inside the box
that's not all you also get a case inside of this
this is also a lot of time
so let's jump around this tablet just a little bit and talk about its performance
I'll talk about one thing I don't like at all and that's the sound
let's turn the volume up
sound is like
I said absolutely horrendous
pretty good on this
you can see the screen right here
let's push this video
see how high we can push it
that's at 360
let's put it that
looks like the highest
I can do a video on here 720 60 and you can see
it's playing it absolutely fine
just make sure it's switched over
yep make sure you can't go any higher yep so 7 2016 be able to do for any video on here since
it's not a 1080p screen
it wouldn't make sense for it to be able to do 1080p but it plays it absolutely fine you can see
I could jump ahead really quickly
so the the Wi-Fi is quick with it videos
load up quick
let me just bring up another video of mine
actually this is
I can play this one
this is my video as well when I had a vlog so you can see it starts up really really quick
there's no problems weird performance and trying to loading up videos
you can see the angles are really good awesome
another cool thing you can do is you can actually run two windows at the same time
and it's loading up that website websites go on and I'll play a video there
you go playing a video surf from the web at the same time now if you play a game
I've noticed that gets a little funky on there and you can see it
the videos a little bit choppy when
and there you go watching a video surfing the web so it is doable on here
you can make the window bigger or smaller
if you want so pretty cool that you can do all that stuff with this tablet next up
let's check out some games
I'll play tag with Orion and subway surfer
it's not amazing amazing but for 129 bucks for a kid or for an older person
who's just looking for something to watch videos on or do simple simple games
you'll definitely be able to do that
let me jump into another game cuz
I'm not very good at these games
so let up subway surfer all right here
we go subway surfer similar game to the Ryan's world world game and performance again
still the same there where you can get decent performance on this
I'm gonna die
oh he's catching up to me
see if I can get running
I am not good at these games but I always say that
I'm not good at any game
that's why ooh train come in doing really well is the best
I ever did on this game
oh my gosh
are you supposed to do that
yeah you can see it
plays a game absolutely fine and then just to show you how it web surfs not by multitasking
but just you know loading up a website and seeing how it performs on here
let's just load up a website
click on one of these stories
how about nothing too depressing
how about Elon
Musk from the guy from Tesla
click on his story so usually it works
I mean it's it's not the best-performing tablet and it's not supposed to be it's 139 bucks
if you're curious at the bottom you have a back button home
button recent apps button and then you also have a screenshot button dedicated which you can so
I didn't see a ton of customization
like when you go in a display you can come in here and you can turn off that screenshot button
Google duo so you can do some you know chatting on this
you could take photos
I probably wouldn't know fully recommend it
you know and it's you can see there's nothing on here
it's a cool little tab
that one's 129 as well
so link down below
check it out if you're looking for an expensive budget tablet
we'll see you guys down the road
all right so
I'm super late for dinner
so this is a Xiaomi media writing tablet
I think they call it all right so my dad just called cut my video off
that is a problem but anyway
so yeah there's absolutely no way
I can zoom into the exact serial number and you can't really press too hard and this
I'll talk later about that
so let's try
and very nice flicker rejection on
iOS 13
I phone eight all right so yeah
let's actually use the tablet to talk about it so first of all right
this is weird
read this just has the one button which
I have locked but I will not press because I'm too afraid
there is a ton of dust here
packaging is pretty nice so they have
Xiaomi does very beautiful stuff though
this tablet is absolutely no exception 13.5 inches so it is large
it's about this much shorter than an a4 and about this much narrower
I think it's exactly I checked it earlier
so it's pretty much an a4
does this say anything
I mean I yeah why not
it's it leads the nice design so yeah
I don't mind it
it's totally ok
I'm not angry about it
it's fine yes
I think we're done with the with the general stuff and yes so let me bring in the can
oh yeah this is filthy
um she had the pen is completely passive is xiaomi branded
i think it's supposed to latch
holy a dozen didn't have money for my okay at latches
sorry sorry-sorry pen also latches to other magnetics things but like briefly
just barely sad
this is basically the best part for it
that's it's it's not like it's easier to take off
its not gonna survive in a bag but it's good enough right
this is so i was saying that
i think i'm not should i finished it's $23 including shipping
i mean not too bad so basically what this is is one of those boogie boards with a battery right
so you can't locally erase this button only erases absolutely everything on the screen right
so i've written some some some pros and cons before that
this is amazingly large
it's pressure sensitive
it is with the pen
let me actually zoom in right if you press super hard
it's gonna draw a super thick line
and if you do it right you do have some pressure control which is pretty cute and now
I'm barely touching it right so I'm barely barely pressing down on it
yeah so that is adequate
I'd say I don't have any complaints
I don't know does it get smudges when you bend
it is the question and no
it doesn't so no pressure hotspots on the inside at least none that
I can immediately see or none that have developed yet
so that's that's nice
I mean Xiaomi does beautiful like nicely done stuff
there's no locally raised
I mean this is the biggest problem if somehow they could get that fixed
you have to cut it you have to cross it
there's absolutely no way
otherwise you have to erase the whole and my
OCD isn't as bad
it isn't evolved
no it isn't like far along enough to warrant like starting fresh if right so
I don't know so it ends up being like that
it bothers me mildly
let me actually bring in a four
it's pretty good
I don't know decent and what else
yeah so contrast is definitely not a strong suit
you can see that
I've made a line here where I pressed on the screen and left a lot of on it
what else
yeah this this color with blue eh
I think there's others that have different colors or they just
the people just have different lights
I had no idea the lock
there's a lock button right which technically now is set to lock
it's actually zoom in on this because everything done is everything like design wise
this is very beautiful right so lock and unlock and so now technically
it's locked so that's probably just in series with the lock button and yeah so again lock
I don't know I do enjoy you Kiki given that
it's it's fully analog
I mean that doesn't make much sense right so I guess right what you would do with
I'm sorry so
let's write something on this habit display something so show me a writing tablet
what is this like
I don't mind the writing experience at all
this is 400 euros
used is what I paid for this
it is battery powered so this is a lot more kit than this
it has some some
Wacom style surface pink
write the traditional ink right
this is some kind of LCD technology and yeah this is not too bad oh
it's a lot of money right
language is completely to my liking
I love it this is how I do it
let's make it big and you have colors
you have black so you can go like this
I'll show you guys the colors so colors would would look like this
so this is a basically a vivid
I'm I'm fine with it
there's tools right so you can move stuff around alright as you can move stuff
you can copy stuff duplicate stuff
it is pretty slow so right now you haven't seen it be slow and I don't mean the e-ink right
the ink is fine
you can't technically write on this as well but this pen is the same shot
it is very nice so you have a bunch of tools right
so there's different styles of pens right
you can't get finer pens right so this is basically the
you can't but again this is pretty powerful right so
I need to go back to a hundred no pinch to zoom
it's saying move doesn't work anymore and why the doesn't move work anymore like
I really would like to move stuff right and say that doesn't work
that is a bummer
and you get this thing up here so that's always gonna be there
moving around is also pain in the ocean
moving around is also a pain in the ass you can see now all the
UI runs super fast
this isn't always the case right so
I will say that at times it is a bit annoying
Phone no there's no Windows Phone app
I'm sorry like if if you're watching this video and you still have Windows
Phone a rock on brother rock on like there's not many it's not many of you left
I took some took some sketches for a YouTube video
which is is yet to be released so this might actually come out come out faster
there's layers so this is nice stuff right and again all this stuff we do have a little
well it says it's connected so no anyway and I do have the coolest Wi-Fi name anyway
I want to move right this little thing right
I don't want to move it to page three
yeah out of luck you can't and so
that's that's a bummer
right eraser has also this like selection mode
what else can I say about it
it's a nice tablet
I mean for a prototype
it is incredibly well
charging port has a little metal reinforcement so again
that's very cute given that this is made of plastic
I'm I'm impressed by how well it's tucked together
so the front display sheet
let's call it is is perfectly adhered
and this is a first-gen unit right so this was made in 2017 this was ordered with on
well not super clicky
but they're clicking so they're decently clicking
let's just leave it at that and see it uploads the stuff it has
Wi-Fi I had some some talks with the support team
this is like the first round of production so the fact that it is done so nicely is is very
this little leather pouch is super nice
it fits the pen very snugly
there's absolutely no way this is falling out and it's pretty expensive
I don't know but extremely well done and fits the table
well so you if you find on
but if you don't have the time for that this is a super good option
everything about it is super nice
Xiaomi tablet is also pretty interesting
it's a completely different use case scenario though so comparing them is
I think 90 times up until now
yeah that's about it any other questions
leave them down in the comments
all for sure answer them as I get more familiarized with both these devices right
I had the remarkable for like a few weeks and this I've had for a few minutes
so yeah alright come on
what's going on guys long hair from Android authority and good
Android tablets are hard to find and great Android tablets
all wrapped
up in a super thin chassis
OEMs haven't thought of moving the power and volume to the short side for larger size tablets
up top followed by a large plastic flap that covers the microSD and sim slot
it's bright vivid has great viewing angles and color saturation
thanks to the powerful
tablet isn't a problem at all
I haven't ran into such an issue
the tablet has never shut down on me or ceased operation of an application and even though
sony has also made a big emphasis with audio on the z4 tablet
Sony's audio enhancements through these speakers
they're loud crisp and clear and don't show any signs of distortion
that's expandable up to an additional 128 gigs by a microSD
this is fresh water
more casual use
the z4 tablet doesn't necessarily change that
but some of them can be a lot of fun
should you decide to use them picture
just fine if you're in a pinch but you'll be setting yourself up for disappointment
if you're expecting the same level of quality that can be achieved on a smartphone
it takes decent photos and good lighting
Sony's Xperia Y which is arguably still one of the better Android skins out there the Xperia U
I changes a few things from stock
Android like the color scheme and customizable
you've also got the life log application which has become a standard app across
Sony's most recent devices and it's great for not only tracking your fitness data
allow you to play virtually anywhere you want in your home
this is definitely a huge selling point for ps4 owners
and there's also another version that comes with an included keyboard dock for 759
these prices put it squarely an Apple iPad territory
that couldn't be more true
so what is it about the z4 tablet that makes it a great
Android tablet well
and it's about time and om finally got it right as always guys
thank you so much for watching this video
if you did enjoy please give it a thumbs up down below
this is the Huyen canvas 13
this is the 2020 version of one of whom's most popular pen displays
I needed to use sandpaper to get all the features working properly
here's how you could avoid that
hello my name is
Brad and I review tech for creative professionals people like you
illustrators designers at one-horse they taught to paint the hue on canvas
thirteen is a pen display
if you're new here you need a computer
this has to be plugged into a computer
it's just a fancy-pants monitor
hey bro additionally though this display can be plugged into certain
Android phones or tablets and used that way as well
inch display to be exact
I think we've reached a plateau and drawing technology in recent years
we've seen big gains in the line quality
we've seen big gains in the quality of the screens
they're putting into these things and if
I was to guess where we would go next
I would say we would see an increase in the screen resolution or adding some touch features
and that's what this pen
I think it nails that landing
fiver my dream of making my ultimate game may finally come true they've partnered with phase
Blais to launch blazes ultimate game idea contest
here's how it works
submit your game idea by April 13th
and when you submit you will keep a hundred percent of the rights of your idea and game
Times Square Madison Square Garden everywhere
can't program doesn't matter can't draw still doesn't matter
all you need is creativity
your game can be 8-bit 3d futuristic retro VR AR
Yan has been experimenting with things like Android support and also the look of these displays
it comes in three colors
there's violet purple midnight green and Cosmo black
I went with the Cosmo black and I kind of regret it
I wish I went with the purple
just because it's different
take it brand
this isn't new but it's worth mentioning here
this is a laminated screen
this increases your accuracy
the screen itself has an anti-glare coating on it
you can see pretty well in my videos because I have a lot of lights shining above
but when you just have it on your desk and you're sitting in normal lighting conditions
it doesn't really reflect that much
it also provides a little bit of drawing resistance
feels good to use with the stylus and it's not too slick
it appears that all that is gone
it is a nice step forward
feels good when
I'm drawing
I do get some check marks on really fast lines not something
I noticed when I was drawing just when I was testing it out
Studio Medi bang
I couldn't replicate the Photoshop problem
all of them seemed to work pretty well
I also tested on Windows and it doesn't look like it does it
they're just on the
Mac and I did test on two Macs both running catallena
there are some extras in this package
there's a nice little stand that you can prop up at a couple different angles
and there's also a pen holder that comes with some extra nibs tucked inside and yes
there are two drawing gloves
no no you cannot make me
what does come in
the box is a three-in-one cable
that's pretty standard with pen displays
these days in fact most have shipped with one of these cables over the last several years
I use for most of this review but I love the idea of being able to just use a USBC cable
just having one cable provide your power and your data in that HDMI port
I have a little bit of a situation here
you can order that
I have cables like that
but here's my problem
the port is not flush with the side of the device like it is on lapped
it's sunk in a little bit
that means the plastic edge of your cable has to be really narrow to fit into that space
it requires a special cable
I tried a bunch of different cables to find one that would fit and I did find one problem is
that's the cable that came with my Mac for charging
it doesn't work for transmitting data and a signal so it jumped on Amazon
look for a good cord with a good transfer rate that could also pass power and I bought
it looks narrow enough to me catches
those tend to be more pricey
no it's here so
I couldn't test this I was
I was really disappointed
and since it required the same kind of cable in order to test all of these new Android features i
I couldn't test those either
I couldn't find it on their website
and so instead I I googled
Huyen USBC cable and that's how I found it on their website
and jeez it's $40
functionality isn't available for every device there's a list of compatible
Android devices over on who
Yuans website if you're using Samsung
you're gonna have to toggle on decks to get everything running well
decks turns your phone or tablet into a desktop like interface
now you can control your computer with your pen display
it works fine with a pen but I will admit I really wish this had a touchscreen
it's just really hard to unwire years
it doesn't open it
feels great to draw in but it doesn't go fullscreen
my best paint
X can go fullscreen but it doesn't have any pressure sensitivity
whoo yawn themselves
have their own drawing app now
it's fairly new
it's painting app called hue on sketch which I reviewed weeks ago
it doesn't have pen pressure or go
fullscreen the winner from all of the art apps
I tried was definitely infinite painter
it's fully operational here
goes full screen
this is partly because of the things
I mentioned above like the apps not supporting it fully
the keyboard appears on your Android tablet or phone off to the side and not on the screen itself
so you're constantly repositioning yourself now
these are just some of the growing pains that come with adopting a new interface so like the
Wacom one this is a cool idea
it feels like a step towards something cool but the software and the hardware
it's just not there yet and for the canvas itself
I think that USBC cable is gonna be an issue
I think this cable problem is gonna cause a lot of people headaches anybody who tries to use those
I have no problem with saying
hey this is a great pen display
go for it have fun
I really like a lot of things about it
it's just that when you get to those new features especially those Android features
that are very similar to this
so if you have any comments or questions let me know down below in the comments
thank you for watching and I'll talk to you a couple of things you
it is much cheaper because prices are starting at just $80
so how good can such a cheap tablet be
I mange for my next ever calm
and that's what we will find out in this review the design and big quality of
Scylla no vote at m7 is fantastic
who would have thought that
that's because renova is shipping
DTaP m7 with a metal body
it might sound a bit weird but the blade quality really is excellent in this price range
okay but actually that's mostly the end of me praising it
we're getting a micro
SD card slot and a headphone jack
speaking of the headphone jack
you will need it if you want to listen to music or watch movies
there's one single speaker placed above the screen and while it's loud enough
the sound quality is bad
the speaker sounds flat
and there's no real dice at all
many phones are much better speakers
I don't think that's too much of a downside
it was fine for everybody
I like that
the viewing angles are wide enough to see something when looking from the sides it is
IPS screen other aspects like color reproduction contrast and brightness are okay
it's not a top performer
MTN were 21 quad-core processor
well these are the options in some countries
I'm using the version was 1 gigabyte of RAM in the 16
gigabyte internal storage
which is the only one available
enjoy a meeting right now
you can see my benchmark comparison that the performance of the tap m7 is very bad
it's goes to worse than the cheaper
Amazon fire 7 benchmarks like and to to the test
I've been doing with it
the performance is good enough for that reading
just don't have too high expectations while you can watch
HD videos in this case I noticed occasional legs when watching with this resolution
it is very disappointing that its performance is too weak for basic multitasking
during my time with this tablet
the tab m7 is not a gaming tablet of course very simple games do run however
there is no split screen view for example
if you want you can install the normal versions using the
Play Store but they don't run as well in the case of Chrome and YouTube
we do get server versions
lenovo did not customized
UI at all which is great
we're getting pretty much
vanilla and word 9 goal
in addition to those google apps are couple of standard ones pre-installed
like a calculator the camera app
and it'll be audio app
but that's it since this is a super cheap device
I don't expect it to ever get Android 10 go
they know was pretty bad with updates in general still
I like the software
it's a good decision from Lenovo to use
and what go
because operating system itself suman's quite smoothly by the way
according to the press release are talking about ram version will be shipped with normal
Android ninth I in my bed
for my bed we test
I'm always looping the same HD video ad million brightness until the tablet shut themselves off
alright let's get to the end of my
Lenovo type m7 review
I can recommend it in a couple of circumstances
only if you want to spend as little money as possible and prefer pure Android
YouTube for instance
but it's important that you know that you will have to make compromises in this price
range the tab m7 has quite a lot of potential
it's very quality is fantastic and the screen and bed.you
more you can get much better performing tablets
let's check out some alternatives
a direct competitor is the Amazon fire 7
even though it's even cheaper worse prices starting at just 50 dollars it does feel a bit faster
N word you've got to live with Amazon's version which does not include the Play Store
a 8.0 even though both costs around $130 you do get normal
I'm reviewing pretty much
every tablet that is released almost worldwide
thanks for watching
and we'll see you next time
hey everybody its la inside but and we're taking a look today at the new
Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet
all the opinions you're about to hear are my own
Amazon calls them special offers
it is pretty much the same from a hardware standpoint
it's a mediatek mt6752 bytes and it also has 16 gigabytes of internal storage
you've got really nice
viewing angles on it
really not bad as a reading device or media consumption device decent color on it
but you'll notice the screen is very shiny
I don't like the dress products up here on the channel
so this is what its gonna look like when you get it out of the box and start playing with it
I could say to the tablet here while it's off
it will do any of the echo commands
Hamlet the only other tablet up until now that did this was their 10 inch version
so for $79 you can get a echo device with a screen which
I thought was kind of nice
this is running fire
OS 6 which is the new version of Amazon's operating system now this is derived from Android
there's ways to get it on here but it's not all that consumer friendly
it's not something that a lot of consumers are going to do
not much for ports on this one
SD cards on here
this will take up to a 400 gigabyte card
last year's version topped out at around 200 gigabytes
so if you have a lot of media to put in you can get it in there
you got a camera here on the back
so you could use wireless devices with it one thing
I've heard from people over the years is that sometimes
this connector causes some trouble over time
I don't think this will be any better or worse than prior versions there
so just be careful
when you're plugging in that charging cable headphone jack is right here
you got a built-in microphone over there
this will support headsets
too with microphones built-in and you've got a volume rocker over there
battery life on this
they say is up to 10 hours
I think that's probably realistic
so let's take a look now and see how it performs and we'll begin with some basic web browsing here
even videos are popping up here without too many problems
I can hit play on that
and see how that streams up here so you can see by and large
it's not bad from a general browsing standpoint now
you'll notice some of those web pages really
don't load up all that quickly
and maybe act a little sluggish on this particular tablet
this is partly due to the fact that the processor is getting a bit long in the tooth
it's not going to be a speed demon if you are a YouTube fan
and what they've put together
is this fake app
which is what
so what you're looking at here is essentially the mobile web version of YouTube
it's not even running at 720p here at least from what my eyes see so it's really not an ideal
YouTube experience and a lot of the features you might get from an official YouTube app
that just loads right up very very quickly here
because it's so tightly integrated with the device and its operating system after all
Amazon tablets are designed for you to be purchasing Amazon content
and they make that a very smooth process here
and it's noticeably faster than any of the other services that are available on this platform now
a lot of these are the same versions that you'll find on the other
Android platforms this is the Android version of Minecraft
you can certainly get by with this
you can get emulators to play some of those old games or you can download remakes like this one
this is the remake of Sonic CD and it works with my Bluetooth game controller
just fine here
Amazon turn on show mode and you can see here now
the regular fire
OS interface has disappeared
and now we have this persistent echo show interface
I would see if I had a echo show device what I'm noticing though
they sell a dock for about 40 dollars
turn off show mode and then it will revert back to that tablet interface
likewise you can also do it from up on your pull down control panel there so it's pretty cool
Amazon devices with a screen so by and large
I think it's an OK tablet
I have two children
I've got a five-year-old in a two year old the five year olds iPad is smashed to bits
it's caked with yogurt
and who knows what
I do recommend though from a performance standpoint
I think this is definitely something worth considering at
it's very reasonable $79 price tag until next time this is lon

hey what's going on guys this
ETA brought back here again today
it actually took a while to ship out
and if you're a regular viewer of the channel you know
they also offer a 128 gigabyte model at 299
that's what I have here
you're also gonna receive some extra accessories that make this a real
Chromebook now this comes with the 64 gigabyte model or the 128 gigabyte model
millimeter audio
jack unfortunately there is no headphone
jack built into the tablet
so you will have to use this adapter over
the keyboard is really nice
it's got a decently sized trackpad given that we have a 10.1
inch tablet here key
I'm used to typing on a full-size keyboard
it works great
I'm really into the tablet aspect of this
and if it's sitting on the desk it's fine with that kickstand up but if
I want to carry this around
I'm not going to add all of these accessories so like I mentioned for the tablet itself
the build quality is amazing
this has that dual tone
it's ice blue and iron gray
I think it looks amazing
I think these sound amazing
the tablet uses USB type-c gen 2 for charging and syncs
mp3 at 800 megahertz
we have 4 gigs of lpddr4
X Ram like I said you can get these
in two variants 64 gigabytes of storage and 128 gigabytes of storage
unfortunately it does not offer a microSD card option
so you're gonna be stuck with what you have
the screen on the duet is actually really nice
it's a 10.1 inch IPS display at 1920 by 1200 with 400 nits of brightness
so this thing does get pretty bright
everything looks correct on the screen
it's got a 7 thousand milliamp hour battery and they're claiming 10 plus hours of usage
it's obviously running
Chrome OS and we do have access to Android apps
which is a big plus for a tablet like this
they actually work really well
we also have that video out like I mentioned and dual stereo speakers that support Dolby Atmos
and here's a look at the unit fully assembled we have the kickstand cover and the keyboard
we have that kickstand
it's magnetically attached
and it's not going anywhere
there's actually two modes here
I mean it feels just like any other
I do want to mention this
I would go with something like the Galaxy
Tab s6 light but if you absolutely have to have Chrome OS built-in for school or work
this is a great option along with Chrome OS and the ability to run Android apps
we can also access
Linux apps if you go into the settings you can enable the beta of Linux on Chrome OS and overall
it actually works really well here
it's not going to work here
there has to be an arm hf version like here
this does work on arm
I do a review on a tablet
you'll have no trouble using it
it is Chrome OS
we just have a touch interface when the keyboards detached so the first benchmark
I ran with Geekbench 5
this is strictly testing the CPU out over on the Left
we have the duet over on the right
we have a similarly priced tablet
the new tab s6 slide
we scored a 263 multi-core 932
if we look at the tab s6 light we did score a bit higher and keep in mind this is
I used for this was 3dmark
sling shot extreme
we're only able to test
OpenGL on the duet because it's not supporting Vulcan
we scored a 1000 105 and over on the tab s6 light we scored a 1547 and we also have Vulcan support
and that'll definitely help out and games that support
Vulcan but as you can see the tab s6 Lite beat out the duet once again
I have Netflix
and unfortunately this is the phone version of Netflix
it's not the big HD version still
it looks great and playback is fine as long as you have a decent internet connection
I'm connected to my 5 gigahertz network and everything seems to work
great here earlier in the video
I figured we'd go ahead and give that a test here we have Minecraft Pocket Edition
I'm using the beta version so I can see the FPS
I'm set to 10 chunks and I have fancy graphics off when I just blew up all of that dynamite
we went down to around 1
next up we have
King of Fighters all-stars
I personally love this game - the in-app purchases but I still play it
I don't buy anything
overall on low-end hardware this really struggles to play perfectly and unfortunately on the duet
Call of Duty mobile and this is definitely playable on the duet
this is a very well optimized game it works really good on low-end Android tablets
I've tested in the past
so it's pretty sure we'd have good luck with this one
I recommend an Xbox one controller over Bluetooth so I got to give it to Lenovo here
my first impressions of the duet are pretty good
I'm actually really impressed
the screen looks great
it's got awesome sound and we also have
do not pick this up but if you have to have
Chrome OS installed and you're looking for a cheap solution
I mean it's definitely not a tablet anymore but with the accessories removed
this is an awesome slim
I think it's a pretty decent deal here
I'm a hardcore chrome OS user
but that's pretty much it for this one
thanks for watching
oh hey
this is the innovators 16
this is meant to be like a slightly higher end version of their other 16 inch tablet that
I also reviewed recently so today we're gonna find out what's different about this one
why is it more expensive
and which one you should get
the innovator 16 is meant to be a higher-end version of the artist
15.6 pro by
XP pen tablet that they released last year
it costs $500 u.s.
compared to the other tablet that's only 450 now $50 difference is not a whole lot
let's check out what's in the box when you open it
the first thing you see is the tablet itself of course in an underneath here
well we have all the other goodies
so we're gonna have the outlet adapters on the left there
15.6 bro
little wiping cloth nothing too interesting in the other box here
we have the the cables so this is going to be the same
Hydra cable that you would find on the other tablet
I didn't notice any difference between the two
also fun fact they are interchangeable
I well that I've noticed
obviously is the look of it so it looks significantly different
it looks it looks better to me at least then
the artist series
you also get the same film covering the screen
Nikolaas screen so once again
I'm not a big fan of that because it can get damaged pretty easily
of course you can always swap it out to a brand new one but I don't want to have to do that
I wish for this version
they use a stronger glass instead
it's a hundred and twenty five percent so not really any different and really
this tablet is just an almost identical clone of their previous model
but with a slimmer profile and a nicer design in my opinion
that's going to be identical
the height is a little bit less on the newer tablet than your model
I couldn't notice any difference now just to check
so which is my naked eye
I could spot a slight difference but it is very slight slightly better now
so there's a slight slight delay in activation
so this is something I'm really
at least that's what it feels like when using it
I was also slightly disappointed when I when I first got it that
it wasn't any more than 1080p but then against once
I found out that the price difference was only 50 dollars
the surface feels good
there is not much parallax and it's very very responsive of course
I tested all the usual
I'm getting used to it
that's very fine
though as you see me working here it wasn't really a problem
it's definitely not something that I keep thinking about as I'm working
and it will scratch up if you remove the film and the initial activation of the pen
is that everything
it's doing something right but basically
I have this one
I just can't draw because I forgot to charge the damn pen
not enjoyable very affordable though and this one here think
I need to explain the iPad a little bit before I get a ton of hate comments
I'll have one myself and I just really hate using it
of course this is more of a personal thing yeah
I've never really enjoyed the experience
then it fits in here if it's both affordable and enjoyable then it's great value
that's a great place to be
it's a great build quality great technology and affordable
I get bug or something that makes it really annoying to use and here
I couldn't think of any to put in that section next
we have amazing but expensive tablets
we're still looking for this one
now where do you think
I'm going to place the innovator 16 in the context of this chart here
oh there it is so here very similar to its little brother
the artist 15.6 bro
the main difference between the two here is that
it's a little bit slimmer
looks better to me
adds to the enjoyment
yeah there you go as long as the tablet is in the purple the brown or the dark green section
it's what
I consider the real
I was expecting a little bit more but as I said at the beginning $50 difference is not a big deal
it really depends what $50 is worth to you
me personally yes
I would probably take the innovator 16 over the artist
15.6 bro
I just think it looks better for traveling and that kind of stuff
it's really not gonna change much
they're both so similar
they weighed the same
so in my opinion yes it is totally worth it
that's a little bit more premium kind of overall
so there you go
I haven't mentioned that you think people shouldn't know about so
yeah that's that
I hope the review was helpful all right
I'll see you guys
welcome to the video from the lifestyle
I come in this video
we're going to look at this
Lenovo ThinkPad x1 tablet
it's a port convertible tablet
you can see here
let me start at the beginning of this
so it's a convertible slice
look at it as a tablet first
doing what really not a convertible of course
Windows 10 supports the tablet mode
so let's stick in tablet mode so as a tablet it's supported rotation all the usual stuff
you you want
it's quite light this about the same way as a surface pro 3 to its profile
include the full specs and on the blog post on the dish live.com
that goes with the video as well but use it as a as a tablet really nicely
it's very it's got nice smooth curved edges it feels nice and smooth in terms of port
we've got Kensington lock we've got volume headphone
it's lovely in quiet
it's not getting too hot
we'll talk about performance in a bit
it's got a few things that the surface pro or my certainty
that's quite nice on the dot on the a
so that means you can plug your SIM card in and use it
use data when you're traveling so if you've got them what you can get them what we can get it
a data only SIM card
it's really very nice tablet
it doesn't move right it doesn't push back
you can push right the way back on this
it takes a lot to get it to click back down again so on your lap
it actually balances quite well
there's some travel on the keyboard
I think you could type reasonably quick on this
and there's a nice big trackpad that sports 2 finger scrolling things like that
there's also um Poynter if you like those kind of things you can use that
I used to have those on laptops years ago and got used to them and then now I've got you so trap
Pat's a person
I prefer a trackpad
but with this you've got the option of the trackpad and the three button
Mouse and the pointer it as well right spec wise
it's a core m7 processor with plenty
which gives you plenty of grunt it's got eight gig of ram and a 256 gig
SSD drive on there
there's plenty performance it
you'd have no problems
editing videos on here power do
what's really good so it's a really good performing machine for that
it doesn't get too hot even even while playing stuff like minecraft
I often use minecraft
it got dark
it's a good example to talk
it works really well on there
no problems at all
she'll have no problems doing like basic games like this like
I said you also will be able to do PowerPoint Office X
you can install
you know you can open big
Excel files on there
the 8 gig of memory should be plenty of performance
but you also be able to do things like video editing photo editing
so you can put the pen in like that
it was the best way we choose it with
the pen is use it as a tablet cause you can use it like that
let me just get the keyboard
put it into tablet mode all of that
I'm with word as well so we'll check that one thing
I did have some of the pen
that's just create a new page one thing
I'm a good drawer with the pen
but you could do if you wanted to
and there's no razor
that's the only thing that's missing
I think on here
you've got the pen you can
I do like taking notes on the surface with the pen so make sure the screen as well looking at that
this one's at 2160 by 1440 very nice
clear screen
we load something up and we can talk about that so they this group
this green is extremely clear and bright really vivid color reproduction
so let's do one thing
I really like about the screen
very sharp very clear with a good color
reproduction as you can see from there
so that's a definite post on this device
it turns it back your life
I've been finding well
I forget about five hours
various prices depending on the configurations
it's got the pen input
of course you've got the keyboard fly
well my short time with this device
I'd say it's a very nice
very businesslike device it really is very comparable to surface pro 4
maybe even the surface book because the keyboard feels a bit more substantial
the surface book is more of a laptop
I guess but I very much like this
tried some other tablets and this perhaps from the surface pro 4 is the best one
I've use the Dell XPS is a such a sort of Express 15 which is similar
but that's more of that again
I think works really well

what is up guys
it's Jared D tech venture
thanks for dropping by before we get into this review go ahead and hit that
okay so you probably love to draw and that's why you stumbled upon our video
we felt this product was worth our time
so is it worth yours
what if you can have both a high quality product at a affordable price point
that is the pitch that hue ion is trying to make
for graphic artists around the world and today we have the hue ion 1060 + graphics drawing tablet
so join us
let's find out together the hue
I intend 60-plus is a direct competitor to walk
however the real selling point here for
the tablet comes nicely packaged and comes with everything
you expect it to plus more okay
you ready for this
I miss anything while we did
say that the tablet is similar to the Intuos Pro M
it is important to note that it's slightly smaller and lighter than the end but in real world use
the side buttons can be physically pressed
don't get me wrong though
the pen doesn't feel poorly made by any means but feeling the ones made by
we never had any issues getting the job done
which is the most important factor at the end of the day
I would have to say that
Wacom has a bit of an edge here in terms of comfort especially for extended drying periods
another thing
we should mention
the pen comes with a separate charging cable which seems a bit cumbersome
it's not a microUSB cable
which would have made more sense
but it's a proprietary charging cable
that means you'll have to carry the tablet's cable along with the
we decided to jump straight to
Hyun's website to get the most up-to-date version of the driver setting up
I kind of wished that it came with stickers
I'm not really quite sure where those are mapped on the tablet itself
but you got to play around with it for a bit
the sheer amount of custom it brings is very welcoming jumping into the driver software
it was very accurate tracking our movements
we did notice a bit of a delay
whenever we sped our pen movements
it shouldn't be any issue for most people but we can see this being irritating to some artists
but it's very faint
I love is the ability to use this in a split-screen setup
we were hoping to answer
our answer is absolutely yes you can probably get a higher quality
Wacom tablet if you can afford it and while Hugh ions offering doesn't outshine its competitors
it's really hard to not justify getting this considering the price
let me put this from a perspective of a youtuber such as myself
are there better cameras / tablets out there absolutely as we progress with our channel
I can say with utmost confidence that the human tablet will be the same for any budding artist
Canadian on the Amazon store
it is at the very least three to four times cheaper than what
Wacom has to offer
well that's it for today guys
if you like this video go ahead and give us a thumbs up

it's been a pleasure guys
i'm jared the tech venture
don't forget when it comes to tech the tech ventures are there we got your back
this is a super mobile tech review
and today we're going to take a look at the Fujitsu stylistic and 532 tablet
this is their mm pretty much only
Android tablet available now cost five hundred fifty bucks so it's not really cheap but you know
display the usual 1280 by 800 resolution
Tegra 3 1.4 gigahertz
really thin very sturdy has some milspec tests it only weighs one point to three pounds
we're gonna look at it now the Fujita stylistic m 532 is available now this is the US version
it's priced at 549 dollars
which is certainly steep for a consumer tablet now
Fujitsu sells us both to companies and direct online to consumers
you can buy it right off their website if you want so you know
corporate pricing does tend to be higher but still
I'm a little bit concerned about the price on this guy compared to other tablets on the market
but that's that's how they're marketing it
we're not looking for cutting edge consumer resolutions here again
now in terms of thickness because those do tend to be you think of it
I guess you hear our volume controls as our microUSB port
it's a little door right here
it's where your micro
we have an empty slot
that would be for a SIM card
I imagine overseas where you can get a 3g version of this up top
we have the power button the headphone jack
microphone nothing on this side and as we take a look at the back soft touch black feels good
I'm sure to eventually get jellybean
but it doesn't have a now
this is as vanilla and implementation of Android is you could ever see
there are no customization
there's no extra widgets here
this is just straight pure
it's just the standard stuff that you get with
Android so for those of you
who really just want straight pure Android
well you certainly get it here our little control menus pretty much straight
if we go on the settings page you can see just basically your standard
Andrew do I hear nothing special
going on tablet feels quick enough
it shred it's a very light clean implementation
that's ballpark for a Tegra
3 tablet and on - -
it did very well
eleven thousand seven hundred and thirty six for SunSpider javascript test
it did 1869
that's pretty good
so again just what you would expect good performance there so in terms of performance
you're definitely good to go
the air also pleasant to use
because it's so darn thin
the very glossy a durable despite as Fujitsu points out is really very to lay upon
Android web browser
no chrome here yet
that switchover becomes official when we go to jelly bean
Android iOS 4.1
you can see the standard
Android keyboard here
what was our own website so you can see how that loads smooth enough page them in good works fine
then we'll check out a video see on that place okay
speakers are actually pretty good
you're not even a half volume pop
it on too close man works well and for video playback in viewing photos
yeah well test on 1080p video playback now one of our test movie trailers 1080p high profile
mpeg-4 1080p obviously is higher than the resolution of the display itself
but if you're going to use HDMI via the optional $70 doc and makes more sense
it plays just fine as the sound quality is pretty good too
it's not the loudest tablet on the market
but it's not harsh it's not tinny
it sounds natural camera
quality on the rear camera
distinctly better than average 8 megapixel camera takes sharp photos and good video 10
you can see we can go all the way up to 1080p for resolution here
here's our user interface
here's a photo that we took so definitely better than average camera for a tablet
now we're in debt triggered and we can see tegra3 effects going on here
notice the water
usually you don't get to actually see the water there
Oh Aaron is all over our faces
it's not a Tegra 3 effects in effect and the Fujitsu plays the game just fine
the tablet has a two cell lithium ion battery as usual for tablets
given how thin and light
the tablet is there's not a whole lot of room for battery inside so that's this
Fujitsu stylistic M 532 Android tablet available now 549 and for that price I
there's no office suite
there's nothing there about the very basic google essential apps
you're gonna have to download everything yourself so for folks who are kind of new to tablets
that kind of thing
I'm Lisa from mobile tech review
this is the fidgets ooh stylistic
M 532 don't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel
hey everybody this is
Dave al Tavella for hot hardware
comm here with the first
Nvidia graphics has two gig of ddr3 system memory and 32 and 64 gig internal storage variants
and that's it in terms of connectivity with the exception of the standard sink in charge port
this is a Seuss's patented super IPS plus display with 600 minutes of brightness again windows
let's take a look around a little bit and show you what it's made of all right so again here
that's Asus proprietary connector on the right side of the tablet volume rocker
right there
two-in-one headphone jack
you've got a micro
HDMI port right behind this little
a fairly sparse offering to be honest here
this is a standard chiclet style
netbook sized keyboard really cramped
here is your sink in charge port and another small pinhole for reset functionality
ACS logo comes up
and you'll notice that the tablet actually boots fairly quickly
it's a little bit faster than the average
windows user interfaces evolved and there's no question the
Metro user interface is very different
let's go ahead and go through those now
this is the Windows Metro
Start screen capacitive
touch button
down here will always get you back to that
it's a little
Windows Start button
that will always get you back to the
Start screen
Wi-Fi and battery level indicator over here
charms toolbar over here
you've got a Settings button you get devices
that's the charms
swipe in from the right now
multitasking is absolutely a huge strength for Windows 8 and Windows RT
let's go ahead and show you that
this is the
it now moves into a secondary portion of the screen
okay now we can bring this back
the toolbar brings up the keyboard
these days you've got pension zoom available
and what's more impressive as you can see right there
the tablet re-renders the image very quickly
okay once we get that orientation it actually renders the screen
this tablet the reason why
Windows 8 Windows
and so
and so we've got here in the standard desktop mode here with Windows
but they're not using a lot of resources
0% CPU 53% memory
they're in the background and asleep
that will come with a Windows
but here we've got things like spotlight apps from pops eye
Asus picks Netflix games
social media apps and as you can see entertainment photos music and video
lots of different things available here
we've gone ahead and installed a game app
that will go ahead and pull up
let's go ahead and show you
engine as you can see pretty darn good especially in the tablet device
Hydro Thunder hurricane and that is currently available for $9.99 on the Microsoft Store
look at the asus vivo
Tab RT Windows RT tablet
I'm Dave out Davila from hot hydro make sure you stop by our site for the full review
thanks for stopping by
sup folks today
I have something a little different for you guys
huion a drawing tablet company contacted me about reviewing their newest graphic tablet
hs6 one one for those
who don't know graphic tablets or pen
tablets are one of the most accessible ways to create digital art
this tablet is how large it is for comparison this is the Wacom Intuos tablet
i normally use
i would say it's about 8 by 12 inches
you'll notice this tablet comes with a ton of express keys too
I actually love the express keys on the pen a little more
I do use a lot
there are also adapters to connect your tablet to an Android which I do not have so
I cannot demonstrate that but I still think it's really really cool
I decided the best way to break in this new tab was to do a be more chilled inspired piece
it felt slightly more natural especially when I was using the pencil tools
it could just be that
I will say something that I didn't expect to love almost just as much as how it felt to draw with
the tablet was its color or their color that I chose the hs6
1:1 comes in three colors
Express keys that I ended up using a bit like a saving shortcut which is very convenient
a brush size adjustment shortcut and zooming in and out of the canvas one thing
this tablet has everything that you could ever need to successfully create beautiful digital art
everyone stays safe and I hope you're doing well
greetings everyone Eric
here and welcome back to another video in this one
this is a standard drawing tablet meaning
this is currently 50 dollars
they're very nice
they've got a nice nice
click enos to them which is really nice
this does nothing
this is just a color it does come in four different colors
I have the page up here so I can see here comes in the red which is what I have
it comes in kind of a grayish color a gold color and a blue color
so it's pretty nice that you comes with different colors now
I'm I actually did
do a tried to do an unboxing of this but that didn't go too well for me
the footage just
I didn't like the footage but I'll I have all the things here
so obviously you get the tablet
the next thing you get from bike normally
is this pen
it comes with this weird material
I don't know what this material is in this carrying case
I don't know if it's like suede or something
I don't know what this material is
but it's nice little carrying bags very light
you get the pen itself which is completely battery free
it doesn't require any charging or anything like that
it has two buttons on it which is really nice the the only thing
I would say negative about this is I wish it came with like a rubber grip
these days are going to type-c connectors just because they're so convenient they can do a lot
it's really nice
obviously with every tablet you get you get a little glove from
it's that same kind of glove materially
it's nice kind of a soft fiber
Eskom aterial it's very elastic
it's fine the other things you get
is you get the Quick Start Guide in this little baggie
I don't know why it comes in a little baggie
all you gotta do is go to the website
download the zip file of the latest drivers
then all you got to do is just quickly
the mapping for what part of the screen that's gonna control the functions
what keyboard shortcuts
you're using so this is great brief
you want to have it so that any time you open a Photoshop
Adobe Premiere or movie studio or DaVinci Resolve
it's a different set for each one of those
so that's really handy here a lot of times those
CDs are reused or they're very old they don't print new drivers on those CDs
I've already used this tablet
now if you follow me or you subscribe to me you'll notice that
don't get along rail because it's been so long since
I've used them I pretty much
100% switched over to display tablets
in fact the draw
I was able to sketch really easy
the surface is super smooth
I draw with it but my impressions of this tablet are very good very positive
it's a very good tablet for 50 bucks for the fact you get to 12 keys the USB type-c connector
it's a 10 by 6 inch work area which is really nice
it's just a really good tablet so if final thoughts are I really like this tablet for 50 bucks
you really can't beat this kind of quality you get the 12 buttons
it's a 10 by 6 area
the surface is super smooth
the pen is you know battery free
really hit it out of the park with this one again
thank you guys so much for watching this video
if you enjoyed the video give it that thumbs up subscribe for more videos
leave comments below if you have this tablet
they've been very helpful for me with any questions
I've had make sure you leave a comment on anything
thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you guys in the next video later
hey everyone today
let's take a look at the things that I included
sure you need warranty service
it has a nice weight to it
which makes it feel very solid
it doesn't require battery to work two side buttons and that's the name in front
this is very nice to hold very well
I'll put some links in the video description below to where you can find this online
I like to look and design aesthetics
I'm seeing here
the drawing area is about ten by six inches and the surface
it's matte which is really nice to draw on it
has that almost paper like you
it's very thin on the back
the finishing
it's very nice the patterns
they have firm feedback
the control wheel provides very nice feedback
when you're turning it the overall look and feel it's very professional
alright let me show you what the driver can do
this is the driver on
you can set mouse functions if you are using extended monitors or dual monitors
you can choose this option here to switch a screen
there is this option to enable
so if you want to use that tablet as a big trackpad you can do so by turning that on
I'm not sure what keen mode is
this is the work area by default
the whole drawing area has been mapped onto the whole desktop
go to the right
sorry that's the battery
the tablet can still be used for drawing so no worries
there has tested drawing performance so pressure sensitivity works really well the pen
it's very responsive very sensitive and there is no lag at all the initial activation force
it's very light so you can draw really light without pressure to get those thin lines very easily
let's take a look at the pressure transition
it's very precise very accurate
overall drawing of four lines here with MIDI Bank paint Pro
it's also very smooth this is Krita pressure sensitivity
works here as well
I'm drawing with my mouse like what I'm doing right now
I'm drawing the trackpad on my laptop
there is also input pad and now
I'm using a toothbrush
pay attention to the shape of the cursor right now
vertical tilt and pressure can work at the same time
and this is affinity photo pressure whoops here as well
that's a very typical for the shop
lag that happens with other tablets as well pen pressure seems to work fine
so that's great
let's see if device can taper nice
nice let's take a look at that transition from thin to thick
so that's quite smooth
and when the curves are turning it's also very smooth
let's draw a very faint pressure
in fact let me reduce the pen size so this is how pressure sensitivity works
and it's quite sensitive because the pen is sensitive so when a tissue
I have with
Photoshop is two input lag
but that really is a problem with photoshop
though the illustrator pressure works fine and this is very responsive
unlike photoshop this tablet can actually be used with android devices
I have tried this tablet this
we don't have that where this phone where my other
it only works with this phone
I'm not sure why
it's it to support cute
I mean the this app that I'm using welcomed
bamboo paper is said to support tilt but somehow
they all don't work because there is no driver
you can customize the shortcuts you can definitely draw on
it crashed and it lost connections
so let me try and reconnect this and see if I can get the connection again
it's not working
so sometimes for me to get a wireless connection to work
I have to connect the cable to the adapter to get it to get a phone to recognize the tablet first
so now you see the cursor there and disconnect this to connect a wireless receiver
I hope that it can be recognized and it does work now
alright to conclude the design looks really nice
I really like it
it's very beautiful
this tablet definitely gets a 5 out of 5 stars from me
that's really due to the optimization of cretan
Photoshop with MIDI band paint Pro and clip studio paint the drawing performance
the transition is very smooth when it comes to drawing curves corners the curves the very smooth
I have not tested this on Mac OS so for any updates on its one performance with Mac OS
you would have to check out a tax review
is their phone tablet or something else
sometimes the mapping is not done
I'm not sure if I can recommend that this for me
it didn't work well with my android phone
I recommend using this tablet with desktop
Trung software rather than with Android so overall
it's a good product you can check out the pricing on my own website
link will be in the video description below and thanks for watching this review
I hope it's helpful
see you in the next video bye
could it be a useful tablet with that
I mange for my next table calm and in this
Lenovo tap is seven review
you will find out whether that is true or not
by the way lenovo has been releasing cheap 7-inch tablets regularly in the last couple of years
some are still available among its predecessors are the Lenovo Tab 3 7 and Lenovo Tab 7 essential
I reviewed all of them and you can find videos about them on this channel
this review is about the newest
Lenovo Tab E 7 as you might expect at this price point really no vote
it is where we thick and weighs 272 grams on the right side
we get a power button and the volume controls
there's a microphone on the bottom and on the left side we get a micro
the tap e7 has a 1 single speaker which is located above the screen
its sound quality is kind of acceptable to watch some YouTube
I've got some other things to say about the cameras
we get a 0.3 megapixel front-facing camera and the 2 megapixel main camera
we really can't expect good cameras
if you own an almost 7 inch smartphone that one will have a much higher pixel density but actually
some we theater applied onto the screen
it really should be a bit better
MT 8167 quad-core processor
again we have to keep its low price and mind and as you might expect
it is important to note that the Amazon fire HD 8 gets a noticeably
better score and cost us $30 more
well those are benchmarks at this price
it is important that standard epsilon smooth enough and actually that is the case here
I think we can thank Android
that wasn't the case with the lenovo
TF 7 essential let one worship to a standard Android instead of Android go
it is also important to know that this is not a multitasking tablet
apps get closed fast in the background and if you use
Chrome with a lot of open tabs
some of them might have to reload if you switch between them
I think that dude is a small RAM
there's another thing
I noticed was chrome
sometimes it can take about a second and their text is too loaded properly and look sharp
that only happens when switching from another app or the home screen to Chrome
it's probably another issue with this small
Ram and no the tap is 7 is not a perfect gaming tablet
either you won't be able to play pop
the graphic self to be set to its lower obviously but because of the bed screen
I think it is usable
the lenovo tabby seven ships with Android 8.1
oh we're goin
I don't think it will ever get em at 9 lenovo
did release updates at fixed bucks and so already though I quite like Android go on GT p7
at first glance you don't notice that it is a simpler version of Android compared to standard ones
there are some minor differences only for example the backbone of the app drawer has a solid color
usually it is transparent with the wallpaper shining through
it is also missing a split screen view so you cannot open through app side by side
the operating system runs smoothly and I like it quite a bit
I did notice one negative thing about N word go or at least the Google keyboard
it seems like at least the keyboard things that this is a smartphone
the keyboard is smaller than it should be on 7 inches
Lenovo type e 10
we kind of get vanilla and word here and that is great there are a couple of apps pre-installed
only two of those are games that you can uninstall easily one reason why most
Epsilon smoothly on here might be the Google go apps for example instead of standard
so it's a simpler versions that one well on here the only go apples a huge design differences
YouTube go the design is much simpler than what we get less than at YouTube
I aimed at markets was bad internet as well a couple of words about Netflix
you can watch movies with us tablet without any issues however you cannot watch
Netflix in HD synthesis not NHD Ted
that anyway said is not a big deer in this case inside
Tilly no vote
it does not lose much energy while in standby
alright that's the end of my
Lenovo tapi 7 review and I've got to get to my final words
that is not that easy because it is very cheap
I like that
all of that runs smooth enough especially when you're not a power user
I think that is important
even though it is cheap it should be at least usable and that is the case here
I also like Android go in psycho apps most other aspects are not that good though
the battery life is very short
you cannot take out photos with the cameras and the speakers are acceptable at most
Lenovo should have used an IPS screen
here well the tap is 7 is very cheap and it's just $50 you cannot expect high-end hardware again
however if you can spend around $30 more you will be able to get a much better device
let's take a look at a couple of alternatives
a direct competitor with a similar price is the Amazon fire
7 the fire 7 and Lenovo type II 7 have almost identical hardware
there are minor differences on
it is fine for simple tasks to among its few differences as amazon's version of Android
that is running a heavy
UI and no Google apps are pre-installed with Lenovo
we almost get vanilla Android
it's only downside
is the software again we often saw
Google Apps manually but I think the value is much better here
you might not get any local volunteers
alright that's my
Lenovo tap East 7 review
if you have any questions please write me down below and subscribe to this channel
i'm andrea for my next approach calm and I review pretty much
every tablet that is released almost worldwide
thanks a lot for watching
hey guys love and peace toons here and today
I will be reviewing the V
the accessories are all great
so that's nice
the pen itself is a bit thicker than the one and
I'm used to but it feels really solid and comfortable holding it
there's a smudge guard glove that fits nicely the cable is a 1 meter
the tablet has 12 buttons on the side and 2 on the pen so far it feels nice when
I'm handling it so let's get this plugged and see how it performs alright
editing we are back with the drivers already installed loading up their configuration app
you can see your tablets model in the top left corner
also there are four options on the
Left pane mapping function and about us
you can also test your pressure sensitivity here as you can see
I'm playing around with the sensitivity here
I'm pressing down harder and softer on the tablet
and you can see the pressure being indicated on the bar
of course you can see it all working just fine
this is very handy as
I'm running a dual monitor setup when I was testing it
the transition was smooth
there was no need to restart or anything
I've already tried that
and it was mapping all right so
and it's very simple so easy to use and now back to the hardware
the tablet has a drawing area of 10 by 6 inches or that is 25.4 by 15 point 24 centimeters
I'm seeing something like that
being offered anywhere and speaking of design
I think it is aesthetically pleasing
I've already made one drawing with it and it was not that much of a problem for me
buttons feel like well buttons
I assume considering the fact that it comes with 20 replacement nibs
the smudge guard
they all seem to be working
just fine at the time of recording this
the buttons have not been customized
so you can see that
their default functions are also working fine
I decided to test out the pen
I got some base colors in and started blending them all together
the buttons do their job well
I can easily see myself putting down the function there that I would use more often
the mezzanine gets 5 out of 5
so there was a slight hiccup with the setup
and when downloading the drivers I found myself clicking the icon of the operating system
the product is more of the website issue for the accessories
I would have loved to have a pen stand with it so I'm gonna go with 4 out of 5
the device feels good
so max points here
I like the pen
and even though it's a bit too thick there are no batteries to weigh down
the material does not feel like very cheap plastic
the tablet is thick enough so it doesn't bend at all and value for money
oh man you're only paying 40 pounds for this
you get 14 buttons 60 inches of drawing surface 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity
plus it has more spare nibs that you would ever need and a smudge guard
I think it's a great beginner tablet
I'd go for that
I went on to do a drawing with it and this is what happens
I think it turn out alright
even though it's in a really weird style the tablet did help me a lot in the drawing here
if you found this useful you could consider drawing a like in there so that
my opinion is based on my previous tablet experience and I would definitely say that
this is a major upgrade
and it's a nice little upgrade that
in order to celebrate the 1000 subscribers let me know in the comments below
I'd love to hear your suggestions and yes I do read all of them
shout out to the people that made this amazing fan art on my discord server
hey there everyone
this is the Signature Edition meaning that it doesn't have any blower on it
I got it for 110 now
it is listed for $88 on Amazon and still goes for $99 on the Microsoft Store
I will leave both links below in the description so you can go ahead and check it out
they put quite a lot of effort on the package
and the back you'll see more in-depth specification and there's only one color in that silver
the tablet is composed of a thin sheet of aluminum
the folds over with the subtle curves on to the display
the tablet weighs 308 point 44 grams
my scale read 307
so it's just a bit off which is equivalent to point 68 pounds
the microphone is placed at the bottom right side of the tablet
it has been recognizing my voice for 80% of the time hey
Cortana what's up it's - maple Saturday
the specification is pre beast
that gets it up to one point
eighty three gigahertz
gigs of free internal memory
gigabytes and the tablet reads it just fine
this is good for storing documents photos and a few videos to watch on the go
the side vessels are small
I don't think so
Wi-Fi still works with airplane mode enabled
this also allows for you to connect the mouse to it for more precise control or a keyboard
if you want to go wireless you can use a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse on it
the tablet has bluetooth 4.0
so it won't decrease your battery that much the Wi-Fi ban on this is only a 2.4
gigahertz ban where this tablet falls short is in the sound
the sound on this is not that great when
I pump the sound all the way up
there's a bit of cracking
it is more suitable in a room where there's not much noise going on
a pair speakers really helps a lot
another thing to know
is that because of how thin this tablet is it is a bit slippery and to me
it feels a bit uncomfortable to hold for a very long time
also due to its thinness
the tablet is very fragile and any drops will damage the soft aluminum body
and it's pretty useful
another thing that may be a downfall is that the tablet doesn't get that
I have it here
if you want this specifically for gaming you are better off saving your money and investing it
maybe in a higher-end tablet you can still play less intensive games on this you can run
Windows version of Minecraft with subtle lag
every now and then
Al's for racing game works great on it which I'm playing right now
the tablet has an accelerometer gyroscope and GPS
it is not easy to play with my arms wrapped around the tripod so
I'm kind of sucking a bit right now
modern combat 5 runs officially on it
I'm not big gamers so I don't spend hours gaming on it
it does get a bit warm after a while using it
Microsoft Office smoothly
I have Word Excel publisher powerpoint and onenote on it
just around the corner
I think the a inch display is an ideal size this is easy to carry around and runs efficiently
I'm browsing the web watching youtube videos and doing some light multitasking
so this is almost an unbelievable bargain
so that concludes my experience with the new vision
what's happenin panda
Nation Peter Brown
Panda you know that
I'm a fan of these Amazon
fire tablets a good value but I also just picked up this and what
I'm really excited about
is this matrix pad a z4 is an Android tablet
it is a 10-inch or I don't know if it says it on the box here
I'm going to open this sucker up ten inch or two gig ram and 32 gigs of storage
it's by Van
Keogh is you don't have to worry about bloatware and stuff like that as much as you know the
Amazon ecosystem is locked down
they put ads and stuff like that
they don't have the Google Play Store
the film remove threw them on the back of the camera
press a little button power button
alright so hopefully this is all pretty straightforward now
I will say it
looks like a pretty nice tablet and in fact
it's a little shorter but it's a little taller as well right so
I get a little bit more of a TV screen look
here's the Amazon
one this is a little like widescreen
you shouldn't expect like premium
you know
aluminum construction looks like we have the speakers on the back here
the camera right up there looks like there's even a flash
let's just kind of impressive
headphone jack right there
SD card slot
that's really why
I got this because I can throw in a bunch of movies onto a very large SD card
throw it in here on any of my
Android tablets watch them you know and and not be device constrained like I am on iPads microUSB
I'm not sure if that's a light or home port there it is
I can go powered by Android powering up and then so all
the switches are on the top portion
I just want to take a look inside the box
see what else would get so
we get guide here
I will say I do like how light it is in my hand
you know vibrating
and that's partially because little plastic and now how loud it's playing
compared to the fire tablet otay constructionwise
this might feel a little bit
oh maybe I don't know a little more solid me me but heavier
and so that's the trade-off and so you can see right here like
I said I mean you can decide right
do you want that wider or screen or though the largest thing
I think that the responsiveness is maybe just a little bit snappier here on the Amazon
fire tablet now
that is something you don't really have to sweat right
you can take it on trips
put it through its paces
let your kids use it
whatever so you want to pick up this matrix pad z4
I will put a link to in the description below Peter

welcome to Greg Iles
this is a review for the dragon
touch k10 10.1
inch tablet now
it is a 720p display
so it's 1280 by 800 so slightly over 720p display
I caught a 720p
HDMI port
see at this point so you'll still have to use that the other parts
this is just what it looks like on the back here
you get a camera as well at the top there
gigahertz no 5 gigahertz
in this you will get bluetooth 4.0 you get a headphone jack
so if you want to plug in some headphones it's like
I've never seen a headphone jack
so close to the end of the tablet
it's all the way up there and then other than that
yeah let's get into the review of this tablet so first off
let's talk about the display
it's gonna be what you see on this display and it stands out right at you
it's pretty good
I mean for a 720p plus display
not that bad the viewing angles are pretty good as you can see
they're not the best but they're not the worst
it's it's just the video that I'm recording at
it's not washed out at all
it's pretty the colors are actually pretty down and darn good on this
the clarity is pretty good
even though it's only 720p videos you can only choose to play them at 7
P in this YouTube app
you can't make them play higher than 720p
the sound is pretty bad
I said the sound is pretty darn bad and I'll play a song real quick here
it's not that bad
it's a under $100 tablet it's literally 95 bucks right now on Amazon
and just getting the tablet to roam around the operating system and things like that
it does a fairly good job at that
you know just loading up a video to play
it's gonna do that fairly quick
there you go
this is gonna be an ad but just jumping around if you want to use it for some browsing
obviously it'll do that because it's a tablet from Android and it does a pretty good job
it's again not too bad for what it does under 100 bucks as you
obviously it can do all that so you can view your Instagram stories or just use Instagram overall
I mean I wouldn't go crazy and play pub G or fortnight but you know games like this
you know most of the games
I think people play our game like this
that this tablet will easily handle and in literally a hard bucks
you can have a small little gaming tablet
that does absolutely fine next
it's nothing to write home about there's one I took with the front camera
they're both 2 megapixels on the front and the back again they're nothing crazy
good you can see
there's a slight
if you're just you doing you know videos and really nothing else
listen to music
maybe play some games so you know
so when you go in here you're gonna have access to all of the features that Android 8.1
Android experience on here and there's no blow Ware on here when I came on
this doesn't have it so at that point
I'll reiterate who this tablet's for it's for kids
it's for someone that wants a secondary tablet
see you guys down the road purse
if you watch my channel you know
I'm a huge fan of the surface pro
six in fact it was my favorite tune one of 2018 and
hey everybody its Andrew and this is my unboxing and review of the Lenovo ThinkPad x1 tablet 3rd
gen coming up wanna see more videos like this
well why not hit that
subscribe button and make sure you hit that notification icon
this way you'll be alerted every time
here's a quick rundown of the specs
what you're looking at is a 13-inch 3k IPS
LCD display
it's absolutely gorgeous
it's powered by the Intel 8th generation cable 8 processor either the Core
i5 or the core i7
you can configure it
up to one
terabyte of SSD storage and up to 16 gigabytes of ddr3
RAM it comes with a micro SD card slot and an optional
LTE which I recommend but enough with the specs
let's find out what you get inside the box
let's open it up now
and you also get your keyboard cover
you get the ThinkPad pen
Pro at no additional cost it uses the Wacom AES technology 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity
runs off one quadruple a battery
they give you the plastic pen holder as well
we'll get to that in a little bit
but it's good to see they throw that pen in the Box
you get your extension cord and your 65 watt power adapter which uses USB type-c now
the keyboard cover is really nice
it uses a smooth finish as opposed to the Alcantara
it's really excellent now
it has strong sturdy metal hinges
LTE SIM slot as well as a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack on the other side
you get your power button as well as your volume rocker up and down now as far as those
I want to thank today's sponsor
today's video is brought to you by lvl
go you one-stop-shop for Windows
ok so check this out
Microsoft Office $31.50

Microsoft Office no problem fifty
seven dollars
sixty-four cents becomes forty five dollars
fifty four cents after my twenty one percent discount code that's incredible want the 2016
Microsoft Office
it's a little bit cheaper thirty-nine eighty-nine becomes 35 ninety
I have a special 10% discount code for that and that's another great savings right
there watering is easy and safe head on over to lvl
the star of the show is it's gorgeous 13 inch IPS
LCD display absolutely gorgeous
it's a 3k display
that's a three thousand by two thousand resolution
it's a multi-touch display
it's really responsive
you also getting a three by two aspect ratio
that's my favorite aspect ratio
and it's a very bright display coming in at 415
it's certainly above the category average and one of the best in this category
it's great for both indoor and outdoor use
that's fantastic
the blacks are very deep
the colors are really vibrant and just seem to pop off the display
one you can look at now you will notice the side bezels as well as the top and bottom chin
that's because this will be used as a tablet
the pen itself has 4096 levels of pressure
I didn't lose the pen and it stayed in
its silo the whole time now
excellent key travel with the touchpad and of course that great rack point which
I think they did a fantastic job with it now
you're probably wondering by now
well how's the performance
actually come glad you asked
it's really good now
these are quad core processors
each gen now
of course it also depends on whether you're gonna get it with 8 or 16 gigabytes of RAM the more
ram the better
that's not what this is for so just bear that in mind now as far as thermals are concerned
which is it really good especially when you compare to its chief competitor
the surface pro six
they do supply
a 65 watt power adapter in the box so this is the front-facing camera on the ThinkPad x1 third gen
it's actually pretty good eye for considering this is a two and wanna
I want to know what you think
let me know now
this is a 1080p 30 frames per second and it's good for Skype
it's good for video conferencing but again let me know what you think about it
I am curious to know although it's not a Windows hello camera keep that in mind now
the rear facing camera is actually pretty good considering
this is a tablet and the video as you can see here wasn't too bad
I was actually pleasantly surprised with it
I think they actually did a pretty good job
I'm curious to know what you think
let me know now you do get a fingerprint scanner
it's on the right side
they just don't get loud enough
this didn't give me a rich sound
that didn't get loud enough as I stated and I just wasn't impressed now
the good news is you do get a 3.5
millimeter headset jack
this is a very portable device
this is actually a pretty good package so to wrap things up can
I recommend the Lenovo ThinkPad x1 tablet 3rd gen and the answers
absolutely this is an excellent two-in-one
I love its gorgeous design
it's bright vivid
3k display excellent keyboard
of course
it's not perfect
I'm not crazy about its battery life
it won't last all day
there are no real deal-breakers unless you consider the battery life a deal-breaker
I'm gonna give this a score of 89% making the x1 tablet worth your money
so what do you think about the lenovo
thinkpad x1 tablet 3rd gen
I absolutely love it
this is built like a tank
the design is excellent
the display is really gorgeous
it's a 3k display no complaints on that front
I love the fact they give you the pen and the keyboard in the box and speaking of keyboards
it's got that excellent keyboard we've come to love with the ThinkPad line
this is no exception
they're actually pretty weak so
performance was very good out of its eighth generation
KB Lake processor although I would love a refresh with the whiskey Lake processor
although this did very well obviously as you can see from those results we showed in the video
this is built like a tank
it's got that mill
stand there great on it so it's been put through 12 different tests to show its endure
the rock solid build quality and the overall great looks
now speaking of the looks it is a major fingerprint magnet
let me know in the comment section below so please hit the like button please subscribe
please share this video
don't forget to leave a comment in that comment section below
let me know how
I'm doing let me know if there's a device or something out there you think I should review
I'll do my best to try to make that happen
don't forget to check me out on
Facebook on Twitter Instagram and of course my website AMD Tech reviews.com
so until next time this is andrew from AMD tech see ya
we are doing a review on a tablet
this little baby here
and this is the series h6 of what it says on the amazon website
and also i've never seen this before as well
this is a first for me
it's google gms certified
i had to read up on it because i thought what does that mean
so basically
google prioritized test suites
which test the compatibility of google apps with the android device this baby
so it's been tested by google
so hopefully it should be safe so we're going to have a quick look around the box
there's a tablet pc on the side and shows you what it can do play music play video play games
you can read on it take photos and do some painting
is that painting not sure could be
so that's about it there you go ips
google likes they've been tested by google
this is the gb version
great brain it has a 5 000 milliamp battery and it has type c connection
well very nice warranty card
what's that so activate your warranty visit blah blah blah
i will read that later
move that away
peel this off
shall we not on very well
was it got reset
it looks like on off button now
plus a minus headphones not sure what that is and connections
okay so it takes a headphone socket
which is good should have done that
slow shouldn't i
so this is it
i wasn't expecting that added bonus
well i look right don't i
yeah very nice
and what's this looks like a screen protector
i would say that was the screen protector
that is the screen protector in there
that's very good
i like that
i'm not going to use it yet
but that is very good and the manual
this is a quick guide
normally you'd like to see what all the connections are normally
i didn't mention which is cameras so front camera rear camera as you can see
we're going to see how easy it is to start up so basically you turn it on for three seconds
i believe let go and there
she goes so that was an opposite
that should just go dark
how'd you get out of that
so that's quite a nice little feature
google play protect
yeah we know about that
don't worry so what else is up here your settings
so here's all your settings battery 96
yeah it's almost fully charged
get rid of that
let's see if there's anything else on it
so everything is there so you have a clock you drive which is external
drive your files google
bits some quick look assistant gallery blah blah blah
usual stuff play store
i'll have a quick look at that freaky
oh it's a free gift
have a quick look
welcome to chrome i use earlier
so we've got set up a chrome account
turn on no thanks
we're just going to test it out for now
see how good she is no internet
so we've got to sort out the internet
i will do that right now
and i will be guessing you need to go in here network blah blah blah
wi-fi is off
click on this again and we should get something
join the free vip blah blah blah
i'm not going to do anything like that
i just want to see what does are you sure you want to close
i'm sure want a free gift
there you go
so that's what that does so
let's see if we can install the game and see how easy it is to work
so we've got kindle in there
i didn't notice that earlier
there's a little bit of lag there but you've got to understand
this is not expensive
of course we don't care right so we'll do my stream deck
let's turn it and take a photo
oh okay that was okay
have a look yes
i've got a lot of light going on at the moment for the video so i need to find something
it's going to give me a natural light
and how'd you play
i see press play so you've got to bear in mind
this is never going to be a fantastic picture quality but is it good enough
i'm going to delete that
i don't need that no more delete
that is a photo i believe so i took a photo
so look a bit wishy-washy but like i said you can't expect it'll be fantastic keyboard video
it's not bad though
i'll give it that
take her outside right
so what do i think then for the amount of money you pay 83 pound a man that sort of price
i thought it was pretty good
wasn't expecting it'd be fantastic picture quality on video and camera
i thought was it was
the quality of the videos from youtube are excellent or any films
they are very good nice and clear as you can see in my video
this might be the baby for you
i think like i said for the amount of money you pay
i think it's well worth that kind of money
definitely get my thumbs up on this and hopefully you like it
let me know in the comments
what you think about it i think like i said for 83 pound
i think it's well worth that kind of money
that that you can upgrade the memory to up to 128 gigabytes
it comes with a usb charger as a headphone socket
i think it's well worth the money so with that what i will do
if you didn't give us a thumbs down and please subscribe it's free
it doesn't cost you any money
thank you very much for watching me you
what's going on guys the CTA praten back here again today
we're gonna be taking a look at lenovo's newest affordable 7-inch budget tablet the tap m7
we're gonna be taking a look at and testing out the new tab m7
this is a $60 tablet offered by
Lenovo and I'm actually having a hard time on understanding why and who this is made for
I know that the holidays are coming up and the only thing I can think is
I wish we could get something like this with a higher end chip like even the Snapdragon 820 now
I know that chips getting old but it still performs pretty well with the stuff that I want to do
we have our volume rocker
power switch and our 2 megapixel rear camera over on the left hand side
I really do
love the form factor of this tablet
and when we put it up against the 2019
Amazon fire 7
the m7 definitely comes ahead in the form factor
Department it's got much smaller bezels
and the back is fully constructed of aluminum
but what about the internal specs
now that's what we're gonna go over now for a $60 tablet
gigahertz media tech Mt MP to one gigabyte of lpddr3 Ram a 7 inch IPS
good up to one terabyte
unfortunately they did not add
Go Edition and that's actually one of the best things that's got going for it now
even though this is running
Android go an extra gig or even a half
a gig would have helped out tremendously so overall this device is still pretty close to stock
Android we do have the Google Play Store right out of the box
this is a very low-power chip in here and a lot of the games aren't gonna run at full speed
even some of the lower end ones now
gigahertz Network because we can't pick up that 5 gigahertz but loading everything
up does take a little bit of time
this thing doesn't get that loud
it is pretty clear for what it is though so like
I said Netflix is a very well
optimized app and it actually loads up a lot faster than most of the other apps that
I've tested especially Disney
Wi-Fi chip that they chose to use in this unit
keep in mind this is Geekbench four and not Geekbench five
I've been using Geekbench four for a long time so I kind of wanted to keep it
simple here single-core
the fire
seven actually comes ahead in single and multi and the fire
seven is a very low-end tablet to begin with so as for the Wi-Fi speeds
they're not as terrible as I thought but they could be much better if they had it built an AC chip
I'm only about 12 feet from the router itself on a 2.4 gigahertz network download 41.7
megabits per second upload 22.8
so to wrap this up
I wanted to test out some native Android gaming pub G call of duty
I did have to set everything to medium but the game is fully playable on this
even minecraft was a bit slow on this tablet and by the way
and there's lots of stutters going on
this is only the very beginning of the game as you build your farm up
there'll be more assets on screen and the lag will get worse
emulation using the drastic emulator
we're getting a hundred percent speed-up in the top left hand corner
I do have the FPS listed and it seems to be running fairly well on the m7 and for my final test
I wanted to get some emulation out of the way I went with Playstation one now SNES Sega Genesis
I figured I'd go ahead and test out ps1 now
m7 isn't the best performer
now with video playback it works pretty well but you gotta wait for that loading some lower end
emulation will work but even the lower in native android games that i tested are a bit laggy
so it's definitely not made for gaming and it's really hard for me to recommend this to anybody
see tab s6 but it's a really expensive unit
in my opinion it is the best
Android tablet ever created
but it's got a really really high price tag now in the next coming days
this is the same
CPU I tested in a cheaper Android smartphone recently and performance was actually decent
we should be able to do
call a duty pop
G minecraft at full speed and not to mention emulation PSP Dreamcast PlayStation
they're gonna be on sale for
I really appreciate you watching if you have any questions
thanks for watching you
now here is something new again
now this is um a pebble gear
seven inch kids tablet
i would say so definitely now
this comes with the tablet itself
you get the uh
the bumper case charger basic manual
and this is what it's for it's a android 1.3 gigahertz chip only 16 gigabytes of storage is wi-fi
it's virtually exactly the same thing now
it does say here
this is one year of amazing free content but nowhere when you set up the device
does it ask for credit card details debit card details or any details whatsoever
so i'm not quite sure what happens after one year
do you have to resubscribe
uh do you have to pay like a small fee
i don't know we'll soon find that
find out after one year now
this is the tablet itself seven inches on the back
nice frozen two
there's the camera and that's the speaker you turn it on on the side
there's also the rocker and down
here is a storage bay so you can chuck in more ram if you wanted to
so let's turn it on voila so you're greeted too a wallpaper
a nice wallpaper can be changed
you swipe it up
now i've already created elias's account my little boys account now over here
you have a printer account you press it
ask for a password
i'm going to turn away or enter the password
there we go so i'm in now with this
you can really change everything
so this first page is what we call stats
it's the usage of the actual device
of course
my boy hasn't really been playing that much
the best thing about this is actually
you can actually see what they have been doing
this is my little boys screen very simple again
you can change the wallpaper
the store is there so let's log into the store
it's called the game store and in here
we select categories and again learn books media now
media is always empty
so i'm guessing you've got to put your own media on there reading books loads and loads
they're missing oh there's only five but when you click on them
each one of these contain a number of books for definite so you see

they can cost a pretty penny and we have
we do know a lot of kids

and things like that so getting in one of these it would have the games on them
no adverts nothing you can completely protect your child
i hope you enjoy that and i hope you buy one of these
thanks for watching
pioneer finally released this 9-inch tablet and it's pretty cool
you can actually take it everywhere you go and it's pretty
i was just joking
this is the pioneer wt 7600 nex
and it's a floating screen digital receiver
one a big screen experience in an older vehicle with its price tag of a thousand us dollars
it's nice to see a usb c port and mini hdmi
probably already wondering if you can hide the hardness behind the screen
yes that's possible
now it's time to start our stopwatch for the boot time
everyone has 7 seconds in their life to wait for this unit to boot up
you need to install car av assistant app on your phone
this is pretty cool but for some of those features you have to have i datalink maestro
installed parking assist sensors swiping down on the home screen
you can access the suggestion pages
i was expecting to be a little bit more responsive
but if you don't mind that then it's perfectly fine
now it's time to do a quick walkthrough to the settings and see what's new here
pioneer is the best in class for doing so
tones and the colors will be reflected
this is one of my favorite features
you can even change the clock font
that's interesting because not even the iphones
i really like how they did
the graphic design because makes it very easy to understand
what's going on and take for example time alignment
they did it pretty well
and very easy to set the values and everything very intuitive switching to the video setup
please let me know in the comments and in the communication settings screen
we have a bunch of basic connectivity options
such as bluetooth and wi-fi one thing
i forgot to mention this unit offers
wireless apple carplay and android auto which is pretty pretty good
so that's it for this video
i hope you find it helpful and if you are interested in this kind of content
don't forget to subscribe
it doesn't cost you anything and it's always free
hey how's it going everyone
i'm nathan with the ebookreader.com for this video
i'm going to give you guys an in-depth review of the remarkable paper tablet 2.
so i reviewed the first one back in 2017.
it's nice to see they've updated the design quite a bit
it's much thinner and it just feels like a more premium device
it's got an aluminum frame and it's very thin
it comes with a stylus for writing on the screen
actually there are two different options for the stylus
there's a white one and a black one
they're mostly the same
they have the same kind of feel to them
so the remarkable is designed as a note-taking and writing device
the latency is virtually non-existent
it's 21 milliseconds
uh so here's kind of a look at the different
so i'll get more into that later
so the stylus
it's a magnetic stylus it'll stick to the edge of the device uh and then on the back
uh sports epub pdf files
uh you can have like your main view of listed files right here
you can send files as well a required internet connection
the remarkable has wi-fi for transferring files
but it doesn't have like a web browser anything like that
you've got to use the remarkable app
they have them for mobile devices
go through the remarkable account so it does require remarkable count
they have a conversion feature which i'll show a little bit later so up here you got the zooming
uh so in just a different style like the pencil actually looks like a pencil writing
so let's go ahead and load up just the regular pencil so it supports
this uh straight liner
it's just basically one solid level
you've got the undo option right here
you can do undo redo
you've got three different colors obviously the white
so here's kind of a look at a note if you don't have the greatest handwriting like i do
they have this conversion feature well
it'll convert your handwritten notes
uh into you know typed text so it does require an internet connection
uh but then you know it works pretty well
uh it's pretty accurate
it's more accurate than onyx's uh conversion feature
i was kind of messing around with some different things here
i set up a different test
you know it works pretty well some some things work better than others like the symbols
um it doesn't really recognize certain symbols but like these ones seem to work pretty well
like doesn't get backslash
so let's talk about the interface a little bit more again
we've got the different sections
you have your sections for your notebooks
you got your section for favorites
you've got all your quick links along
the top to add new folders new notebooks new quick sheets
let's go over into the settings menu
i'll show you a couple of different things in here
so that's where the wi-fi comes in
it's a beta feature
you can set a passcode to turn the device on and on for added security
it does support a number of languages for that handwritten conversion feature uh
it has three per row all right
uh you can
you can write notes on ebooks as well
ebooks and pdfs
you can still use all of your writing functions and it has the highlighter as well
so you got like the freehand highlighting here
so it's a little bit different than your you know
it's a little bit more basic but you got to understand
you know with a big screen like this and you've got a few options for your fonts
it doesn't have any like inverted mode or anything like that
so one thing worth mentioning
is this ebook
we're looking at right now
it's actually a wikipedia article
they have a google chrome extension
where you can send web articles to the remarkable to read them reformatted
it doesn't seem to work quite as well but it is an option
you've also got the search
you do have like different
cropping and zooming modes
i would like them to have a contrast darken feature
but it doesn't because as you can see here
the text is a little bit light
some devices have a way to darken
the text automatically
and that is kind of nice
but the responsiveness is pretty good
you know it'll get a little bit bogged down when you're loading like this multiple thumbnail view
once you turn the page so once you turn the page it'll reset back to regular view
so here's just a listen to the sound difference
this is one thing
this is the older ipad though with the uh original apple pencil
i don't know how the newer one is and another advantage with the ink
of course
direct sunlight doesn't phase it at all ipad full brightness
you can't really even see anything
thank you guys for watching check out the ebookreader.com for more info bye
hey how's it going guys
I thought having a non IPS display wouldn't be a problem
I was wrong
this is one of the poorest screens
what makes it look bad
it's easier to look at the pixelated
strong to stay
well put and it's easy to take off too
you can also place an intent mode and tablet mode to suit your need
there wasn't much of a delay when typing except one backspacing
sometimes there's a capacitive touch pad on the bottom and it's okay
it may take some time getting used to at first
you can use two fingers to scroll up or down on a page
but there's no writer left
click on here the
microUSB and DC port to use either one to charge the tablet a mini HDMI
microphone and behind it
a reset button micro SD card slot and the 2 megapixel camera on the other end is the speaker
that's not so great
it's made of just plastic all around and it's pretty thick and heavy
the tablet is packed with mediatek 1.3 gigahertz quad-core processor
1 gig of ram a arm
Mally 450 MPEG pu and it's near stock android 6.0 marshmallow
the tablet runs smoothly when lightly browsing the web
and doing some other basic tasks
there wasn't much of a slowdown especially with 3d games
more graphic heavy games ended up being slow and shoppi
if that's not enough then you can store a microSD card and transfer some of your apps onto it
one of the best things about this tablet is its battery life
you can expect to get around 5 to 6 hours of on-screen time that lasted two days for me at school
size does matter and the keyboard is suitable for almost anyone for $100
I'll have links down in the description and as always thanks for watching you
hey everyone this is a review for the here on campus
GT 191 tablet
besides the important things you also get pen nibs and a screen cleaner
this is what the monitor looks like on my desk
the screen is big and has a variety of colors
the pen is comfortable to hold and easy to use
the buttons on
the pen are customizable
the holder isn't really a necessity but as I often lose my pen
it's handy to have a place to keep it so it's a nice addition to the tablet
you were also given extra pen nibs if your pen gets too stubby
the monitor has five buttons that being the power button the menu button and navigation buttons
the stand that comes with the table is not attached
you have to attach it yourself
it was easy to put together as you were given an allen key and screws it took about five minutes
loaded the g21 nine driver and not the gt1 nine one version two driver
it's important to check as that's why
I thought my monitor wasn't working after downloading a driver
it's easy to navigate
it's all pretty self-explanatory
the transition from drawing tablet to monitor was so smooth
I had no thoughts
drawing on the monitor is easy and really fun
it's nice to have such a big screen to zoom into details
that is so clear and so big
I've also used
Wakeham drivers depend
partial options are also a lot more self-explanatory and understandable in comparison to where
Chrome the problems
I can't carry around and start up work
which isn't a problem since
I expected but I can't alter alternate alternate our script okay
the problems are encountered which a few can be easily words around
this is a monitor and not a tablet
I can't carry around and stop work
which isn't a problem since that's expected
I can't alternate between the human monitor and my Wacom tablet as the drivers are incompatible
personally this will only be a problem when
I'm away from home
I don't use the Wacom tablet at home now
then getting a tablet and monitor from the same company would be wise another minor
problem is the fact that the pen doesn't recognize the on-screen keyboard that you can use on
Windows so if you're planning on using only using the monitor screen
it may be a problem if you want to type for improvements
I would add an eraser to the end of this pen
I think it'd be cool to have the pen connected
with the monitor
it also works well with paint tool sai and Photoshop
I've used it with non drawing software like Camtasia Studio Google
it runs like a computer with a pen
I haven't tried it with kids to do a pain but I'd see no reason why I wouldn't work with it
I want to thank you one for this opportunity for viewing that tablet
it's been an honor to use and review this tablet and
please consider it if you're in the market for a monitor so again thank you
I'm so glad I was given the chance to use this and to continue to make art
I hope you get to try this amazing product
thank you for watching you
what's the deal folks
welcome to device overdose
i am your host ty in today's episode
i will be revisiting the lg g pad 5 10.1 tablet
i'm going to give the device a proper overview
so let's kim and keep it moving into the video as usual
the tablet will cost you
299 green stamps but hold up buster me
you can slap the device onto your equipment payment plan and pay 1250 a month
let's keep it moving now
the lg g-pad 5 has a simplistic but functional design
and i love it when engineers fuse metal into their devices
and i say that to say this
the lg g-pad 5 does have an aluminum back
i applaud you lg
i am feeling the aluminum
there is a 5 megapixel camera on the back side of the g pad
5 there is an 8 megapixel camera and just out of pure curiosity
i managed to grab some footage with this tablets camera
let's take a look
oh man this is terrible
it wasn't that painful or was it
alright let's keep it moving
the sim tray along with the sd card is located on the left
side of the tablet the volume and fingerprint sensor are located on the right side of the tablet
now this is not the fastest fingerprint sensor
i've used but it works and it works
well i like the ship
let's keep it moving
the g-pad 5 has a 10.1 edge-to-edge full hd lcd display at 1920x1200
this is not a deal breaker
the display is crisp with a decent amount of brightness
some photos some light gaming on a larger screen
alright next
let's see what the software is all about
the device is running an overweight version of android 9 aka
moving the device has a 8200 milliamp hour cell
the battery is definitely on point
all right let's keep it moving connectivity
the device supports standard wi-fi gps bluetooth version 4.2 and surprisingly lg did go with 3.5
millimeter jack now
personally i am over the headphone jack
you guys can keep it all right keeping it moving
let's check out the hardware
the lg g pad five floors is a quad core snapdragon 821 processor
just a few years ago
this processor was the to have however in comparison to today's processing power
the snapdragon 821 is a good mid-range processor
at best the device has 4 gigabytes of ram with 32 gigabytes of internal memory
also the g-pad 5 has expandable storage up to 512 gigabytes
i've got to mention this real fast before i continue folks
don't make the mistake i made
i thought i could use this
32 gigabyte tablet to edit my short videos
and damn was i wrong
this is just not the tablet
for that the lg g pad 5 will cost you
299 green stamps
that's not too bad
but the real downside to this trade-off is you will be paying well over 300 green stamps
at the end of the 24-month billing cycle fortunately there are cheaper and better options though
alright folks that is a wrap for the lg g-pad 5 10.1
it really does help out the channel and also consider subscribing
hold it down
i'll catch y'all on the rebound
hello everyone and welcome to droidforums net
i'm your host
I bring to you the tech glass
tpad x98 air 3g tablet
this tablet is quite a unique device
it's high-powered yet
it's inexpensive and has a boatload of features first and foremost it's a 9.7 inch diagonal IPS
iris display you'll find on the iPad air it's powered by Intel's Z 37 36 F processor
it's running full blown
Android KitKat 4.4
point for pre-installed
this should be no surprise since we are an Android family friendly forum but I do have a surprise
this is a dual boot device so it also can boot into a full-blown installation of Windows
8.1 tablet with office 365 as well now
I'm only evaluating the Android side
today it is a 3g tablet meaning it will connect to a cellular network it up to 3G speeds
and you're ready to go of course it has
it also has bluetooth for external headsets keyboards and other accessories
so let's take a look at the tablet in greater detail
there's nothing else remarkable about the front if we turn it to the side
first thing you'll see at the top is the power button
then you'll see the volume rocker up and down and then towards the bottom here
I'm pleased to see there's a an SD card slot
this thing supports up to 32 gig card slot to the manufacturer
that's a micro sim
then you see the headphone jack to the right and then another
welcome feature a micro-hdmi port
you'll see a white plastic strip across the top folks since this is a solid aluminum
shell the entire back of this of this device is one big sheet of aluminum formed for the sides
there needed to be a place for the antennas
so they creatively
you'll see a pair of speakers
so as you'll see there i have the google play store
ok and i can scroll through it
i can look at apps and see what apps are available
i can go to the free section and obviously as you can see
it's pretty snappy
everything moves pretty nicely and fluidly
this tablet boasts a 6.7 627
part me hour battery life and I can honestly say that
it's impressed me with its ability to run non-stop for half a day in the box
so they're of no use to me unfortunately along with that
you have the all-important charging block
this is a two and a half half charger
let me pick this one up for just a second
this is actually an adapter
so you could connect your your cell phone to it and I presume you would do either
data transfer or you could use it for wired tethering a number of different options
I haven't tried it so I can attest to the functionality okay
so let's look at this thing in operation a little bit more
I want to take you over to the gallery
I want to show you some impressive photos here
I'm going to turn this to landscape mode
the gallery really does show this device off
I'm going to back out of here and I'm going to go to the main part of the gallery as you can see
it's a beautiful display
I actually have this
display turned down because it overpowers the camera
so you're going to see the background
get pretty dull as I turn this up and then as we hit one of these pictures well again
obviously it's overpowering the camera but what a beautiful display the photos that come up on
this are just absolutely gorgeous
you know the responsiveness of this thing is just been amazing
it is never stalled or stuttered or giving me one glitch whatsoever
look at that
is that not impressive
that's your iPad air in an Android tablet
as a matter of fact overall the tablet has done nothing but impress me
point for it sports
all the expected settings and functionality
you'll see a row of buttons down here
let me turn this back down again
you'll see a row of buttons toward the bottom here
you've got your standard home
button your back button and your background apps running button
then you've got a volume down on a volume up and we've got another nice button here
this is a screen capture button so it automatically captures your screen for you
and then there's a menu button down here which in certain situations provides functionality
it doesn't provide any functionality in the home screen
ok folks you could go out and spend two three or even four times
I believe this is a great device
let me close
by saying the gear best is brought to droidforums.net an impressive array of products
not just this tablet
but a whole plethora of other gear that would be worthy of your consideration
they have everything from phones to tablets to accessories
free and much faster
I suggest you at least take a look at their offerings
you might just find that
you're pleasantly surprised at what they have
I hope you've enjoyed my review of the tech glass tpad x98 air 3g tablet
this is fox cat signing off and remember to visit the gear
best thread at the link below thank you
hi everyone today
this was just created before
Windows 10 came out as for the installation CD
it comes in at 12.5 inches by 16 point nine inches and has a width of two inches
not including the stands which is quite big
you'll need a lot of desk
space for this in
the act of drawing area is fifteen point nine inches by 10 inches
it has a TFT LCD screen with a screen resolution of 1440 by 900 pixels
the tablet has 2048 levels of pressure as well as 5080 lines per inch
it's very customizable and sturdy at every angle
now that we've gone over the specs
here's a couple of my own opinions while the tablet came with a vga cable
I went ahead and used a DVI input to experience the best quality
that's one of the few things that really dates us over
I was able to get the screen relatively close to another monitor that I use primarily
the tablets display leans towards a cooler tone when set to default
there was a bit of a halo around some of the colors caused by the screen
that is only noticeable when zoomed in and
I will show you a comparison between the monitor and tablet screens
time either way
it's always good practice to color
correct your work
I thought this would bother me while working on it since
I'm typically used to matte screen protectors but I was pleasantly surprised
the group wasn't there but I didn't really miss it
I used to travel to keep my hand from catching on the glass and it was generally a nice experience
I also found that the display did not easily scratch
I personally love the design weight and feel of this pen
it's very similar to the comp ends with a raised
Ridge and slightly raised buttons
the weight of the pen is towards the tip
making it very comfortable to draw while the tablet is upright
the nibs have some gifts but feel sturdy
the pen is hold a charge for a good length of time since
Photoshop and I didn't have any trouble with pressure sensitivity or straight lines
the lines are very fluid and easy to control
I didn't notice very much
jitter on the diagonal lines which is great and I didn't just go
the pen is the only thing that has programmable buttons on it and in the driver
it looks like you can't change those buttons to a keystroke at all like
I think this is a good entry
level display tablet
well it's a little bit older than most on the market
it's definitely still useful on Amazon
it goes for around $400 which is pretty much half the cost of the Proms smallest Cintiq but 13 HD
so that's about it
thank you all so much for watching you
Hey guys, this is Austin and today I’m here with a review of the Microsoft Surface RT tablet.
It’s a tablet that tries very hard to be a laptop and it’s undoubtedly unique
but is it any good?
The first thing that pictures don’t show you is that the Surface is big.
It’s certainly not a Retina Display but the saturation and black levels are top notch.
Below the display
there’s a capacitive
Windows button which works like the Windows key
The rear camera is tilted downward which takes a bit of getting used to
but seriously don’t take pictures with a tablet.
Running down the ports along the left side you’ll find a volume rocker and headphone jack
and on the right is the charging port, USB 2.0 and Micro HDMI.
It feels very well built and closes with a nice snap but it’s not adjustable.
Hidden behind the kickstand is a MicroSD card slot which supports cards up to 64GB.
Speaking of specs the Surface RT is powered by a quad core Nvidia Tegra 3 processor clocked at 1.3
GHz along with 2GB of RAM.
Performance is impressive as Windows
RT runs extremely smoothly practically everywhere in the OS.
at which point the tablet slows down considerably.
The Surface RT runs Windows RT which is Windows 8 for ARM processors.
There are pluses and minuses
to this, for example battery
life is excellent with between 6 to 9 hours on a charge and a slim 9.4mm frame.
On the flip side you lose out on a lot of processing power: even the quad core
The biggest downside is the fact that you lose all compatibility with legacy Windows apps.
No Google Chrome, no Battlefield 3 and no Photoshop are available on the Surface RT.
RT is still clearly a 1.0
release and the illusion shatters.
At times the Surface feels like a glimpse into the future
The price is really where it hits home.
The Surface RT starts at $499 for 32GB
however you basically need the Touch
Cover to get everything out of it
which brings your total to $599.
Compare that with $399 for the Nexus 10 and $499 for the iPad 4
and you end up with something that isn’t a great tablet and isn’t a great laptop.
but right now it just isn’t.
Feel free to check out more videos on the Surface here and hit up that
Like button if you enjoyed!
Anyway guys, I will catch you in the next one!
and you know my plastic oled
hello everyone welcome back to another vlog in today's video guys we will be talking again

hey guys this is watch from the mw network and today we're doing a review for the toshiba thrive
you can see that
the toshiba thrive just weighs under 1.66
pounds making it a bit heavier than most the tablets that are out there
now if we talk about ergonomics and how this thing feels in your hand overall
it's all right
the one nice thing about this tablet is at the back
you have a very nice rubberized
the biggest downside towards this tablet is its overall shape
it's extra long kind of shape doesn't really make sense
one of the best things about it is its functionality
the first button is the power and standby the one right next to it is the volume rocker
and then right next to it is a orientation lock located just to the top
side of the device contains a small locking switch on the opposite side
now let's get into some of the serious stuff in terms of technical specifications
this tablet runs an nvidia tegra 250 processor
which is clocked in one gigahertz and has one megabyte of l2 cache memory
and it's capable of replicating 16 million colors in terms of how this display
looks like in real life
it really reflects some of its specifications
the colors are fairly vibrant
this tablet is really fully featured as you would expect from a modern day computing device
it has both bluetooth version
2.1 and broadcom 802.11
i managed to get an average of six to seven hours of battery life
i'm sure you can get better if you monitor
how many things are running in the background
it has a good management system for you to do that
keep in mind that this tablet does also run flash
this actually runs android honeycomb 3.1
thanks to that
tegra 250 processor
if i had to complain with anything i would say that
tablets that use non-flash mediums
currently the toshiba thrives comes in three different versions
you have the age 16 and 32 gig versions
the nice thing is thanks to the sd card slot
you can buy the 8 gig which is under 400 and basically expand the memory up to 128 gigabytes
thanks to its hdmi connection
you can take a standard hdmi port directly connected into your tv and directly
connect it into the toshiba thrive and basically right then and there mirror your display
which is great for presentations
that are out there
if you can slim it down make it a little more linear
models is better heat management systems
this is going to be increasingly important
i think this is a fantastic tablet device
i believe it's really a no-brainer
that are out there
we will be testing this
toshiba thrive against the hp touchpad and the ipad 2 in terms of making those direct comparisons
so make sure to subscribe and watch out for those videos in the very near future
let me know in the comments down below or message us on youtube as well
we're going to be doing some direct
uh there's some great there's always some great comments out there and we thank everyone of you
who enjoy our videos
so thank you so much and we'll see you next time take care
it guys today
I'm going to be reviewing the Wacom
don't really tell you so without further ado
this is the video review on the
Wacom Bamboo capture tablet the included software with the Wacom
I think it's a point
O and SketchBook Pro
I do graphic design SketchBook
Pro is a pretty powerful tool
so what you'll notice
is the additional like tools that you have inside
Photoshop let me go ahead and click one of these really quick
that wind press have a different function
there is no no wireless included with the bamboo
US dollars one thing you do want to note
is this pin
that is included with the bamboo
capture does not include an eraser now
I read some reviews online
that said that it did before
then the bamboo capture is for you
it had features a great price range at around just a hundred dollars u.s. dollars
of course
if you have any questions please feel free to ask them but I definitely recommend getting
the bamboo capture tablet from welcome
everybody gets LAN Seidman and we're checking out a really odd computer from Acer today
they had some neat stuff with the screen
where you could pull it off and flip it around this one unfortunately is not as cool as that one
they tried to make it almost kind of like a surface a Microsoft Surface designed to some extent
it's got the same kind of kickstand kind of approach to things but it really isn't
it does have a nice display though
it's got a 1920 by 1080 display really good viewing angles on it
it's one of the new fan list chips from Intel
this is an 800 megahertz part about the same as you would see an other core
M chips chipset based computers
comparative is the asus ux305
that has the same chip
but it has 8 gigs of ram and a 256 gigabyte
SSD for $6.99
now you'll see here that we've got it in kind of its hybrid mode here
the magnets will kind of line up
and it'll almost dock itself it just snaps into place on its own
it really is a yeah sort
a comfortable typing experience
I thought was a very disturbing decision here
these keyboards are very low
what they have done is put in one of these little pointer
the screen will translate all of that motion
you have a volume rocker up and down
the windows button is here
and then you have a headphone microphone
jack at the top
you have a power and standby button as well as a micro
SD card slot for putting on some external storage
which might be helpful because you only have 128 gigs of storage on the main device
all the hardware decisions aside
this actually does perform quite well the core
M processor has been something
well we're gonna take a look at that now
alright so
it renders the page relatively quickly
and we can scroll through everything we can even get the ads popping up very quickly as well
I will go over to a YouTube page real quick and just see some videos on there
I should note that the speakers are in the front here
they don't sound very good
they're a bit tinny
they can be loud enough to project what you want to project out of it
I think it has wireless AC onboard and it definitely supports the 5 gigahertz
Wi-Fi yet does have AC and supports 5 gigahertz channel
so you're gonna get some of the newer
Wi-Fi access points working with this without issues next
we're gonna do
real quick is pop open
I go but you can see though it does
it is able to make adjustments on the fly here very quickly
give or take when you're doing basic work tasks like productivity
you know we're processing web browsing email
Core M machines at this price point because are gonna perform about the same
but you'll get a computer
Windows tablets running the full version of Windows 8.1
that cost about a hundred bucks
this doesn't really perform the two tasks it sets out to do very well this is LAN Simon
thanks for watching you
hey what is up guys
I'm Kim PhD
here and over the past couple of days
I've been asked a lot about the Nvidia shield tablet
a lot of people are buying this specifically for the gaming features
and it's really good at that but if you know me
I'm really not much of a gamer at all
so this is a short video
let's take a look so first of all this
has some pretty beastly specs
so it's packing
and all the rest of the hardware is geared towards showcasing that new k1 chip in fact
that's really what this whole tablet is all about so nothing too flashy going on with the design
it's pretty compact
it's not the best build in the world but you can see it's it's solid
it's got a pretty standard array of ports headphone jack
this is one of a few tablets just a few with front-facing speakers
I mean this isn't even a premium price tablet it's pretty mid-range and these speaker
drivers really aren't even that good
grill is the front-facing camera
they're pretty awful
they're really stiff and have almost zero travel
there's a wireless controller
there's dedicated software hub and everything but like
tablet running almost pure stock
Android with a few Nvidia improvements and I really like that
I put the Google experience launcher on here
and not only
does it feel really familiar and comfortable
but because it's stock
Android with no skin and that beastly NVIDIA k1
everything is fast fluid and smooth
it's a 1080p
eight inch display
so it's pretty sharp but again the panel is just mid-range
it's a little on the warm side
I fired up an application that honestly on any other
Android tablet lags and stutters and drop streams like crazy and that's Google Earth
a very old app
but you've probably experienced yourself
I opened it up here on the shield tablet and the k1 handled it like a boss
almost zero dropped frames beautiful fluid movement might actually finally be the first
you get fast performance
it's kind of kind of what you look for when you're buying a tablet and this basically nails it now
yes they added a stylus to the back of this tablet
it's made just for the shield
it's like a felt-tip pen and it kind of rocks
it's awesome
okay another thing
NVIDIA has added to the stock Android experience was some performance modes and
I really couldn't even tell the difference
how that throttles they also added
HDMI settings since there's a mini HDMI port
and of course settings for any controller
there's also in the quick settings a toggle for full screen mode which is basically
this tablet is full-featured
it's packed it's legit
that kind of stuff
so that's a good sign for this new tablet
I think they'll also get a few software updates maybe see Android L soon
you know what those rumors of an 8-inch volantis
Nexus tablet with front-facing speakers
Nvidia keep it up
thanks for watching guys and I'll talk to you in the next one peace
last week
I picked one of these up and I tuned my car with it
let's talk about a huge huge outfit in the room
do you get more power
the short answer is yes but more power is a little misleading for contacts
my car has an aftermarket cat header and I'm running the stage to tune and with that combination
the torque dip is almost completely done
this is exactly where the more power thing comes from
when you're flooring it you hit 3k rpms
become a rocket so yes
the car is so much more fun to drive but now moving on
I want to talk about the open
flash tablets strongest point
and that's the point as you can see a new open
and seventy five abducts six hundred seventy five dollar price tag comes from the
ECU tech license and the other $300 is just for their tune so at five hundred dollars
you're already saving one hundred and seventy five bucks off of a tune from say delicious
I'm not trying to say that open
I just don't think it's worth it and an even better news
you might not even have to pay five hundred dollars for your open
flash tablet the news market for these
things are insanely good
I picked mine up for three hundred and fifty dollars
just a few other things before we go on discuss the things
I don't like about the tune the tablet
I've noticed that with this tune
the car runs a lot more smoothly
it's almost stalling with the tune
that problem is completely gone
I do like I'm gonna go ahead and move on to all the things that I don't like about it first off
shell just feels cheap for five hundred dollars brand-new
I would have hoped for something that didn't look like it came out of 2005
you wouldn't want it to look and feel like the way this looks in the fields
the second thing
I really don't like about this tablet
open it up with the software download the actual tune file
and then go
it's really just lazy
coding which leads me to my next point
I have a lot of things to say about the open flash manager none of which are positive so
I'm gonna scribe it in three words
it's clunky it's outdated and it's a pile of talk garbage
that's more than three words
you have to go on their confusing website
and don't get me started on if you want to
actually edit the tune files itself that process is probably one of the worst things
I've ever been through in my life
the point is just like the open
that's 14 years ago
I recommend the open flash tablet yes I would
my car's torque tip is almost completely gone so just putting it out there
this thing paired with an aftermarket header will nearly get rid of your torque dip
it works whatever the reason
I say that I wouldn't buy it
I have the first version
this is their debut version and right now they're currently on the version
that's it other than that
the two tablets work exactly the same
it'll read your ECU you'll get a tune it's identical and the reason that I say I would not buy
is that the version 2 is better
it writes faster but it doesn't actually affect the tune file itself
I'd like to hear what you guys think
I read every single comment and I try to respond to every single one as well other than that
I hope this video has helped
thank you so much for watching
you have any more questions again
feel free to ask in the comments below
thanks for watching
I'll catch you guys next time peace out
i'll be showing you the process
we'll be looking at this
time is a gaumon m106k pro
it's a brand new model
that was just released
it has a 10 by 6 and a quarter inch work area 12 shortcut keys and 16 soft keys
that you tap with your pen
it has 8192 levels of pen pressure to ensure that your lines look crisp
oh and bags for all of those things
the cool thing about this tablet is that it also works with android phones
you can plug this bad boy into your phone and draw on there if you want
i recommend getting an extra pen
so if you think this is the tablet for you now's the time to go get it anyway for this video
i'll be breaking down the process
i use when animating basically i'll just be showing you
what goes into animating
a character say for an animation
meme or a gif or a gif
i usually work with 24 frames per second and i also use krita to animate so
that's what i'll be using here
i bet you'll never guess what character we'll be animating
yeah now let's get started first things first
think of what you want to animate
i almost always have a pretty clear idea of what i'll be doing before
i even put my pen on the screen
think about the timing backgrounds color
whatever is relevant to what you're gonna make once you know what you're gonna do
it's time to get started
i always start by sketching out my key frames
all you have to do with this
stage is lay out the motion or action
that will be animated
make sure everything's consistent and then go back to add features along with this
i didn't sketch a background here because the background was already drawn for this
since it's part of an animation meme but my point still stands at this stage
it could also be smart to make some color keys of what colors you want everything to be
then you'll know what to use later on a tip
for making your animations look real nice is to animate on an arc
i guess there's plenty of videos
that talk about arcs already on youtube and i totally recommend looking so up after
you've got your rough sketch down
it's time to start adding some more structure
you don't have to fill in every single frame
it will save time if you pick and choose
you've gotten it to a point you're satisfied with the next step is up to you
you can either clean up the sketches you just made or you can skip straight to the line art
the reason i'm saying this is because it kind of depends on how you work
i don't usually clean up the sketch because it saves time which is a really good thing
i wasn't sure what to expect from the soft keys because i've never used those before
but they turned out to be really useful
you can set your shortcut keys to common buttons
that's what i did and it was worth it aside from all the shortcut
keys this tablet's quality is great for the price
i also tried it out with an android phone as you already saw and it worked pretty okay
i still prefer it on my laptop though since the scaling is a bit easier compared to a tiny phone
i also have an iphone so i can't really use it anyway overall
it's a pretty good tablet
if you're in the market for a new tablet i totally recommend it
especially if you're looking for a tablet with lots of shortcut options for faster drawing
it might be a little bit confusing for beginners though
your animation will look nice and smooth even if the drawing itself isn't perfect
you'll be left with this little gap here
invert the selection and erase out the part of the gradient
alright that about sums up how i animate or at least how i animate ghost
i've got it's the hawaiian inspiroi
inc graphics tablet
you can't really see it very well
it's all black
everything's all really nice
it's actually two-sided i'll show you the other side in a minute
um what i'm going to do now
you can program the area to be smaller if you want to
i don't think that's a great idea but you can change the rotation of it as well
i suppose
if you're doing it you can do it on your mobile phone as well which is brilliant
but you might want to change the orientation to portrait
perhaps to do that way you can change to pen
i've got my button on the pen
you see the buttons on here
let's get a little close up on that one
so they've got a top button and a bottom button
my top button is the right
click which is quite handy so if i press that uh it's not gonna work there
is it so press it over here
no i'm in this
i'm in there so it's not gonna work on there on the bottom
i've got shift e which is a raise on the software so with this
we double click on here and then we can change it to whatever we want you can control
you can shift it you can out
you can windows
um colors already organized so you basically just start drawing
yeah you must be able to tell who it is now so now we'll get the what we're doing
we want the picker tool
so let's get that and then bucket fill
let's go there
oops that's not going to work
we need to get the color picker back and then pencil
fill that in anywhere else
yep okay
it's not amazing is it
but it's can i fill that in there
we go look at that and let's just do a bit there
there's a gap there
um can i pick a one pencil fill in the gap easy color picker green
uh bucket fill that one
oh there no no undo undo there now we're getting somewhere okay
we have a goofy
that's not too bad
i think that was like a quick one
i've drawn it better before waiting just a little bit there
whoa really easy there okay
there's my goofy whoops there we go
there's my goofy
that's obviously a quick jobby and obviously you can
i just wanted to show you how easy it is to do
this one i think is is called the practice side
it fills up
you can fill up the whole screen look for bread and then delete it
but that's what this side is for
you do all your good stuff on here
so that's it from me
i hope you've enjoyed this video
it's probably gonna be an amazon affiliate link um and okay
that's it okay
thanks for joining me on this
uh video
uh i'll catch you later on
see you later bye you
oh product that
we're gonna start with the unboxing we've got a QuickStart guide that basically explains well
what is what and then
we've got a full-blown 1ul in seven
different languages that is also
AC adapter the power brick and the cable itself which is nice because it's a Type C cable
C charging port
then we've got a power button volume up and volume down as well
there is nothing on the sides and then on the back
we've got this rubberized back over plus the 8 megapixel camera as well
it's really nice doesn't slide
it's really comfy to hold
so that is the tablet itself
we've got the 20
80 by 720 screen
obviously expandable with the memory card
they say 2020 and so very up-to-date
then we've got the digital and well being parent course parental controls
we've got the storage manager which will remove some apps
sorry pictures and videos if it finds that we don't browse them anymore
pretty self-explanatory in terms of display
obviously the font size ended display size is fully adjustable to your liking
I would just say the cameras there
but that's that when it comes to recording video
the back facing camera is 720p
the front-facing camera is 480p
and it works
you don't need anything else
C - full USB a adapter
it's a full-blown
Mouse support something that Apple just recently released with their iPads
it is a full-blown word as well which works really
well you've got the auto correction you've got the spellcheck you've got you can count
how many characters you've got in your text as well
I have to admit for the price you pay
it's a pretty decent device
you can watch movies on it
you can listen to music on it
you can create documents on it you can edit
Excel spreadsheets on it
you then game on it ends because the second 10 inch device it actually
it's pretty easy to edit these documents or or use it for media consumption yeah overall
I'm using which mice I'm using
that's they the these are the devices
I wanted to touch on
it lasts days it lasts days
so yeah thanks for watching out there episode of quick expert reviews and
I'll speak to you soon guys bye
I only just last fall tried out my first Amazon Fire HD tablet the Fire HD 8 and
I'm Erin from tech gadgets Canada calm and the Amazon fire
10 is Amazon's newest tablet
it's bigger than the 8 and it has a more widescreen format
I don't know how well you're gonna be able to see that there
it's got better resolution a more powerful processor
plus it has some other significant improvements
I had a chance to spend several weeks with it and this is what I found but before we get to that
keep making more videos here on
YouTube so what's the difference between a Fire HD 8 and the Fire HD 10
the most obvious is size
well the 10 here allows for 32 and 64 gigabytes
the camera is also different
Canada calm to see the exact comparisons if you want but I'm going to sum it up here for you
the 10 definitely faster than the 8 though
it's obviously not nearly as fast as something like the iPad pro when I reviewed the Fire HD 8
I couldn't get it to work at least this time
I could sue the Smart Home gadgets
I already had connected inside the app
but the voice control option wasn't working and nor was show mode
this is definitely disappointing
it might be a big drawback for some shoppers
the speakers on this tablet get pretty loud
but they're good holding the tablet horizontally
I'd say yes
I do think the video can be a bit dark and watching very dark scenes
like what you'd see on the saint's a Bosch was a bit of a challenge overall
this tablet is loaded with apps and productivity tools too as a web browser called silk email
Maps contacts calendars
I quickly added Spotify YouTube Netflix in - Graham Twitter and Google keep
I found many of the daily apps I use on my iPhone are also available in Amazon's app store
so that was a nice surprise now disappointingly audible is still not available in Canada
so using that app is a bit of a mystery
I also couldn't see things like Canadian banking apps or Canadian news apps
and you demand responsiveness and a slight lag
it would drive you nuts then
I would upgrade to the ten you can read the full review of this tablet
a tech gadgets
Canada com
that helps us keep making more videos that we hope everyone out
there can watch enjoy and learn from until next time

hello a couple weeks ago
the folks at artists all sent me their latest drawing tablet the d13 to try out and I'm impressed
so the v13 is a 13 inch drawing tablet it compares very closely to the 13-inch
Cintiq tablet now
this is one of those drawing tablets
that doesn't come with
Windows or anything pre-installed
it looks like the
Cintiq it pretty much has the same specs as the Cintiq it smells like a Cintiq
you might ask why would I get this instead of a Cintiq
the answer is priced the
D 13 sells for 599 dollars whereas the entry-level Cintiq sells for $200 more 799 now
there are cheaper larger tablets out there like the
Huon 18 inch but with a lot of those tablets
the quality is hit or miss after using this tablet for a few weeks
it looks like what their goal is is to become a real way come competitor not just a knockoff
doing cheaper tablets
I haven't used the latest Wacom 13 inch
Cintiq tablet the Wacom that I'm used to is the slightly older 12 inch version
so that's going to give me a little variation in this review
too one thing
it feels solid the screen and the quality
the buttons are much better than I expected any of the cheaper Cintiq alternatives
that are out there right now have some flaws to them
they feel cheap
you'll find things like dust under the screen or dead pixels
that's none of that online
I've got used to drawing on devices like the surface that don't have any tactile buttons to press
the hardware buttons along the side are mapped to things
I'm used to thinking of touch commands
but that's going to cost you a thousand dollars instead of the $7.99 lower end version
I missed was being able to pinch in order to zoom in and out
having a real scroll wheel dedicated to that
spend me up quite a bit now
the included stylus was much lighter than what
I'm used to working with
the stylus is standalone also like many
Wacom tablets
there's a little bit of resistance to the screen
that's a good thing
seems like on my old
Wacom that matte surface seemed to dim the screen
but that wasn't the case here
a lot of those types of things like the pressure sensitivity is also adjustable
I've used in
the last few years is jitter on the strokes as you can see from these drawing examples
not because of the pen and that's the way it should be one thing
I want to touch upon
though is the stand
the stand is an extra fifty dollars but it's kind of Awesome
yep now I got the drivers up and running on both Mac and Windows
I also tried to plug it into my surface pro to see if it would work
anyway actually confirm that with the artists
own rep who said yeah
it's not going to work on the surface tablet that's okay
I had some Wacom drivers installed but I didn't actually notice any conflict
I only encounter one real problem while using the tablet early on when I was playing with it
Pixelmator that I was playing with on the Mac less than other programs
El Capitan never gets old when I first took it out
my hand just didn't feel quite right on the pen screen
who knows maybe my hands were just filthy
so there's almost like no difference between where you're drawing in the glass on this monitor
you can definitely tell it there is a
I want to call it a gap but the gap
the glass is a little bit thicker
and you definitely tell that it's offset from the screen
a little bit again only something
I noticed because I've used the iPad pro on the surface a lot so to wrap it all up
this is a great device often times when you look at
Wacom competitors you're sacrificing something to get that lower price but with the artisan v13
I don't think you're really sacrificing much of anything this thing is just as good as anyway come
I've ever used so if you want to learn more
I'm going to leave a link down in the description that takes you to the Amazon page
Twitter right now
I'm working on a review for app for the ipad called meaty bang mehdi bang
i don't know how it's pronounced and gonna figure that out in the next two weeks
it's really cool drying up
I will see you in a few weeks you
hello internet world and welcome to my review of the veek vk 1200.
this is a pen display or graphics tablet with a really good ips display
built in
this was very kindly sent in free of charge by the manufacturer
so this is what you get inside the box
tips or nibs
then you get the pen itself
this is really nice very very comfortable to hold nicely tapered at the top
i was surprised
now i've note
but normally i'd have this lane flat on the desk now
the vk 1200 measures 318 by 289 by just 12 millimeters thick
the pen is battery free
that's worth noting so you don't have to charge this
that you're using of course within the application also worth noting
it's really very very good indeed
they've done a great job on how this pen interacts with the vk
1200 display now
why would you want a graphics tablet or a display like this
well you can of course get graphics tablets that allow you to do drawing
uh that is not uh on a display just uh just to interact with your computer display
you get some disconnection there being able to draw directly onto the image
let me just change colors here just so you can see a bit clearer
it's just a fantastic experience being able to draw direct onto the display
it's much much more natural
it looks absolutely fantastic
and what
i've really been impressed with is the price point on the vk 1200
you're getting so much value for money
i can certainly highly recommend it of note
that's on the pdf manual available on their website
thank you very much for watching
i really do appreciate it
if you want to pick up a vk 1200 for yourself
there are links down in the video description
there's also a link down there to the veek website
thanks for watching
i'll see you next time
hi everyone so
I'm here today to talk about this tablet small cheap a compact little hue on each 420
so is this for beginners or not
this is the kind of video
I have no idea about that game
the tablet runs about $30 on Amazon
there is one version five dollars
this tablet is tiny almost uncomfortably
I said it's tiny
it's essentially like drawing on a business card as I said earlier
this tablet has 3 programmable
Express gates on the side allowing you to set them to the erase tool zoom in zoom out keys
and whatever you want it's all set up through the
Wii on pin tablet driver
meaning you can only use the side of the pen with a nuke
it's a large cone and a little less springing
it is replaceable
and it came with a few extra nibs
whenever you buy the tablet the last thing is the court
it's a detachable me
it has rather high specs for such a simple little thing but how does it actually perform
I'll go ahead and give it the biggest drawback the dragger
this thing is pinky it seems to hate most pcs while working relatively smooth on
Mac OSX tuna
I tried it once on Windows 7 and no matter how much I tried no matter what I did
it never became fully functional
I tried it later on Windows 10 and it worked flawlessly similar to how the Mac handles it
so that's a big part to take into account
that is the bet aside
let's draw this is some footage
I captured while drawing with it on my PC
I'm using paint tool
I admit I'm pretty spoiled by my team to his pro
when it came to details in color it was great
I don't have cramps while drawing but with this tablet it definitely caused quite a few
the pen has a nice weight to it
thanks to a battery inside of it but the shape is still a bit uncomfortable to me
I found myself getting lost
losing the cursor
remember the active area on
this tablet is 4 inches by 2
it was even more painful to draw
the tablet even has any pressure at all causing an error to show up in the brush panel well
Photoshop is iffy
it works fine with both paint tool
Sai and Medibank paint Pro so all in all
it's something that if you have the right setup you can get used to it would
I recommend it to beginners
maybe not unless you have the patience to get the drivers working
it is cheap though
$30.00 is amazing
I wish I could have gotten my first tablet
become graph ir4 for that cheap
this isn't the only cheap tablet out there though
I have to find one while planning in this video it's called the XP pen G 430
this is just a smidge bigger than the
Beyond but lacks three buttons on the side
I have no idea
the buttons on the pen are customizable
so there is another option
I hope this kind of helped anybody
thanks for watching and I'll see you next week it
we got a brand new tablet company releasing next week or this week by the time
i'm releasing this
it should be this week
but they're releasing their first tablet and that company is named senslab
everything from this point forward is my honest opinion and i can tell you i am blown away
this is the first tablet company that i really really think can give wacom a run for their money
um all the other tablet companies even though they have grown greatly over the past few years
i'll talk to you soon
so what comes in the box
when you open up your sense labs tablet
i want to start off with the carrying case
the section for the tablet does have a nice silky cushioned
uh feeling fabric
that's going to protect your tablet on the go from there
we get a nice pen case to carry around our stylus on and this has two different pen
stylus one skinny one with two buttons and one thicker tapered one with three buttons
it's an all metal build and a very premium matte drawing surface to draw on
you also get three shortcut keys on the top
and you can customize them to your heart's content from there
there is on the top left section
a lock so that you can lock it and secure it to a desk now
so this is a huge benefit for me
the rgb lights that are on the the tablet itself which is kind of cool
i thought it was a nice touch
and then you can diagnose and see how heavy your pen pressure is
the drawing experience is a lot better on the sense
labs medium tablet
i do want to talk about a few final thoughts that i have on this thing
i think what senselab did here is amazing
it's awesome
they're killing it because if this is their first go on a professional grade tablet from them
i'm excited to see what they have coming down the pipeline in the future
i did confirm from them
they are coming out with a display tablet
this might not be in your price bracket and that's okay
um you guys should check out senselabs
it's a great great alternative to wacom
it comes in lower
it's premium grade material
like i think this feels better than anything
wacom is coming out with right now as far as these types of tablets so again sense labs
that's the company
i'm gonna leave it here
i'm gonna end it here for you guys
like and subscribe and i will talk to you guys later
uh wherever you guys are at whenever you guys are at have a good night
good day good weekend have a good life guys
love you peace so you
hello this is simason corner
and this is my review for the tech class p80x android tablet
banggood sent me this to review
good standard what you get in
the box is no more or less than the essentials
you need to get started
i'm going to skip showing you the formalities of the setup process
it's pretty standard stuff
you enter your google account details
i've reviewed quite a few products in my time
but this is the very first tablet review for me so i wondered
i ran and at the end of the video
you will find my summary and verdict
we have geekbench running here which is a well-respected benchmarking application
i'm not running this clip in real time
i also want to mention now
p80x does have this capability
what do these numbers mean
we managed about half that here
but the upload speed did max out at the limit of my broadband connection for reference
any small text or images can be enlarged with multi-touch screen gestures
but we're not done here yet
dropping it down to 120 hertz and we're hitting 120 fps a lot of the time as the race program
hello this is simracing nice
um wow that's metal as well
that's pretty robust
i have to say i did know that
can you see the screen there
it's got plenty of charge comes
hello this is simracing corner and this is my review racing um to me
you'll need to excuse my bad gameplay as it was a difficult filming angle
come on you completed
disable the lasers blocking the hallway
the terminal should accept your fingerprint
now what killed him i did
he was standing too close to a power conduit from the laser blockade
get his weapon
you'll need for this level
hopefully it'll be too busy with zombies
soon find the generator
not don't forget
watch out the security guard has just activated what sorry
it wasn't powered so i missed it
luckily it doesn't have any orders concerning you so it let you go
go to the generator
i'm sorry for this complication
that's all the game testing over and finally testing the camera
it's really snappy everything i've thrown at it runs great
the screen is bright and clear
sound from the speaker is not amazing but it is good enough and certainly loud enough
of course
there is a 3.5
millimeter jack to plug in your own headphones
should you want to the battery
it's very solid check out other reviews
read the user reviews on the banggood product page
it's top marks for most users
i think what tech class have done here is really good
they've tried to get the max out of the technology available today at the lowest possible price
and i think they've really managed to do this very very well for me
it is a winning combination
it's the right price for a good all-round performer
and i do love a bargain
okay let's wrap up the review
hello youtube today is Saturday februari 20th 2016
and it's only two days until the opening of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in Spain
World Congress actually starts but that's okay of course I can do that
IV in berlin so will they announced a new flagship phone that said six possibly not
and maybe they're gonna do new
this was announced
and this is the sony
i love mine in july 2015 and
so why would they stop doing that
I have an idea about that but we'll have to wait and see what they say on Monday
let's start by taking a look at the design of the Sony Xperia set for tablets
and as you can see it is pretty nondescript
I read somewhere some I possibly Albert Einstein
they are living by that
Cree do because this is very very dialed back and muted
basically it's just a as you can see a black rectangle up here
it is not much to see either
you have a sony logo and an xperia logo
you have a camera
it is a kind of nice feeling to the plastic that a velvety kind of surface
it's the power button
you have a microphone jack up here you also have a flap which i will try to open
i have it open in many times
of course
there's a this protective thing here because this tablet is like most Sony Xperia stuff rated ip68
you can submerge it and have it in a sandstorm or something on the other side right here
you have the micro
USB charging port right there standard charging port no docking on this tablet on the bottom side
you have nothing but this plastic edge surprisingly not very scratched
you have the volume rocker and the volume
rocker is painted black
are there no speakers on this thing
which gives you it
that came out with a set three phone so that works very well
there is a problem with the speakers
because if you hold this your hand will probably cover the speakers
I don't know why they put to speak is down here
there's another design feature that is worth notice noticing and that is around this edge
there is a very slight lip on the plastic
the surface is fraction of a millimeter above the the
I weighed mine the other day and it was 370 grams
i have a magazine of the kind i usually buy when
I'm traveling I don't really know why i buy these
the magazine is tiny tiny bit thinner and they also
listen to music
read news surf the web
check my email with this
I can only read whatever they written in this issue
which is you know boring
so set for tablet is it is better than a magazine
it is a 10.1 inch at IPS
Sony's TV marketing
inch quad HD which means 2560 by 1600 pixels
so it's pretty high resolution and it looks absolutely gorgeous to me
that was a big problem
LG v10 phone because of the Bob
I don't know it was because of the overheating problem
it never had any problems with overheating or stuttering or anything like that
so i'm guessing sony did something with the heat dissipation and it worked very well
its got three gigs of ram
millimeters and this version weighs in at approximately 375 grams
the LTE version is slightly heavier but still not very heavy at all
if you're doing that you're doing it wrong
so those are the specifications of the set for tablets
this is the Xperia set for screen as you can see
it is a quad
HD 10 inch displays and it is pretty nice
it is what sony call a triluminos display
i'm not entirely sure what that means
but if you go and talk to erica griffin
i'm sure she can tell you all about it
in fact i think she did in one other video so you can check that out but to me
it's sufficient to say that it is a very nice screen
it is not a super amoled that like the Samsung screens which means my opinion
it was basically perfect out of the box
I never had any reason to feel with those settings at all
it is pretty quick
it's got the Snapdragon 810 SOC which is a very good cpu or SOC
it came out when it first came out
they had a lot of problems with it
because it overheated and it also overheated in
Sony's said 3 + / set for phone but with this
I never had any problems with it
I'm saying that now but it's not available for Android all right here
we go obviously
I'm in the middle of something
I haven't actually played this for some time
yeah no that's not a good idea
I have no idea where is where I am so I'm just going to run away
alright this is not a good game
I'm going to skip out of this
the point is
I will cut those films in as well another game that I really like at the moment is Lara
Croft go
which is a new game
but this really isn't a very demanding game you can play that pretty much on anything
I think it's just going to one of these
I played this before so I actually know what I'm doing and I was well
I don't really know what I'm doing possibly I could know what I'm doing and here
we go deletion the reason
I like this game so much
is that it kind of shows in my opinion what you can do on a tablet and
I wish there were more games like this
I don't really like the racing games and stuff like that
I really like these kinds of games and I would like to see more of them
the storage is a bit limited on this tablet because i bought the cheapest one so having installed
because i don't play them but i will show you those in a different clip into my mind
this really is all
I need from my tablet in terms of power
this is the 810 chipset as I said it doesn't get very warm at all
it gets a bit warm ish up here in this area
LaVista deadly you enter the world of pain burn
is you know personal opinion or speculation
I can't help but wonder what should suddenly do to improve on this
I can change the size
of course they can make it bigger or smaller
they can change the vessels because the vessels are quite distinct in
they could make it thinner
they could make it lighter
all right you can make it thinner
possibly but it's kind of shave you know fractions of a millimeter or something like that off
it's not going to make a big difference
I don't think that will make much of a difference
the same goes for the chipsets if they upgrade from the 810
Snapdragon to the a20
it's going to be an improvement
it's nice but it's not that big a step really
it's just incremental improving something
that already is almost perfect and I think that's a problem with sewing these days
simple very utilitarian
same goes for the sony scheme
for android it's minimal
these days they try to make it close to stock
because they couldn't really get any better than the said
I think they're in the same situation with the tablet
they can't really do anything more to it making it
you know a big step forward
they can only do incremental steps which means that it won't be a new flagship
they tried adding the fingerprint sensor for the set 5 phone
in my opinion that wasn't very successful kind of ruined this very nice
I've been told it it isn't actually working very well as the fingerprint sensor so that try
that didn't quite work
they tried to do the 5.5 inch 4k display and no one was really impressed with that
and it's impressive
so hmm we'll certainly pull out of the tablet the sea possibly actually
I think it's possible that they will at least take a timeout
and say we're not going to do this for a while
due by the cell phone tablet it is a very good tablet
it is still in my opinion
the best android tablet out there
it is very good
that's too bad
because i use is every day seriously
I use it every day
I use it when traveling
i usually run at home
you know everything in tablet is all about
that's what I use it for
then you should probably take a look at that because
it becomes pretty apparent that you know you can upgrade the SOC
you can get more round
I think the reason for this is that there is no real software incentive to get the new hardware
we don't see money medic games or apps that use the extra ram we don't see anything in
Android that would go make it use of the ram for multitasking or anything like that
the apps are not made to be multitasked in android
xperia set for tablet
I can play two games
I really love them
you can't even see them in the PlayStation Store
sorry google play store unless you have at least three gigs of ram in your device
the thing is though playing xcom enemy within on this works brilliantly
it is a good platform to play that game
and that's a big game
I think we need to see for tablets to you
know get out early and mud there currently is for more developers to release games like that
then why should you pay extra for this
you know there's no point so for
so that's why
I think that tablets are even phones are diminishing in sales these days
I can still play all the games I've tried on my set three phone which is a year and a half old now
it's running the 801 chipset
SOC why should I upgrade it why should I pay you know five six hundred
US dollars for a new phone when my own phone is still working perfectly and doing the job
yeah the business is in a difficult position right now
I'm looking forward to that
but for everyone else
I think you need to start looking at the software
get those games pushing the machines
so that's my opinion on that
hey guys peter here with judy bridge calm
we have the nuke 7 tablet
you might be saying well
this has been out for a while
it didn't cause too clear anyways
here's some specs you can read on the back
check it out
I'm not going to lie
it looks pretty normal
sorry about the reflectiveness woke up because it is a flush screen of bezel
it's going to be very reflective
yeah we have the back
the back kind of has its own personality
you see that you have a center eyes camera
you have a kind of nice hard rubber plastic volume up and down power button
nothing on the bottom
that's awesome camera as I said you don't have a light package
you don't have a flash package nothing to go along with it you have a 3.5 mm headphone jack
a hard reset button and a dedicated microUSB port
the front is flush screen a bezel with a camera on the front
we're not going to show you
what the physical tablet is capable of because a tablet is a tablet is a tablet
I mean they're all capable of playing
anyways we're going to just go through the Nook stuff we're not going to go through
Play Store Google Chrome or settings
anything like that
so we're just going to start
we're going to go to nuke audiobooks here
I shouldn't chose that one
a cat at the foot of your bed is on fire
you can plug this into your headphone jack auxilary jackal via the headphone jack
in your car and you can listen to stuff that you go
you can buy these in the text
so it's kind of like a filler app
it just it
all it does is trigger a redirect which means it opens up your web browser see
we're on a web browser now and you can do shopping from there
look library is where all your stuff is actually going to be
this will be your books your magazines your little kids books everything
yes swipe left and right you can do all that stuff thank you very much
thanks for the set up
we just set this up so so we're not going to look at page speed because come on guys
it's a tablet
you do have a page animation
so really cool
it's kind of like oh
I'll grab the top corner of the page
don't rip the paper
you know something like that
so yeah it's very cool
in that regard you have text size changes
everything changes live for the most part you have margins line spacing justification
you can push everything to the left box it in the middle and so forth
let's go back to there
oh this one sorry
in that regard you can also press and hold make highlights press and hold and make notes
we're going to make a note just to show you the speed of the typing oops
I screwed that up but the yeah
jump to page add bookmarks find in book view details and settings
it'll be look home so this is where your library will be your Barnes & Noble readouts
just kind of like your feed and then at the bottom
of course
there's shops apartment
so you can go to books you can go to the magazine store specifically romance teens kids and comics
if you want to choose your likes and dislikes you also have various amount of settings on the side
we're not going to go through
every single one of those
this video would be 20 minutes long
nuke shop is where you actually buy your content
I like the way they do this
that's really cool and then everything will just be down here more by this artist
more in the series editorial reviews you can do review and click
what do you think lots of cool stuff here
and it's very intuitive
you can also click free sample if you want to do that
Barnes & Noble
read out
we're going to go back to
Nuuk library because we are going to read People magazine and this is just a preview magazine
so you can click the middle
yeah and that will give you a dual page spread table of contents which is really cool
it's better than just reading the table of contents
like you know what page 45 will be the the ad for this particular thing
we go some sunglasses
well look at some sunglasses
cool you can zoom in on that you can double tap out
I've noticed that say the nuke HD plus the 9.7 sucker the one really big back in the day
that was really good for magazines
this is kind of small even if you compare it against like my experience d3
it's not worlds apart in size so the screen size
it's it's pretty good
I mean it does get the job done and the magazine experience is quite nice on Barnes & Noble
it always has been and yeah
the the tablet itself is capable of a lot of things
3000 milliamp battery is gigantic
it's also expandable up to 128 gigs via SD card
we're wrapping up here so
I'm just going to say this
tablets haven't really pushed themselves since say 2013 2014 when like the Google Nexus 7 came out
that was like when that came out
we're like wow
this is a great tablet since then tablets have kind of caught up with themselves
it's like you know
they're all capable of playing asphalt 8
and all your latest apps and latest games and there's no lag and everything smooth so
they got this cookie cutter black layout they
I haven't changed much in the last little while so
this tablet is really good though
I'm glad they went back they got Android 6.0
quad core dual cameras
I don't really like that
I like the nuke line of tablets but no color the nuke tablets and no cage DD HD
puzzles are fantastic
what do you guys think about this
sorry for the long video
there's a lot to cover for nook stuff trigger e-reader comm this is Peter
a pin display tablet
it's a monitor that needs to be connected to a computer to work
it doesn't work on its own
it's not like normal tablets
it feels quite spacious gama
it's a little over a kilo which is quite light
it has a good amount of keys
you can use and set up as shortcuts in there is also a rotating
you just need to be loft a protective layer
that's always so satisfying suiting to do like
I love peeling off labels and stuff like that
it comes with a stand
that's pretty small and compact it can be adjusted from 14 degrees to 45 degrees
it's a very simple stand and it works very simply but it's a little difficult to change the angle
why the tablet is on the stand because in order to change the inclination of the tablet
you need to know what's happening in the back
there are no screw holes so even if you want to install one of those permanent stand
you can't do it because you can't screw it in
that's a little bit of a boomer
but you know the concept of this tablet is portability so I I can accept that
and because of the portability concept the tablet comes with a pouch and it looks very good
it's very nice
it's grey outside and orange inside
which are the common colors
so it's good but it's a little tight
the pen is the classic camel pen design
it hasn't changed at all
it has 8,192 pressure levels
you're gonna need them because
Gambel pen nibs get worn out pretty easily
I don't know if it depends on the screen protector or the tip itself
maybe it's too soft
I don't know a thing you like a lot about
this tablet is that they reduce a lot
the amount of wires a usually gamin pen display tablet
have more wires than this
so it's nice that they reduced them so it's great for portability
it's very nice
it's a cool touch
do we sell the tablet
you just need to go through their website
the installation process is pretty straightforward
you have to press for a few seconds
the last key on the left side to adjust those settings you need to use the keys on the right side
took me a while to figure that out the ring
you're using and one makes you scroll up and down
I really really like this
the layers of the display are glued together
the lamination of this screen is really good the parallax it's barely noticeable
it's amazing unfortunately
Gangwon cursor position is not 100% accurate
it has improved a lot over time and because of the illumination is not very noticeable
but it's not 100% precise and it's worth mentioning that
the pen is very responsive as always and alike
it's not so much considering that
I have a very old laptop as you might know
that doesn't work really well because of that
I only know that by default this comes in the worm color profile setup and I changed it to srgb
the color should be quite accurate
anyway because this has an IPS full HD screen with an idiot % NTSC color gamut
so it should be pretty accurate
what you saw
before was the comparison between the other fifteen point six inches display tablet
I like the other stand better but I like to stab lit more because it's laminated it's more precise
I'm trying to simplify my style
I am trying to experiment with ways of coloring especially digitally
because that's the only thing
I'm using right now
I'm basically only drawing digitally lately
can you believe that
I haven't made a watercolor illustration since the beginning of the year
hey can you believe that it's crazy anyway
I made so many mistakes
the light source
it's so unclear and
I think I worked everything at the end
it looks a little creepy
not gonna lie
this is not how
it looks like it just made a mistake and I mean Anatomy
it's also something after practice on
let's be honest
I feel quite confident about the female torso but everything else
it's a very foggy
I don't remember anything of that
I've never started
I always forget everything
also you know guy said his channel started with me only making
the problem is that I forgot everything in you
that's it for this video
thank you so much for watching and I hope you're all safe
wherever in the world you are take care of yourself and the people around you and bye-bye guys
in our last episode we gave the BRZ some more grip with a sticky set of Zini
srt-6 kay tires now
it's time to add some more power for this
we sought out open flash performance
also we like that
we could flash the car back to 100% stock at any time for a dealer
headers for a stock card
that you just want to run on e85
you'd use the stage 2 equal length header tune
we decided to start off with the stage
1 tune writing a tune to your vehicle takes about 5 minutes
all you do is select the tune
check out that link in the description
let's talk about how the stage 1 tune feels immediately
we notice the engine to be smoother all throughout the rev band and at idle
we were pleasantly surprised
at how much more linear the
driving experience
really this is how we think the BRZ should feel from the factory
the only audible difference
but it's very brief and much improved over stock on the stock tune
it used to be a real buzzkill accelerating out of corners with that dip in the power
and that's no longer the case overall
we'd say we're really happy with the car just on the stage one two
it does provide a much more enjoyable driving experience
all right bonding 85
negative on the tablet
then pull over and flash the ECU to the e85 tune
it's an easy process and only takes about 10 minutes
so you're breaking even if not saving money at the pump
to put it through its paces
we're going to be uploading some more
POV test drive footage in the coming weeks of our BRZ on the e85 and stage 1 tunes
it's our first time drifting ever so go easy on us
TV project BRZ with its newfound horsepower
the car is really well balanced with a level of power and grip that it has project
BRZ is probably nearing its completion
we've just turned up a couple notches
that's it for this episode
thanks again for watching everyone
we'll see you next time you you
hi my name is Ashley
now you may think that because he's got a mobile processor
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how fast the laptop actually is
so that can be used once
you both know that
Safari the vga
hdmi displayport so unfortunately this one there is no wired
Ethernet port so if you do need why these nets you have to buy some sort of USB adapter for it
Boots's straight into windows ready feeding used so there we go
how fast and there we go
you're at your Windows desktop so it comes with Windows 10 professional
obviously this is a latitude
so it's a business spec laptop so if you need to it can be joined to a domain
I looked not much of work
you'll be able to see that it is very fast
it loads within seconds again we can use the touchscreen
Windows 10 do you want the tournament's tablet mode
I don't usually bother with that so again if we open up Microsoft Word the keyboard
so this way will rotate with you
it can be used as a replacement for a laptop
it's very fast
if you have any questions or comments please post them in the comments box
not happy to answer them
thanks for watching
hi everyone this is david from geek enoyed
Scott at UK today
I'm bringing you a review of the Wacom Bamboo fun pen and touch
graphics tablet now
you've got this little grip area on the side here where you can slide your pen in there
so that's nice and handy for keeping the pen in a secure place all the times
you're not going to lose it
and as well as the active area here for controlling your cursor on the screen you also get four
Express keys here
I'm going to be showing you on screen
how you can configure the tablet and then how it actually works so first of all
let's look at the system preferences for this bamboo pen and touch tablet now
we can configure the buttons on the pen the eraser feel double-click distance etc
and then we can configure the tablet itself either left or right-handed use
I've got it orientated
for right hand juice with my Express keys on the left hand side here and they're not going to
I can actually configure what each button does at
it still work with the pain but just won't accept a touch input
then this second button here
I can configure the touch speed
you can tap with one finger as I've been doing already
you can even add
I was on so very useful for actually navigating around a browser
now let's pop into iPhoto and here
I've got some photos
I'm viewing so I can double click to view this photo
it takes a little bit of getting used to that first
rotate gesture wasn't recognized
I'm going to select my paint
brush here and here
I'm painting on the canvas here
I can actually press lightly to get a thin line or increase the pressure to get a thick line now
I'm no artist so I'm not going to do anything too fancy here but I just wanted to show you that
it is usable as a proper graphics tablet as well
I've been very impressed with the bamboo
Thunderer pen and touch features in one device is a very welcome addition
then you're going to pay around about 155 pounds
well thank you very much for listening
this is bottom in my review of the
Wacom Bamboo fun pen and touch
come back soon and check out more reviews and geek annoyed scout UK
this video review is sponsored by crucial the memory experts they provide reliable
PC notebook and Mac memory to boost your system performance and improve your general workflow
recently I was contacted by a spokesperson from a company called Galman
they offered to send me a free fancy-pantsy tablet in order to review it
doing a basic review wasn't really gonna cut it for me so instead
let's see how this goes
here's the thing though
I already redesigned S&T twice
this is her modern version
which in itself is a redesign of the old version and this is the perfect redesign which
Mon PD 1560 screen tablet this is the first time I've ever used a screen tablet in my life
so it's quite the upgrade from my huion h6n pro the gigantic package
I got came with the tablet
I really appreciate because I'm bad
I think I'm finally ready to start
the goal is to make flaming knuckles a little more unique first
I started by pulling his dreads into a ponytail
speaking of fire safety
I decided to turn his gloves into heat-resistant gloves like how firefighters or fry cooks use
a sort of angular pattern then
I started incorporating the angular pattern into other parts of the design knuckles as ancestors
have these sort of markings on their face and dreads dr.
here's a character design tip
voila the sketch is done
I started with the basics
you know red fur a slightly darker tan muzzle
I made the Lego base and the shackles a sort of silvery gray
has this sort of ombre effect going with the eyes so I played with that idea and I liked it a lot
and here's the final product
I think this turned out really cool
working fairly decently from what
I've heard this is actually kind of normal with screen tablets anyway
I also really like how this doubles as a second monitor it makes it very easy to stream
I actually did stream with this not too long ago and I had no problems with it
it worked perfectly all in all
I'm definitely going to use this tablet way more often
if you're looking for a good screen tablet
that isn't too heavy on your wallet
if you're interested
I left links in the description of where you can buy it
I hope you guys enjoyed this redesign - if I get another sponsorship like this
that has nothing to do with any sponsorship
some of you might actually already know what it might be
I hope you look forward to that and I'll see you guys later
hey guys it's neon and I'm here with pinky boo
but the thing about this one is
it's very budget-conscious
it's very budget-friendly
this is a $399 tablet
we're gonna unbox it galette
pinky boo do the unboxing
then we're gonna do some art
yep let's flip this over there we go okay
what comes that little hard
let's see here there
we go there we go
let's get started like the walking one to your computer
install the way is drive and register your tablet
so let's see what we got in the box
alright yep this is oh that's white
yeah why don't you take it you all compared to the other ones yeah
well we're gonna get pinky boo using this tablet
you've actually never used
yeah let's see here so
I don't know this is a yes stylus is
this is the clips
chargin okay lots of wires
so we're all going to hook this up
there's our instructions we're gonna hook this unit up yeah
I like how they hide their the head
let's do a size comparison of the wacom one
this is the wacom one
this is my 13-inch Cintiq
it's very sturdy but it is plastic
let me turn this over here and you can see on the back here that you know
it's close to get sturdy
I mean it is very sturdy
compare this to the 13-inch
Cintiq which again we're talking a $399 unit versus an $800 unit and you can see this is metal
that's something that we do not have on the
Wacom one however
I don't think it's a loss not for the price now hooking up the Wacom one is very very simple
I really like these these new cables
it's kind of an all-in-one cable and let me show this to you
this actually they do include an AC adapter but I love this because these smaller tablets
I use them on my laptop there's one two and then the the HDMI right
and then look at this
there's one connector
I just plug it in like that and I'm good to go very easy to connect
this is probably the easiest tablet
I've ever connected to a computer before
so there is that
they had laptops of mind
it's very very easy to connect this tablet to your computer now
you're probably wondering how it performs it performs like a
Wacom which is good right
I mean for $399
I'm very impressed with the performance of this tablet again
it's not very big but it is a great tablet to have like
I mean even though this unit is made of plastic
it's it's very sturdy
you can definitely you know
put some weight on this and it's it's not gonna budge but look at the performance
you know it's it's a wacom
there's no there's no jitter you know
it really doesn't get any better than this you know
I've yet to find another brand that performs quite like like a Wacom
does you know there's zero jitter that even when you're zipping right along
let's pick a little watercolor here and see what we can do
you know it's now talk about the tech specs here in a minute or two but sensitivity is great like
I said it performs just like bigger wacom unit for a fraction of the price
I mean I think this is probably the most affordable Wacom tablet on the market
now we're gonna be doing some drawing
I'll show you some of the drawings that we did and pinky boo is gonna be doing some drawing too
this is actually her first time ever using a tablet so this should be pretty interesting
okay guys so
we're gonna do some drawing with pinky boo
she's actually it's the first time she's used a digital art tablet and this is a good tablet for
I think for beginners for students
and she's gonna do some drawing here in clip studio
yeah you want to pick a pencil
so let's um let's pick
yeah there's so we got real pencil here that's it
this is in the clip studio
so they're your real pencil
yep so you can change different tools
so does it feel like like you're drawing for real
it's actually yeah it's a one thing
I like about the walk comes is you can push a little bit harder
you can make the pencil blood bigger if you want it
yeah see if you push harder you can necessarily draw on for real and
I think I mentioned it before
is that the stylus on
they'd be here neither ways
no pressure no pressure chalk
that hasn't mean that it feels like actual pencil right
yeah it does but I'm just like not used to it because my pencils are very pigmented
yeah well you didn't actually use the pencils whole white color pencil
you can blend stuff
I don't know what pose I'm trying to do here
I'm just like mixing him all together
nice thing about this because Peggy B
who's never worked digitally before well
oh well the nice thing about this though is you can actually work in layers so you can draw it
they do and you can you know
Photoshop actually works really good in this too
Oh what
I've noticed that I knew dude
I don't know why it just I'm so bad then like I'm not gonna that's why you'll see is actually
I know I do have one
that's a cue
this is well now
she looks like she's from
Steven universe he's new thread jiminy
Lilly okay guys
I'm going to wrap this up
I drew this 100% on the wacom one tablet that I used to draw a Disney comics professionally
it's first time
um final thoughts yeah
I think it's a really good tablet for the price
it does start at $399 for a
Wacom screen tablet
that's incredibly cheap
the performance is great
it's what you would expect from
Wacom the pen pressure as I understand
it is 4096 levels
the tilt angle support is 60 degrees
I know those of you out there
want to know those numbers those specs
it is a 13.3
inch display
it does not support
I was very confused
I didn't realize this unit didn't have an eraser I want to erase
I also own a 13-inch Wacom Cintiq tablet 8g tablet and the performance is comparable
I think it's it's pretty much identical
it's made of metal but that doesn't mean that the one is cheap
it doesn't feel cheap in fact it feels sturdier than some of the more expensive off-brand tablets
I purchased in the past again for $399
you're getting a pretty good tablet
I mean you're getting a really good tablet
it is walking so you know you're gonna get the performance that you want
it's very very easy to hook up
it's very light
you can slip this unit into a laptop bag and take it with you like
I said it hooks up fantastically in my laptop
it's a great portable option personally
I like drawing on a bigger screen
but if you're on the go
I just hook it in the laptop and I'm ready to go um it's a great unit for students
you know pinky boo she's 12
it's definitely for the money
it's a buy for me again
I think it's a great entry point now
i think it's a great starting point
Wacom tablet I recommend it
I'll put a link in the description
you can buy one if you're interested
great little unit actually exceeded my expectations again
the price point is fantastic for
Wacom if you're looking for more art and animation videos subscribe to clownfish animation

I've been enjoying the experience
they're calling it
it's got some good improvements over the previous version
I had a chance to hang on to it for a couple of weeks and this is what I found
Amazon's Fire HD 8 is a small tablet
plus you can add more it
lets you do a lot of things like read ebooks
listen to audio books watch streaming
this tablet runs
I'm in the middle of watching Bosch on prime video and it hooked me up with the last episode
I was watching after that
you can download other apps as you wish the button
placements are all along the top of the device
there are some changes and improvements over the previous versions
none of which
I've personally had a chance to try
the price has increased
yes over the fire seven but you are getting a bit of a bigger device
HD storage has been increased as well
but where it had one gig of ram before it's now about one and a half things like battery
life has also increased from about 8 hours to about 12 hours
the speaker has been improved going from a single mono speaker to a dual dolby
atmos speaker which we'll talk about in a little bit
the screen is ok just ok
I cranked it up to full but even then I thought it could have used a bit more brightness power
I'm going to switch over now and show you a little about the camera on the Fire HD
this is it
you're looking at video
shot with it right now so
so there's a bit of an improvement there now
the camera has had some tweaks made to it though
that are coming out
this is an amazing feature to have and is sure to come in handy for you to capture some memories
the audio quality on the tablet is good
fortunately the headphone
jack means
you shouldn't have to
this tablet comes loaded with apps and productivity tools
there's a web browser called silk email maps contacts calendar calculator
so you can download other apps you might want
to connect to a PC or Macintosh computer or to charge your device with the included power
adapter there's also a microSD slot for external storage
and when it comes to audio you have that three-and-a-half millimeter headphone jack
it'll take slightly longer
if you use other power adapters that you may already have lying around
and that's supposed to give you about 12 hours of battery life now
I didn't do the whole drain the battery test
I used it on and off over about two weeks and really only had to charge it twice
you'll see the app on the tablet and you can click on it to open it up but nothing works yet
I've really come to rely on Alexa most of all when it comes to smart digital assistants
the tablet comes preloaded with audible for audiobooks
I hope that changes soon
I'm not sure if that's an Amazon issue or an audible issue but it is also mildly disappointing
now while we're on the subject of things the tablet can't do yet show mode also doesn't work in
something else unfortunately
the tablet doesn't do yet is video calling for video calling to work on this device you need
Alexa to function and annoyingly
I can actually see my Fire HD tablet inside the Alexa app on my iPhone
but it just shows as offline so again
I hope the Alexa issue is resolved soon
so all these fun and helpful features can finally be taken advantage of here in Canada overall
I was really surprised by how much I liked this tablet
well this tablet definitely doesn't have some of the capabilities of something like an iPad pro
it is also much less expensive
you're definitely going to pay for it
you may already have getting the all new
Fire HD 8 is a no brainer
you can read more about it online at tech gadgets
Canada com I've got a full write-up there
I hope everyone out there can watch and enjoy
I'm Erin you can find me on Twitter or Instagram until the next video
I'm at Erin lyy see
hello and welcome together media
I'm grant Abbott and today
I'm reviewing the huion H s 64 so hurry on
maybe students maybe as students
they're very similar to the Huey on the ug the XP pen and gammon and other brands are out there
generally speaking if you go for one of those sort of five brands you're absolutely fine
with the graphics tablets
the drivers they're updated regularly and they should be fine to work with most of your systems
please don't contact me if they don't work though
I did actually have to go back and reinstall my Wacom drivers after I'd use this though
it all worked really smoothly out of the box
it seems to work straight away the one thing I couldn't test was the pressure sensitivity
it didn't seem to work in my sort of galaxy
LPI blah blah blah
they're all the same really to be honest
I've worked with graphics
tablets that have 2000 levels of pressure sensitivity and
are they happy with the product
do the drivers work
and you'll be fine
Wacom screen in the background there
it's slightly more tricky to draw on to a smaller surface
I'm very impressed
it's a really good graphics tablet
it's very comfortable to use
I don't know about the Ducks personally
but maybe you like that sort of thing but in terms of price this is fantastic
one of the cheaper stuff seen at around 30 pound $30
so it's a really good buy anyway
I hope that helps
and thanks to huion for sending me the tablet
thanks for watching
crossover from lenovo
that you've all been asking me about the lenovo duet chromebook
let's talk display
we've got a 10.1
inch 1900 by 1200 display on
this and
i was really surprised by this
it's vibrant
it's colorful it gets surprisingly bright at 372 nits and it
plus now
you're gonna be very impressed if i had to give the display a bad mark here at all
let's talk power
we've got this mediatek processor again
i could run a few videos
i can play games
even then i
i still think it performs better than you'd expect from those specs
let's talk battery
we've got a little bit of battery magic here
today i got 12 hours out of this device 12 out of a tiny little tablet again
is this not a good piece
so of course i went to see if others in earlier reviews this year and experienced this
and guess what there's great news for you
it actually looks like a lot of the other reviewers shared my experience
so let's talk input methods
it's you know
it just isn't great
it's really really cramped
that my co-producer and i just keep joking that they shouldn't have even put it on the keyboard
it's not very responsive
i will mention the lenovo
duet chromebook does support usi style styluses
that's a tongue twister
but the one that i ordered actually did not arrive prior to this video
if not i will not do anything
we've got two cameras on here
i just recently reviewed
maybe you saw the entire series
uh now of course
let's talk about the speakers
there are speakers they produce some sound and that is all that's same
let's talk form factor and build
i actually think the build of this device is pretty cool
it's like sturdy
i love love that all the accessories are magnetic like the keyboard
of course
not uh the back case and the kickstand here that's also magnetic and sticks to the back
i think they did a really really great job of that and i think overall the one thing
i think you'll all agree with me on
let's talk ports
i know you only come here for the incredible sense of humor
i have so i guess
this is the part where i make an awful joke about this
only having port singular
uh yeah there's just a usbc port on here for charging data transfer and so on
i couldn't do that
i will mention
lenovo does include a little
you know dongle adapter so you can plug headphones into it
but that adapter goes into the usbc port
here's my final word
if you made it this far it means that you like the content
you probably like me too much weird so come on and give me a subscribe and like the video as well
send me a comment
whatever so that i can go home and just smile all week long
here's the deal
the price point is awesome
however if you can afford that many devices that are frivolous like that
i am very very impressed with this overall
i think we're all a little bit surprised that this came out so great so seriously
congratulations to lenovo
and if you're looking for something in this budget end i can't recommend this enough okay
everyone so that's the end of the review
you know what to do now
and here's what we've got coming up next
you're excited about it
this is the part of the video where i go
what do you want to see
what do you want me to talk about
what questions do you have about this device
thank you as always for watching and i'll see you next time
i had to make you wait
welcome back everyone today
I want to take a look at this
little pipo w2s tablet
that was sent in to me by my friends at gearbest
thank you very much gearbest as you can see
it says window on the back end of the tablet but it's actually got android on it as well
let's go over a few specifications of it for you
the pipo w2s has an 8 inch screen as 1920 by 1200 pixels display
L the 8 inch screen is 283 PPI and it is an IPS
capacitive touchscreen - guys
okay so it's just have a bit of an update today
oh here we go
we're restarting already
that was quick
Pipo mine go into Android Pipo Android
okay so here we are in the Android settings storage and you can see there
it says total space 3.8 seven gigabytes as opposed to what if it was 29 in
Windows this thing is pretty fragmented in the way
they've installed everything onto the hard drive
well the internal drive
I mean not the hard drive
it doesn't have a hard drive and it is as e
Windows 10 again on the power dialog here we've got boot to Windows so simply touch
that ok will boot into Windows and where we go okay
so we're back into Windows again
then let's find out what we're looking for here
then hopefully disk management
well here we are in the disk map windows
so that's where you can recover the tablet from which
is there not not necessary at all
it's a nice little tablet
actually it runs quite quickly there
we go it runs quite quickly
you've got things like the Microsoft edge here as you can see it boots through quite quickly
it's quite nice actually
here is the little tablet on gear bests own site and you can see
it's 86 pounds 80 pence at the moment
you can't get it in black it's available while it looks things
at least it will be from the 16th of April to the 18th of April so I guess they only get
I mean you know so many at a time
it's very easy to close windows down like the browser
just drag it from the top like so in a way it goes what we got down here
I believe it's got USB 3 in the side here yes you have USB 3 just here we've got HDMI
this is a mini
HDMI and a mini USB
there's one of the cameras we have a
here are the accessories you get with it
don't really need this charger because you can actually use any standard
USB charger that you've got kicking about that will do it as well when I first received this
from the guys at gearbest it had a fairly outdated
Windows 10 on it
it wasn't the latest of what is the other 1701 or something
the latest one or 17 11 is the latest operating system so
it does make it very very difficult to be honest with you guys
I'll show you how I had to do it
I had to use this multi port USB adapter thing here in one of the ports
I had to find it via the file server
you won't see it on any because it's not plugged in but you had to file it by that
I think there are a few updates
Windows actually to be honest with you
it's let's try this
I don't try this so paint 3d yet
here it comes here we go so you can start a new project
it seems to run alright on here so oops
can we get rid of it
yes we can there
it goes back to the desktop again
we've got the file server open as well
there we go they just shows you
you've got six point
seven one gigabytes of free space on a nineteen point seven gigabytes all right
let's take a look at the camera then
so this is the stills side of things and we can take his snap so
I can see what it's like
there we go
I think you can also tap focus it we also got video video available to us
I hopefully you can see it
ticking off down the bottom here
this is recording the video for us
I've just taken guys taking off down the bottom here
this is recording the video force
you just got a little loan there
we go
that's all your programs
desktop thing here okay
what you're used to using
will you ref programs so you got the choice
there tablet mode or proper desktop
you know shortcuts
it works well enough for me
I've got my favorite magazine installed on here
Guns & Ammo read that regularly
it's it's a nice little tablet
it's quite small and compact
let's compare it with a 10 inch my 10 inch as you can see
Windows apps on here as well guys the same ones you got in the computer you can
this was a a bit of a hybrid
you've got one small enough to actually plug in to the little pepo
alright let's plug it in and give it a go there we go
it's just a long press and there it
you can also run this little tablet as a proper PC with a keyboard
I've got this little Bluetooth keyboard connected up here
there we go
we're in right
let's have a look for gearbest
then we'll hit the enter key
hopefully we should be off then to gearbest there we are
Geir best comm or wherever you like
really soon as they sent us the little tablets
was we better check their website out so it will actually run like your ordinary desktop computer
so you can only know this is only a small little bluetooth keyboard
I've got here because of a larger one
they're a little small laptop which should be quite good
I'd say this is just
this is running quite nicely off of this little
Bluetooth keyboard here but there are some larger ones and much better ones out there
I'm thinking they're getting one
that's more or less the same size as this
we were the larger keys
and whatever you on it which would be a lot easier to operate
so you've got a choice you can either use it by touch like this here or as
yeah well so there we go okay guys
I hope you enjoyed taking a look at this
little pipo tablet with me today
it's quite a nice little bit of kid
actually it runs quite quickly as I say you can run ordinary Windows programs with it
it'll still work the same for you guys for a future project for this
whichever you like alright guys
I enjoyed the review
if you did please feel free to subscribe
that would help my channel as well
you can follow me on my
just look for the how to support my channel
I've got a couple of guys already helping me there
so thank you very much so to those two guys
okay guys well thanks for popping over
thanks for watching and I will catch you here again at Rathbone Manor in the very near future then
oh and by the way
I tried to get back to everyone but sometimes a your queries and questions do actually slip by me
Android tablet
remove the box out of the way and here we go this is it
there's no problem there as you can see and obviously it moves around as well
let me just unlock it all right so we're unlocked you've got all the usual things before
I go into the child
lock down one
Authority for the Wi-Fi back on again
where's my wife
I'm not working
it was working earlier on hence they at the time and everything
I'll just had to gone network
no there we go
I'm all joined on it right
okay thanks a lot of stuff so as you can see up here
but it's only about two
Meg even not mistaken so could be better bought again
this is a child's tablet
obviously this is where it's aimed so let's just come out of there
it's already got a pre-loaded audio thing for you just to see screens
the screens really quite good for that
so if you're if you're going to be putting things onto the SD card or anything like that
a few children to watch video of that
that's good as well so again for you as the parent
you've got your browser fully fresh fully fledged browser there
let's go back
just go through all those
you've got your music normal setting is for Android flow those to your heart's content
you can download whatever you want if I just go back to the main screen though so this is the kids
desktop already
setting off for my child saw this
Jensen there if you go into it
he hasn't put anything in yet
but you can put books games video
you can put anything you want in and the main thing is you can have
you've got two children you can have it
let's go back if you've got two children thing
so there's a pin to come out of it which is probably the best thing or you can answer a question
it'll take you back if you get it right once obviously
I didn't get it right
that time 63 okay right and then you batch you screen so TF card slot this way set expandable
you've got your micro
they're all in all for a child
fantastic for you to pick up and play with many trials an avenue
there'd be no problem there but all-in-all $37.99 an excellent
Buy and the specs of it are a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core processor
you've got a 1024 by 600 pixels screen and one gig of ram eight gig hard drive
obviously expandable with the micro
USB card micro SD card
sorry the front camera is 0.3
megapixel and the rear is 2 megapixels or not the best but it is for children great schüttler
this is kind of how the box looks so
keep on watching okay so this is in the box
it comes with a little card and then the tablet which i'm about to see it's exciting okay
it feels like a nice weight not too heavy not too light
i like it
okay so this is the tablet outside of the box
it is very sleek
it's actually very light
you can find it on amazon for fifty to sixty dollars
i've seen the prices change a few dollars here and there
this is the pen that it comes with on the side of the pen
this will connect the tablet to your comp
the tablet comes with eight preset hard keys but you could always change what the keys stand for
and this is the size comparison with the tablet
just connect the cable from the tablet to the computer
and it's on
there's no on or off button
this is the app that huion comes with
that is doable
in this tablet
this is where you would do that
click on the lock and give the huion tablet permission and then it will work
after i opened the tablet but i was wrong
it was really hard to use
my computer was very laggy as you can see
it was on five percent so that was probably another reason
why but i couldn't figure it out
it was really hard
i couldn't do the homework simon so i ended up just taking it out and just using my track
it took me forever
it wasn't perfect at all
don't give up
it just takes some practice and you'll feel more natural using the tablet after a while
so that's what i did
when i was coloring
i feel way more comfortable and i could do that online
better and faster than i did in this time lapse so yes just practice
it takes practice
but don't just throw your tablet away and get mad and cry that it didn't work right away
i also was having trouble because i haven't used photoshop too much
i'm not super experienced with it
this is how the final outcome came
i think it turned out
you can also connect to your phone if you have an android
i'm pretty sure
the cursor is only visible on some devices like on the galaxy note
so if you have that this might be a great option
also keep in mind if you connect it to your phone
you're not going to be able to use the whole tablet workspace to draw
only a portion of the tablet
it is a great size it is very cheap and it works on multiple softwares like photoshop
um indesign premiere you can use it
on mouse you can use it on sketchbook ebs pane etc
alright guys well
that's it for today's video slash review
i hope you all enjoyed it
hey guys here
what makes this tablet really
unique is the fact that it's heavily commercialized
so you can purchase it at basically any electronics store
otherwise lepen tablet PC is a pretty generic device in terms of specs
it has a 1 gigahertz
ARM Cortex processor
5 new 12 megabytes of RAM 2 gigabytes of ROM upgradeable via a microSD card slot
this is actually the exact
actually used the same charger is a little bit shady to be honest now
lepen is actually a manufacturer
we haven't heard a lot of here in the United United States and the TC
970 is actually the first device
the tablet itself which is very reflective is a huge fingerprint
Brendon lanyard cord and a squirrel like traveling AC adapter
it's made out of glass in the front and the size of ice are embezzled
I can scratch a little bit more easier and attracts a little more smudges than usual
here you can see the serious speakers which are very loud
is it hold switch a volume rocker as long as a micro
SD card slot be hidden behind a cover
and that's pretty much
there's nothing on the bottom
you notice that the screen is extremely vibrant
and it's easy to read
the main thing you'll notice about the screen is also the fact it has a 178 degree
viewing angle
this is very impressive
and so this allows you to actually see the tablet
now this is good because in darker environments
it's gonna light up
you have the browser the calendar the camera Google Maps of course in Gmail
and that's basically it
the wifely reception is also pretty strong suits
some other aspects to take note of is the fact again that the webcam here actually has a 720p
now for some weird reason even though the device does have a 2 gigabyte
which is another counterintuitive aspect
but again you can see here
we can shoe up to 720p
the camera does a really nice job
the left hand tablet does a pretty nice job
it's just a smartphone operating system being stretched onto a larger screen
and you'll see that on a lot of different applications
and so it's a good tablet
just click on that and see how fast it loads now over
Wi-Fi it is pretty speedy as far as the reception goes
and hopefully it's gonna load here
it doesn't have only three axes but actually all four axes which is pretty impressive
it can also see here cup
see here that multi-touch is also a pretty smooth experience overall
well most likely it's also going to be available here
otherwise device is a pretty generic tablet
nothing really to write home about the
a fro device was released so unfortunately it remains sukkah
Android 2.2 however one aspect where the pen did upgrade is the Android Marketplace to the Play
Store application
this allows you to actually ask access
that's out of an Apple iPad or HP TouchPad
it's a very impressive display
if you're gonna be again browsing the web or viewing content
we're watching videos again
reading ebooks is another area where the device will excel at some other things to take note of
we also liked how the controls on the side of the device
Lipan tablet and we found that for the most part
that didn't search well
Lipan tablet pc and there we go
the pan
has this very unique aspect ratio
we haven't really seen in any other tablet
PC running Android OS because unlike sits unlike the resolution of sixteen by nine
impressive and the device is actually quite hefty
PC if you want to learn more about the Lipan TC 970 producer a full review here os VTX recom
this has been our video first look
the 8-inch Walmart tablet has an IPS display with a resolution of 1280 by 800
which is the latest commercial availability
Android q is not really out yet
some beta but this device has a lot going for it
that doesn't just take up space
so that's the major things there this is a generic
Android tablet so
you're not gonna get any skinned experiences like the Amazon fire devices
the barnes & noble devices
Samsung devices this one is going to be completely bare
you see you have an apps button to show you
what kind of apps are running right now
you have the home and the back but there's actually the Walmart logo on the bottom right there
and other things you can also check nearby stores and prices by putting in your zip code
currently all of the geolocation stuff the shopping the grocery everything else is based on the US
you select all the food items
grab your food and away you go
the Sam's Club app is basically a subsidiary of Walmart
it's the same company it's kind of like the Costco of Walmart
it's more wholesale based and you can add things to your cart here all the same
sometimes there's a little sticker on it and it'll give you a digital code
you go online and there you go you have a digital copy via the
Vudu app so last year
Kobo app
I got it again
once you do you get four different highlights
you can make notes by typing on the keyboard
you can also bookmark at the top little page curls over to show
you made a bookmark
yeah so you can buy books on this device
you're not kind of like locked out to purchases that you've already made but you can see
ebooks new releases
this is more or less the type of interface that
Kobo has like on their main website
so they have basically a mobile version tapping into their website
so that's the home
Kobo's like writing competition
we don't have four speakers or even two
there's just the single on the back but the volume capacity is quite good
and you didn't get that kind of crackling
you get when something's really loud
yeah it's actually not too bad very surprising
this is a digital comic on the comiXology app
this really gives you a sense on the vibrancy of the screen
so it's pretty respectable you know for the value
that's not looking too bad
the reds are red
the blacks are actually pretty black
you don't see those kind of fuzzy
Gray's when you look at a black spot yeah so this is guided view
it sort of just isolates the specific frames
there's worse things in the world that you can spend sixty four dollars on you could be a
Fein like me and spend that on microtransactions on games or you can invest in this Walmart tablet
I feel that with Google Play in conjunction with all the Walmart core apps and Android 9.0
this is all this is worth it
I mean you're not with bleeding edge specs here but two gigs of ram quad core processor
this is going to perform super
well you're not gonna really kind of get like a full
HD experience watching Netflix
you're not gonna get like a 2k or 4k experience you know watching like you know
Amazon Prime video and things like that but this is a great low cost tablet that is powerful
that does a lot of things
Discordian to experience with this so I rated a bye
this video is sponsored by Squarespace
dude everybody's using the iPad pro nail artist is I would god Rafi stop
let's find out by the end of this
I'm probably gonna regret this
I have a sketch
I want to draw something that I might use in a comic book page
I don't want this piece to be just okay
I want it to be good enough to show in my portfolio
fortunately today's sponsor
Squarespace makes that super easy
they're so easy to customize they make a great starting point for whatever you want to create
I like the fiddle so I really like that
I could jump in and get really granular with the design
okay first
I need to find a really cheap tablet
I've got it narrowed down to two
I found this one it's a little hooey on
it is only twenty dollars so
I was a bad noise
alright here we go we got am
I going to do a full review of this tablet
ah you know what
here's my review
don't slam it against your desk
eight out of ten
what are we gonna find in the box
let's open it up
this is the tiniest tablet
I have ever seen I am just gonna gently
lay you off to the side
I might want to get a pillow now
this also comes with some other things
mostly these are just the instructions
we're gonna have to go online and find the drivers also pen
nibs wear out
these are tiny
so we've got our tablet
we've got our pen
I I think we're ready to go here first thing
that's also very expensive
it's 50 60 bucks a month
if you can't afford that totally understand
the live space on the graphics tablet
which is the actual area that you're drawing in is 4 inches wide and about 2.2 inches deep
it's a little bit bigger than a credit card
I'd say about a third bigger than a credit card
so that gives you the idea of how small of an area
you're drawing it
I draw a line if I draw a tiny little line on this tablet
I did to offset that is in my drawing program eyes oome the way in
I don't think that's bad advice
zooming in isn't bad at all
the other thing that happens on a smaller tablet like this is
I wasn't sure what I was doing and if I had to go back and use this as say import folio piece
I would probably erase the first couple
they did especially the lines on that character
a lot of the new stuff that's coming out has way more than that has like 8000 levels of pressure
and if you just look at those numbers you might think wow is that enough but I can
I remember when the original surface pro 3 came out and had the pen with it
that was ok so
I wouldn't let 2,000 levels of pressure sensitivity dissuade you
there was plenty of pressure for what
I needed to do now once I got to the colouring phase
I found it to be a lot easier now
part of that is at this point
I just don't have to be as accurate
I don't exactly want it to look like a silhouette perfectly
my hand was pretty tired
I'm used to drawing on the larger screen again
I wouldn't know that this wasn't done on an iPad or larger Cintiq tablet
I hope that helps to know a lot of you
I wanted to thank you guys for watching to the end
I really appreciate it and I'll see you in a couple of days
so the Galman PD
1560 is a middle-of-the-road pen display drawing tablet in terms of price features and size
Galman and I got into contact with each other about me
my horizons outside of cubing videos
plus getting my hands on a really nice
drawing tablet for free sounded pretty appealing
I accepted the deal and had them send me the tablet to review it arrived
I opened it and then I sat around like a huge derp for the next few months
we got the adjustable stand a protection bag
I actually misplaced when I moved into my apartment
eight replacement pen nibs which are stored in the pen holder
is that the screen protector
that comes with the tablet is bubbly
you might say blue
you need to pressure the bubbles out
just just just rub them out just rub them out
just rub them out man
what are you doing what are you doing
just take a credit card and rub them out
dude it's super easy
all you have to do is just rub them out
it would only take like 10 seconds
you just have to go ahead and do it
ma'am ha ha
you might say that but nope you're wrong
I've tried a lot for months
they're here to stay the screen
protector itself feels awesome
it has a paper like sturdy feeling
I'm confident that I can scratch at it as hard as I can
and nothing bad will happen definitely a lot more secure than no protector at all
just keep in mind
the button programming interface is also convenient to use
you just select the button
the stand that it comes with can adjust from nearly flat to just about 90 degrees
it's sturdy and holds the tablet firmly in place under pressure
the pen itself feels really satisfying against the screen protector
not really anything to complain about here
so how does the tablet perform during actual use
you may be asking well from my personal experience
and that's cool
now bear in mind that my actual artistic abilities are not good they are bad
I am unworthy of this
this tablet is capable of creating so much better art than I am capable of making
this tablet is super overpowered for anything that I do with it overall
this tablet is good
I'd give this tablet a solid thumbs up recommendation
hello and welcome to
Gama media I'm grant Abbott and today I'm looking at the XP pen Decco Pro medium
so it's quite a pricey tablet coming in at
I believe the price is a hundred and thirty pounds
let's take a quick look
it is nice
I've got to say straight off the bat
it is a nice piece of kit this
it is the best tablet that I've ever used
so maybe it's worth that price tag
it's got a really really nice surface
it's just a tactile enough to sort of
it's just because we're used to it
it's got a very very nice feeling
maybe it's even better than drawing on paper in some weird way but it was very fluid
very nice it's got
oh it boasts all the pressure sensitivity 8,000 levels response rate and so forth
I've ever used now
it was kind of instant on my screen
if that makes sense it just felt right and natural and it was really fluid
absolutely fine there was no issues whatsoever
the drivers work very well in the driver
program was really good
UG and the gamin
they sometimes don't have the ability to change that you can program your buttons
they don't seem to be able to do that the ones I've seen anyway
its boasts a few other features
this wheel is quite nice
you've got middle and you can move around the middle and program different things for that
let's say zooming in and out and this one can be a brush size and it's very nice
it's very fluid
it does feel pretty good
it was it was a remarkable piece of kit
no problems there worked really well like
I said the drivers seemed really good
the only problem
I did have with my drivers
this one's a bit tricky
there was no sort of weird occasionally with the the much cheaper tablets around 30 pounds
nice experience
now compare this to display tablets
obviously it's a completely different market
hopefully a card in the corner fire
I always seem to forget that but check that out and see what you think
obviously there's there's issues with that being 160 pounds
Pro which is lovely but in terms of the Wacom tablets
I haven't used a modern one so I can't properly compare but I don't
I haven't heard that they've done anything new in special words
this surface does seem to be that much nicer it was very very fluid
it is very similar to a
Wacom pen the nib isn't squishy
it's hard and firm and it just it glides it's nice it is like a
it's got tilt support as well so it this
this has everything that you'd want from your graphics
tablet rather than display tablet
I see anything hasn't got obviously it
it comes in a beautiful box and it's got this huge case for the pen
it's got all your nibs in there
it's got your adaptors for your mobile phone in fact
I won't show them
it's just all fairly obvious
and it's not those sort of things you want to worry about
it's the actual feel and is it comfortable
you can actually use it like this
this like this for your left hand is and so forth
so it's it's quite compatible
they seem to have thought of everything
I can't test is longevity because I will
that would help other people and that'd be perfect
thank you very much
I think that's probably enough for me
so yes this is the best graphics tablet
hello you lovely lot and welcome to a new video today
I'm gonna be doing a review of the Kenton
Katy sixteen screen tablet
this is just gonna be my full and honest opinion of the product
this is actually the first non
Wacom screen tablet that
Katy 16 is a screen tablet with an active screen area measuring 15.6 inches
it's got left and right handed support
Full HD resolution and a color gamut of 92% ntsc
it has an anti glare screen and you can adjust the stand between 15 and 85 degrees
currently this tablet retails on amazon UK at 235 pounds
it's for a screen
the tablet came very well packaged
it came in a sturdy cardboard box which
this tablet came with you
get a little fabric sleeve that you can use to store the pen you get the pen itself
and then they also came with the tool itself to replace them as well and there was an HDMI cable
so here's a quick look the
you do get different kinds of nibs with these
they're quite firm
I tested out replacing one
I didn't actually film it but it was simple enough to replace also in the box you get
I did try the graph that came with the tablet but because I have Hobbit hands
I'm wearing compression gloves because my hands have circulation issues
and they're stupid so don't mind that that's not anything to do with the tablet
I'm just really cold
there isn't any assembly required with this tablet because the stand came already attached
this part is always a fun
so this is where my main issue with this tablet came in on right-handed use
everyone would be a lot more appreciative
the tablet was easy enough to set up though
I did initially try this out on my mum's laptop because I found too late
that mine is too old and doesn't have an HDMI port but it was so slow
and it messed up my recordings so
I'm using this tablet with a seven-year-old Dell Latitude East 6-4 100 with Windows 7 64 bit
the drivers were really easy to download
I'm not sure why it just needed a couple of restarts to kind of get it going
I've used so you kind of have to have a light hand with this tablet
there's no need to replace any batteries
so yeah that was definitely a plus for this tablet
the screen came with a screen protector
already attached to it and there isn't any mention of it in the instruction manual so
I presumed that you weren't supposed to take it off
the colors looked very similar
the surface of this tablet or rather the screen protector felt very nice to use
it wasn't too smooth like the glossy surface of an iPad which is something that I struggle with
and it had a subtle grip and the pen didn't slide around so generally
it felt a lot like working on paper
this tablet said that they were impressed with the lack of parallax
it's basically the distance of the cursor from the pen tip itself so
I calibrated the tablet
in the middle of the shortcut-keys it was easily accessible
and it was very comfortable to use and it turned with a nice solid
you know unless you want to the slotting
the side of the tablet is also handy for storing the pen
I had is that a few times
I used my simplest cell shading style which utilizes fairly sharp
lines to experiment with how smoothly I could make them and I was pleased with the result
I was pleasantly surprised with the Katy sixteen
I personally prefer more variety in the type of nib available since I usually go for felt nibs
if you're looking for your first screen tablet I would say this would make a solid choice
you get a lot of tablet for the price and know it has its moments
performance was generally consistent and it felt great to use
and then there's Rafe in the colored illustration who is from my fantasy novel breakwater
so they're both very good boys but one is significantly smarter than the other
I really hope this video is useful to you and that you enjoyed watching it
please let me know in the comments if there's anything you'd like to know and thank you to
Kenting for sending me this tablet
hi everyone and welcome back in today's video
I'm going to be doing a review and demonstration of the XP pen artist 15.6 IPS graphics
drawing tablet this is a drawing monitor
the tablet comes very well packaged
everything is well wrapped up and protected
the logo is on the underside of the glove
so that's good and the drawing glove is really useful
then we have the pen and the pen
stand the pen is really nice
here's a quick size comparison with a white gel pen that I have
the pen also requires no charging and no batteries
unlike other stylus pens that you need to plug in to charge
this doesn't require any charging and it has 8,192 levels of pressure sensitivity and two
the cables are as compact as possible
these sorts of tablet screens do require a fair amount of different cables
which is recommended you do as it can often fix any bugs or performance issues so
I'm using a default Photoshop
brush here everything today for this
video is default so default settings default brushes
I'm not using anything
fancy as you can see the pressure sensitivity was really great
I started on my demonstration piece
I began with a sketch layer then
I really enjoyed working with the tablet
I thought the performance was really good
I only had one issue which I fixed quite easily and I'll talk about that in a moment
I found the 15.6 inch screen size to be perfect for me
XP pen makes a variety of different screen sizes and price points
this one sits in the middle
I have here is a really nice size for me
it's not too small but I feel cramped when I'm working and it also fits really nicely on my desk
it is something to keep in mind
also this particular model doesn't come of a stand
many of these types of drawing screens come with stands that attach to the back of the tablet
it's an extra but they do have one if the necessary for you
I didn't find it a problem to work flat when I'm drawing normally
it's also quite easy to have a little mobility now that said
I still needed
it plugged into the laptop and into the power source
so it's by no means as portable as a regular iPad or that kind of tablet
this is a drawing monitor
it's a second screen for your PC or laptop but it is quite light and it could be portable
I also really liked the pen design
it's smaller than the other digital pens
I've tried before it's this similar size to a regular pen like I showed earlier
this is great for me because I have quite small hands and my hands
my hand can get strained and tired from holding the larger sized pens and
I also really liked the no charging required function of this pen
and that's a big plus in my book because I never remember to charge my digital pens
I didn't see anything that was noticeable to me
the pen moved
I found in the past that when working in Photoshop
I had with a tablet when I was working
I did have one when I set out the tablet
the pen didn't work correctly
it had a really long lag and it was glitching all over the place when
so if you're having any issues then getting the latest driver may solve them
it did for me
resetting the settings to default tends to fix anything
that's acting odd at least in my experience
that's what's helped me overall
I really like the tablet
it's a nice size it's light
the screen resolution is really good
the pen is great to use the pressure
sensitivity is lovely
I didn't have any problems
working with the tablet
I know these screens are not cheap
this one is more affordable than others
but they still are an investment
that's my final
Hill artwork and my thoughts on this tablet
I hope you enjoyed the review and found it
helpful thanks again to XP pen for letting me try the tablet out
let me know if you have any questions in the comments down below and I will see you next time
hi everyone welcome back to our channel
and today we'll be
i'm doing a review for this kids edition
android tablet the s7 the matrix pad and it's from um thank you
i'm not sure i'm pronouncing that right
and it's for ages three and up
it looks like they have a pre-installed kid ass apps on it
so this tablet is a seven inch ips screen technology
it has front and weird cameras
is the back camera
this is the speaker
so this is the volume the power button and the reset button and up here
you have the um the usb port the memory slot the headphone jack
and here's the front camera
and here's the stylus
oh it's not the case it's the core
it's a usb core charger and just go back into the tablet to charge
and you just tie the end
it comes in pink color green and blue so whichever color your kids like and in the back
there's a stand in the back
all you have to do is just pull it out like that and you can just set it like on a table so here
we have the camera youtube setting chrome file photos
google play that's the pre-installed apps we're going to show you later
here's um voice call and here you have photos drive movie maps and gmail
google don't hit the bomb
the hot dog paint box sounds fun
that's his nose rainbow
let's see what this turns out
i've been eating my
i'm gonna do super slam
what's up here sandy
so i just can't do it away
hello patrick jumped on top of him
hey guys whoo
everything arrived nicely packaged and the first thing I found was this drawing glow
I open the main box I found this little
thank you card
and the tablet itself safe and sound and this clear packaging below that
I'm gonna be testing this tablet on my Mac laptop with Photoshop CC
the tablet is right around $120 and the design is really nice
it's made of quality materials and has these smooth rounded edges
and right out of the box
the pin pressure felt perfect for me and my light-handed touch
the tablet is 11 inches by 6 point 8 7 inches and
I really loved the large drawing area
I never felt cramped which is important
there are eight customizable shortcut keys and I was able to easily program
this tablet can also go wireless which
I'm loved at first
the tablet plugged in directly
I think this is a really awesome tablet
I think it's a solid option for beginners intermediate artists or even advanced artists
picker speeds up my workflow however with the current driver
I'll have those links down below in the description
hey guys and today
I want to talk about the XP pengie 430 gaming tablet
thank you for 50 subscribers
that is $23 right now in
you don't have to charge it or replace batteries
it also comes with ten spare pen tips
a pen tip remover and a quick guide here are some specs
they market this tablet
as a gameplay tablet
the active area is 120 by 77 millimeters
the product weight is 130 grams
there are two color selections black and white
the resolution is 5000 80 lines per inch the report rate is 228 revolutions per second
it works on Mac and Windows and it's usable with both right and left hand
click on the driver tab
download the XP pengie for 30 drivers
the driver has many options such as change the active area
I choose a monitor
you want to use the tablet on and disabled buttons on the pen
though there was one problem which was you cannot disable the pen tip
it's always set to left
the back of the tablet has four rubber stops which prevents it from slipping
and now you might be wondering what's that black spot okay so this is what
I think happens when I play osoo
it's even lighter than the into the thickness of the pen is also very comfortable
it is just around the thickness of the mechanical pencil
I have right there but then there is one problem on the pen that I just really really hated
that was that if you accidentally click on one of the buttons while you're playing
Oh sue
the tablet will randomly freeze
that is a big problem when playing
OSes so at one point I had to pry out the button so they will work after I pry it out the button
the cursor never froze so thankfully that problem was solved
oh yeah
yeah you don't have to worry about that now
let's talk about the cable
the cable is not a micro
USB connection so if you by any way damage the cable oh well
if it doesn't work anymore you have to get a new tablet and now
I will do a live
play using this tablet you yeah
I guess that's okay
hundred is a weird day and there you have it the review for the XP pengie 430 gaming tablet
there's a lot of tablets like this out there like a three on 420 and new
Gulman a 56k or something like that but I really recommend this tablet
if you're thinking of getting a budget tablet anyway guys
thanks for watching
be sure
leave a like and subscribe
be a rebel like me and buy the salad instead of the curry on 4/20
hello everyone a long time
no see haven't seen you since last year anyway today
I'm going to be reviewing a tablet that I got from cam on the graphics
IP pen display
it is huge when I first opened the box
there's the little card from gam on quit
Start Guide it's a Quick Start Guide ok when I first opened it
has this mechanism that you can put it at any like degree that you want that
you're comfortable with drawing with which
that is a case for the screen
the stand and everything can't fit in it
it's just like to protect the drawing tablet
whenever you go in this box there are chords
everybody loves those
these chords are important
don't lose them
this is the power adapter
don't lose that and let more chords
oh wait that's the pen charger
this is a pen charger
hurry up this is the pen stand and nin remover
it has instructions on the bottom
it comes with four screws
don't lose them please
and it comes with the screwdriver to screw on the stand onto your tablet
I don't need to look at the screw
it's a Phillips screwdriver
quit it and in this tiny box if I could get it open
I'm recording with one hand
this is kind of hard open it
gosh finally the pen finally underneath all of that is the actual tablet itself
wow it has ten shortcut keys and five menu keys anyway
it is huge it has 1080 resolution in the area is 13.5 by seven point six inches
there's this matte screen projector on it and you can take it off
it has all the instructions on how to like screw stand on the back
you just line up the holes on the stand with the holes on the tablet and screw it in
it's pretty easy
I'm not handy with tools so it was easy for me and for the bottom two
I found it easier to put the stand down to put them in and for the front ones to put them up
you're so handy with tools aren't you anyway
these are all the cores that you need and the two on the right
go into the tablet and the three on the left
I'll show you in a second see
I plugged those these two in on to my tablet these two in to my computer
Yap format it
that's probably what
I call a power adapter
and then lastly this is the pen charger
it just goes into it
USB port whatever here I just show you how to take the nibs out
it's pretty easy and it fell through great
don't lose that please
there are eight replacement nibs if yours ever get worn down
I didn't show it when I unboxed it
I first started drawing on this
I was like
so you just choose whatever one applies to you
that's all done
you just click on the dots and if your pen is like off or whatever it'll fix it and after that
oh my gosh
it's working again
the pen has over 8,000 levels of pen pressure which is very nice
paint this speed paint is like the first time
I've ever drawn on this and I use this all the time
now when you first get a tablet it's kind of hard just like a normal tablet
not a pen display tablet
when you do that
you have to develop like hand-eye coordination which
it's pretty easy
oh if you're left-handed on the menu you can just flip everything 180 degrees
you can do that on your tablet
I don't know whatever you want
I haven't talked to you guys in a while
I haven't had a lot of time to work on it so I'm still working on it
it'll be out hopefully this month or early next month
I doubt it
I only have a couple of things on there and you can check it out if you want
I don't really care I made it for you guys
I'm still putting some new stuff on there but for now
I'm gonna plug it into my next video
but so thank you very much for being very patient with me
I am stressed but I hope you like this video
you don't have to like it but if you like it like it well you'll stop anyway
I hope to see from you guys later because I know you want to see from me later
I'm sorry and thank you so much for watching
it's more comfortable smart device for those who need a wide screen for studies and entertainment
the alcatel one t10 appears to be an excellent option
this tablet was unveiled in last year
october i have been testing it for past few days
and here is my review
so this smart tablet by alcatel has a simple and ergonomic design
it's not too thin for you to treat it properly for viewing but i have to admit that it's 450 grams
heavy it's made of sturdy and high quality polycarbonate so it's going to last for a long time
the black panel had a slightly textured surface
that could hide fingerprints reasonably well
mm audio jack usb type c port and the sd card slot yes
this is a wi-fi only device and through the slot
we can expand the memory up to 128 gigs moving
to the right
we find the power button volume rockers and mic turning to the left we find the speaker
grilles this is a 10 inch ips
screen hd tab with 1280 by 800 resolution at 151 ppi
i realize it's not the brightest screen in the bunch
fhd resolution
another thing i didn't like about this
one is the brightness of the screen
the degree of the detail is appropriate
this tablet is powered by mediatex
octa-core mt-8167 chipset with two gigs of ram and 32 gigs of internal storage
i ran some benchmark test on this tablet and here are the scores as i said before the alcatel 1t10
it can't manage multitasking
you should also realize that
this tablet is not built for heavy games
this may be enough
as far as consistency is concerned
this hybrid tablet is powered by 4080mah battery
which you might feel is too little
it has two speaker grilles which provide a loud and strong sound
this is particularly good
hissing sounds they worked
the other person was not feeling any difference in calls as well
thanks to alcatel for providing a keyboard along with this
smart tablet is your choice
it is very understandable
i say having a laptop and a tablet at this price is rare
the current price will be updated in the description
so just check that out with that
we have come to the end of this video
i will meet you in the next one until then this is manish signing off you
this is the Samsung Galaxy
Tab s 10.5
let's puts this beautiful
Super AMOLED screen and in this video
we'll be doing a full in-depth review
hi this is
Ranjit and I have been using the Samsung Galaxy
Tab s for about 20 days now and the striking thing about this tablet is its display
it supports a very high resolution screen and sports a Super AMOLED screen
for example we have this hand con office suit which is a replacement for Microsoft
Office at it now
it works pretty well the UI is the Samsung magazine
screen sportings a resolution of 2,560
hundred pixels the tablet has three gigs of ram hence
I did not even have four problems loading very heavy websites on this tab
s moving to the other browser for example
I noticed art on the Chrome web browser specifically the experience was not that smooth
the staff s 10.5 is powered by
Exynos octa-core processor
it has a 8 core processor 3 gigs of RAM and 16 GB of internal storage
how vibrant they look on this tab
s due to that
Super AMOLED display
the blacks are inky blacks and the contrast level is also excellent
on this tablet
we also have the fingerprint scanner which is embedded within the home button
so if you have a Samsung based Android smartphone with the Wi-Fi direct
this is an ideal solution
it just weighs 467 grams
so even folding in a single hand is a decent experience
so what do I think about this Samsung Galaxy
I noticed some cons with the stylus
I don't feel that they're very loud
the speaker should have been front firing
because even at max volume
I felt that the volume was not that great also in the UI it uses the Samsung magazine
that's a little bit of a corn and coming to the last night is in India
Samsung is just selling this 3G and Wi-Fi variant they are not selling the Wi-Fi only variant
have a look at this
Samsung Galaxy Tab s 10.5

hello everyone this is - today
I have a drawing tablet review for you
this is the week 15
Pro the price for this at the time of this review is us 15 $9.99 on amazon.com
so we have an artist glue that's included and this is the tablet
it's a 10 by 6 inch drawing tablet
let me just this side
we have this cart
that tells you where you can download the driver the USB cable
this is the stand for the pen
you have the pen and the pen case
and what's this underneath the box
oh okay so
I'm just taking everything out first
the whole pen is made of plastic so it feels a bit hollow but it's well built
it's very solid
just that it feels a bit hollow two side buttons here and a grip section
it's matte it's nice a hole that's the nib and the design is very simple at the back here
we have this home but this hand is not how about battery so you don't have to charge it
let's take a look at the tablet itself now in an earlier video
we have this wheel and in the middle
there is a button design of the tablet
it's very simple and clean
we have 12 physical shortcut buttons on the left and it's very thin on back
we have four small rubber feet
and there's a grid dot texture which you may not see the dry surface it's matte
it's nice to touch and build quality
it's actually quite solid
I like the design
I like the rounded corners
it looks very slick alright
let's connect this to my computer and test it out
I'm using Windows now and I've just installed a Windows driver
so let's see what we can do with the driver
so this is where it can customize the pen to side buttons and pressure sensitivity
I like that you can control the pressure curve manually like this instead of using the slider
this is mapping
I'm going to leave this as default and if you're left-handed you can choose this option here
the left hand mode
Windows ink on or off
this is where you can customize the twelve physical shortcut buttons
I have already set the usual shortcuts that are used
let's see what you can assign to each physical shortcut button
so he can assign mouse clicks
this is the pen eraser toggle
this is the dahle function switch
Windows ink let me turn on Windows ink and try it again alright
I may reduce the brush
I see some jitter pressure jitter all right now
it's better now
it's much smoother
let me try and draw slow lines
I'm not going to draw anything complicated for this review
I just want you guys to see the line quality so the line quality is quite good
let me try the scroll wheel
sixty dollars and a 15 non-pro it's us 56 dollars
I don't have any major issues except for the usual Photoshop
lag the lines
they seem to come out just the way
they also respond to pressure
I've just corrected
the shock cut so now redo it's working fine this buttons
they have very nice firm feedback this is MIDI bang paint Pro okay
this is way more responsive compared to Photoshop and pressure sensitivity works really
well let's try to slow lines again
I don't see any jitter
which is great has tried a transition from thin to thick
it's not as smooth
so let me just zoom down a bit and try again all right now
it's smoother this is
Krita now notice the shape of the cursor
it's a horizontal rectangle
I'm using a toothbrush
quita is also of very responsive app by the way this drawing tablet
um it's one of those where there is no screen on the tablet
so you have to actually look at your display and draw nowadays when
I reviewed have this
this is clip studio
paint pressure
works really well
this is also very responsive
let me just draw my daughter who is now almost two years
oh so this is her playing with her toys in the morning clip studio paint
it's very responsive and pressure
I expect them to so
that's fantastic
this review will not be complete without me showing you how it performs on
Mac OS so this is clip studio paint now
I discovered a few issues with Mac OS driver
so the first issue is the function switch
I've actually assigned here so I click
I just clicked that and now I can see the zoom it works and now I click it again
it changed to changing the brush
size windows driver works fine just that with Mac OS driver
it doesn't work so by default
alright to conclude if you are a Windows user
this is a drunk tablet
I can recommend very easily for us
$60 it looks good
it has a lot of shortcut buttons
it's well-built
the pen is sensitive and accurate and drawing performance with the various drawing software that
I've tested on Windows
they work really well so no issues with
Windows if you are a Mac OS user with the current driver version 2.0 point 0.6
i wouldn't recommend this tablet to make OS uses for the issues
you can find them through the links in the video description below
alright so thanks for watching
if you have any questions let me know in the comment section
if not see you guys in the next video bye
The Huion HS64 is a mini drawing tablet
that works with computers
like you would expect, but you can also use on
Android phones and tablets.
Android devices only.
This doesn’t work on iPhones or iPads.
What’s in the box?
Wireless pen with 2 shortcut buttons.
Two packs of extra pen tips and a tip remover. Five foot long tablet cable.
Adaptors for the cable.
It won’t work below that.
Your device’s settings, system settings, or about page shows your version.
Next, plug the cord into the tablet.
Pick the adaptor end that fits your device, plug that to the other end of the cable.
Then plug the cable into your device.
In this case the tablet works without having to do anything else.
Just plug it in and play.
On some devices, you will need to go to settings and enable OTG for the tablet to work.
Those only work on computers.
Also, you can’t rotate your phone or tablet to draw in landscape mode.
Pressure sensitivity does work. The HS64 also works with computers.
For computer use
you need to install a driver.
First, uninstall any other tablet drivers. If you uninstall something, restart your computer.
Go to huion.com/download.
Type in HS64.
Download the driver for Windows or Mac, depending on what you use.
Right click, extract.
Double click the installer.
Install. Plug your tablet in.
Your tablet settings show up in two places: on the desktop and in the icon tray.
Ok, now you can change settings.
Set your shortcut buttons at the top.
In the second tab, set the pen’s shortcut buttons.
Use the righthand slider to change
how sensitive the pen pressure is.
Game Mode is good for playing games like OSU.
In the third tab you can customize what area the tablet uses to represent your screen.
And the last tab
You may also reset to default here.
What do I think of this tablet?
Well, I’m amazed something so small works so well.
Unlike drawing tablets that have screens, with a screenless tablet
you can have a size this tiny and still feel comfortable.
And for $35, that’s a steal.
It’s so cheap!
I don’t have a stylus for my phone, so I couldn’t compare that.
You really do need a phone
stand for this, though.
I’m very lucky
my phone didn’t fall off the slippery book tower.
As for phone battery drain, it’ll vary depending on your phone and drawing app.
For me, using the tablet in Flipaclip cost 8% of battery charge per hour.
On the computer side, I have no criticisms.
Everything about drawing felt smooth and natural.
The small drawing area meant I didn’t have as much control as I would with a bigger tablet.
That’s it, really.
For somebody who wants to try out digital art without spending $70, the HS64 is a good choice.
Hope this helps!
now the only other tablet that may be announced soon is the tab
S but if anything
that's a speculation of this video
but if you need a tablet and don't want to wait for the best of the best
Samsung just released their newest mid tier model the Tab
A now I personally paid two hundred and twenty nine dollars at the time this video
for the eight inch model a nine point seven inch version comes in at 299
I'm Jimmy wood Jim's review room comm and I'm here to help you make a purchase decision
welcome everyone to another review going over
S on paper
it's a very minor difference being a little over
inches wide making this just big enough to be enjoyable but not too big where
I couldn't hold it with one hand now
the entire unit is made of plastic but being so thin and built with a smooth texture
on the back there's no faux leather
it doesn't feel like that seamless piece of glass
that would go all the way to the edge
but that's really being nitpicky on the aesthetics but now going around its physical features
starting with the right offers very clicky and good feedback
power and volume buttons graciously a micro
SD card slot makes a return here offering up to 128 gigs of expandable storage
now going on to the very bottom is a micro
USB charging port with a 3 and 1/2 millimeter headphone input
next by now to the left of that is one speaker that serves its purpose here for music
it's a bit underwhelming
units probably equivalent to my samsung note
4 smart phone
it's not too loud but with movies
it's not bad at all in hearing actor voices and sound effects
it's not strong in the bass
it is to be expected though on nearly every tablet then last year
there's nothing on the left side and nothing on the top
our photos right from the tablet itself
that's unedited and you can be the judge if this looks good to you or not
in addition last year's tab for tablets had a higher resolution and a 16 by 10 wide aspect ratio
now just like most if not all
let's say or those who have a decent tan on screen will look a bit reddish or yellow
Android 5.0 on a Qualcomm apq 8016 running at 1.2 gigahertz on a quad-core processor
now only one and a half gigs of RAM is on board again and 16 gigabytes of internal memory
now keep in mind you can still have the you still have the microSD card slot to use
Lite to general web surfing it runs fine from my experience and most games of the App
despite not being the best the best this can handle the generic wants it to load it up
you can run it perfectly
fine i got'em it because of its low
ram count a 1.5 on android
just really doesn't cut it from moderate users
if you have a few tabs in a web-browser
I did notice more
that's more of a ramp issue
I believe but now let's take a look at the interface here
real quick smooth transitions swiping all the way to the left now features
Flipboard where you can see all of your news
sources and magazines that you accumulate
Samsung has dropped a magazine
email the weather
let's say and it's
I'll be honest
unfortunately it has similar specs as the tab for from last year but goes down on the resolution
the 1.5 gigs is very much 2013 maybe 2014 here spec requirements there and
I'm shocked as far as we're into technology today
we're not at the standard of at least two gigs or three gigs of RAM
it's a to be answered
you starting to show and being fair it works
it's good for a light to generic use here
it's very portable
the battery seems decent
2 gigs of RAM 77 percent increase in pixel density for sharper images and
I'll repeat it again
it's the same price basically as the Tab
A when it is not on sale if it's on sale you're shelling out an additional $30 or so so
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room
comm you guys take care and I'll see you in the next one bye
so i enjoy the occasional game of elite dangerous and by occasional
so i'd seen something recently
that would help me out with this but i would need a tablet handily dragon
touch have been in touch and asked me to review one of their tablets
this is it
this is the 10 inch dragon touch android tablet
i'm not the only one with this keyboard shortcut problem if you look online
i didn't always want to talk to the computer and i also often just forgot the commands
i hadn't yet tried
this is game
glass this is a free to download app for your phone and tablet you
you don't have to look something up and then look at your keyboard
you simply put and prod your tablet or mobile phone
it sounded fantastic
touch tablet works really well together
game glass maps the controls
i always forget about onto the tablet screen and allows you to push and swipe your way around
the dragon touch tablet and game
glass work brilliantly
well together i'm really enjoying the combination
it's quite a chunky tablet
but round the side you've got the volume rockers
and the power button
it's very good for multimedia
let's fire up netflix
and check out the interface as quite often
these low-cost tablets can suffer from slightly sluggish interface
but you can see here
netflix works fine
it's actually quite smooth as you're scrolling through and the playback is also fine
well if we take a look at asphalt 8 you can see it runs really well
it's really nice and smooth
it's responsive this game uses motion controls
so you tilt it left and right to control the car and it was really good fun
i got lost in this for quite a while racing around the track one thing i will say though
the sound quality isn't brilliant
the speakers are on the top
i fired up
google docs and found this worked very well
on the tablet you can easily search for images type via the on-screen keyboard
it handles all basic tasks
really well i highly recommend game class
the tablet's very good as well even if you're not using it for game glass
it has a range of usage
you may have noticed
the tablet was on a really cool stand
we're going to be checking out the five best budget tablets right now
be sure to check the links in the description below okay
so let's get started with the video
the fifth product on our list is the amazon fire hd8
then the amazon fire hd 8 is a great budget option for you
the colors are surprisingly good but lack
the deeper blacks found on more expensive tabs overall
the performance is quite impressive for a sub 100 tablet
it does feature their amazon kids mode for child safe content
the key features are display the 8 inch
you'll get about 12 hours of mix use dual 2 megapixel cameras
you'll find it's fine for video chats as long as you have decent lighting built-in alexa
you can ask alexa to find information play videos or music or even open apps
dual speakers delivers decent
sound for watching movies and listening to music
the fourth product on our list is the lenovo tab m10 plus
this is our best budget tablet for families
bezels giving you a higher screen to display ratio overall
atmos is ideal for families to watch videos movies
tv shows and play games together making it an ideal entertainment device for home or on the go
you also get a kids mode which gives you a little more
parental controls than what the fire hd offers
so you can be assured they only have access to child safe content plus the built-in eye care
protection helps to reduce the risk of eye strain
which is something you don't normally find at this price range battery
you'll get about seven hours of video playback which may be the only weak point of this tablet
the third product on our list is the samsung galaxy
tab a this is our best value budget tablet
but it's still easy to hold with even one hand while watching videos or reading
samsung will be a better option for you if you need more expandable storage than that
stay tuned for the samsung galaxy
tab s6 lite coming up later in the video with expandable storage up to one terabyte
you'll get about 13 hours of mix use 5 megapixel front facing and 8 megapixel rear cameras
you'll find it's great
for video chats
atmos surround
this is our best budget ipad
if you're looking for an affordable ipad the latest 8th gen ipad features an upgraded processor
that now gives you the biggest bang for the buck when it comes to apple's ipad lineup
making it a great budget option for you especially if this is your first ipad
but what's also great about the ipad is that it's not only for entertainment
you can even connect a mouse or trackpad making your work
efficient and seamless
you can take notes
edit photos
draw sketch or paint making it
great for creatives
except there isn't anywhere to properly store your pencil when you're not using it
you'll love the incredible detail and vivid colors all day battery
you can expect up to 10 hours of mixed use a12 bionic chip
it sounds impressive
there's really nothing it can't do if you're on a tighter budget
the ipad delivers exceptional value and unmatched performance in an entry-level tablet
this is our best overall budget tablet
lite may be a great option for you
really gives it a premium look and feel without the premium price
atmos support
aren't bad giving you a more cinematic audio experience
details and colors
expandable storage doubles the galaxy tab
a 10.1 with up to one terabyte of storage s pen included
lets you easily write notes
lite brings a lot to the table
thanks for watching
and that's all for this video
hope to see you guys in the next video till next time
i'll see you later
hello everyone in this video
I'm going to be unboxing
and reviewing the human dwh 6:9 tablet
he went
extend me this tablet for a review but all thoughts and opinions will be my own
so let's get unboxing so here in the Box
we have
ooh this cool
it's like a carrying case dancing
it's a very nice soft bag to hold the tablet in
the active area on this tablet is 9 by 6 inches
it is very nice and it's very thin and light
it is not heavy at all next in the Box
we have this glove
this makes it easier for your hand to uh glide across the tablet
I've never actually had one of these
I've always wanted one of these though
that's very cool
it's very nice so over here
the pen does need to be charged
so as you review what you get in
the box is the tablet
you get the soft carrying bag to carry the tablet in which is really handy
I was super happy about
I usually have a lot of problems when installing tablets on my computer
it has 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity and
I think this one has 8 Express keys which is really cool
I did try
the tablet on the wireless setting for a little while for most of this picture
I had it on the wired
setting um so for the wireless
I was really happy
with how easy the wireless was to set up
I was expecting it to be really complicated overall
I thought the wireless worked very well
I did find interesting
is that the
Helion pen is a rechargeable pen and it needs to be charged for most other tablets
the pen does not require any battery or charging so
I did find this to be interesting so at first
it has a six hundred hour battery life so
I don't think you'll have to worry about it
so the price of the huion tablet is $100
this is a very reasonable price
the tablets are usually about 200 dollars
so this tablet is about half the price of other competing tablets overall
I really enjoyed working of the Hylian tablet and I think it worked very well
I would highly recommend it for beginning artists that are wanting to get into digital art
I would overall give the Helion tablet a 5 out of 5 stars
I think it worked very well and I really enjoyed my experience with it
so this ends my review of huion dw8 69
thank you all so much for watching and I'll see you in my next video
hi guys this is yi from dove
Kabir solutions with a review of the HP Proust slate 12 Android tablet
you've got a 1600 by 1200 resolution which is ok
it's not full
HD of course
you've got docking station
connector at the bottom this particular model has nano
SIM this would have had microSD here as well headphone the charging micro USB at the top
you've got the power and on off at the front
you've got a 2 megapixel camera at the back
we've got a trial version of coal painter
the full app costs three pound 89 from the
Play Store
it's not bad
I think it's actually quite good value if you want to use this tablet for as
I say drawing artistic drawing and creative faults if on the other hand you want to take notes
HP have included this HP notes app
which gives you two options so from here
which is where you can write on a paper notepad and it copies whatever
what you're actually writing on the piece of paper which
I'll show you a demonstration in a second so in regards to just using it as a standard
let's just change that for a little bit
so just there's a standard kind of as you can see very good handwriting
this is the view of HP Pro 12
so it's on the pen mode and then from there
we align the tablet and it's a bit tricky
at first
you have to make sure you line
let's just see if this works as you can see as we're writing on the paper version it copies what
I'm writing from the paper to the screen
maybe if it's a general use tablet that you after it's okay
then it's pretty good so thanks for watching
I hope you enjoyed it
please like our video

hope to see you soon
Thanks
it's as sleek as a tablet can get these days
oh and it's waterproof the Xperia z4 tablet is gorgeous
to look at
it's got a clean and flat look and it takes portability seriously
around the screen are now slimmer
but you still have front-facing stereo speakers flanking and on either side
unfortunately those aren't as loud as the iPad Air's the microUSB port and the audio
jack don't have any flaps protecting them but they are safely waterproof now
that's one thing that we were more than happy to test for the camera
there you go
Sony's Xperia UI has graduated to Android lollipop and the UI
aesthetic is quite close to what you have on stock
Android it still feels unmistakably sunny
thanks to the proprietary widgets
the neverending live wallpaper and the side context menus you also get
I like Samsung's tablets though
there is no split screen mode for running two apps side-by-side
Snapdragon chipset on tap the Xperia
z4 tablet is very fast our benchmarks show great
LTE version standby is impressive to the eight point
one megapixel camera produces great images photos
come out nice and sharp with spot-on colors
full-size light it's impossibly thin and light and it's also a pleasure to use
well this one hardly has a match out there
hey everybody a flaw inside but in the folks in
Lenovo let us borrow their tab to a ten tablet to check out today
is its screen
it's got a really nice
the performance is a little bit lacking
but that's mainly because they put so much into the display
you have to take some things out in other places so it has an MT 8165 processor
you like fruit ninja or something like that will be fine
but when you get into some of the higher-end 3d stuff that will struggle on here but again
this is a non gaming tablet
you can buy this
here the standby button is there and that's pretty much it for ports
there wasn't much else on here
you do have a headset
adapter here at the top on the back
you've got an 8 megapixel camera so you can take some pictures you know
I took out in my garden
it's a really nice browsing experience overall
I am running the Chrome browser right
they're very decent as far as its frame rates concerns
and while this is not a high-end gaming tablet it's certainly capable of running games
it's certainly playable may not be as smooth as it is on something that costs more or something
it's really going to lag quite a bit
pretty well on here and I like to run the 3dmark benchmark
so this one has it again
the nice 10 inch display very high resolution
the battery is really good on here
who's just looking to read some stuff do some email
maybe play a game every once in awhile and doesn't want to spend more than 250 dollars
thanks for watching you
oh boy I sure do love this
screen tablet hello
Courtney uh who are you
it's me Hawaiian Oh huion you look so different
now what happened
please take me back
I know I did you wrong
I know I wasn't always there for you that's why I've made some changes to my life
please give me one more chance
Courtney baby come back
you can blame it all on me
what the heck
I'll give you one more chance
so here's a funny story you know
how in the last tablet review
yes who contacted me that's right
Hugh Leon it's like they knew I was betraying them
they also offered a free tablet in order to review it so here we are again and once again
I'll be doing a redesign to test it out like I said in the last one
I can't really redesign S&T however I can redesign super SMT
let's crack open this tablet
let's see what's under the hood ok
I'm already seeing some pros and cons pros
it comes with two drawing gloves just in case you lose one
the pen doesn't need to be charged and it comes with a cleaning cloth for your screen
that'll be handy however
I see one major major con here
he doesn't come with a stand
which is not very good for your posture
just something to consider if you want to buy this tablet all that aside
why don't we start test seeing this out by drawing something
I even drawn a super form for S&T since 2009
so it's about high time
I do a redesign for it for a reference
this is what our super form looked like back then
I even made a fancy pantsy transformation video for it
I'm not sure why but I made it like flowy and angelic
it seems kind of silly now but I'm gonna leave this in the corner
just for a teeny bit of inspiration
I mean it does make a little bit of sense especially with the current canon of S&T
Chaos Emeralds
it'd be madness also right before
I streamed a Twitter
user named in spaghetti sent me a redesign that they did very quickly
I really wanted S&T to have that super look in her hair
kind of like how
Sonic and shadows quills look so I did my best to capture that shape
I not only made her hair bigger but also point Z er
I pointed her ponytail and bangs upward to further
get that effect for her clothes
I basically wanted to do her
regular outfit but upgraded like if she had an evolution like a Pokemon
this would be the next step up
I changed the gloves into these sort of half gloves
I was half inspired by my drawing gloves
I gave her skirt a belt because I felt like
that'd be a nice little upgrade
that's basically it for the sketch
now let's move on to the coloring so my inspiration for the colors was that
I took the S&T reference and color shifted it until her hair
was this golden blonde
like she was in a super form and when
I did that her clothes turned blue and I really liked how that looked
I inverted the shades of blue on our shoes and I really liked how that looked so I kept it
I even added a darker darker shade of blue into the mix to make it more dynamic
the color shifted
I actually did a lot more to this
so here's the final product
I really love how this design turned out
it made me feel really good now for my final thoughts on the Huey on canvas
this is actually a really nice tablet
it has a smooth surface
that feels very nice to draw on and the colors look really good on it and once
I got the hit detection lined up
it felt a lot more accurate than the
I'll definitely be buying a stand for it though what should I do with this extra tablet though
I don't want to let it go to waste my Christmas
hey everyone sage here back again with another video and yes another tablet review
i'm proud to say that this video is brought to you by galman again
this tablet is pretty small and perfect for beginners
so if you are a beginner and you want a drawing tablet keep on watching okay
so let's open it up the first thing you will see after opening the box
the warranty card can be found right behind the thank you card
then you can see the tablet itself and a little compartment right beside it on the left side
you have to open up the compartment first before getting the actual tablet inside it
you can see the pen it's battery free and you don't have to charge it which is very convenient
and if you will actually connect it to your android device there are these adapters you can use
so sorry about that
and the next one is the tablet itself
this is a really good start
so that whenever you're working the tablet won't slip off
after the tablet you can also see a bunch of things the nibs and the nib remover
the artist club
i'm actually shocked that there is an artist's glove for this and the manual
i first tested this out with my android phone and it works perfectly fine though
i'm not really used to drawing with my phone
of course i needed a driver so i went to their website searched up the driver
according to the tablet model downloaded it and installed it in my computer
then i went on to setting things up before i actually say my thoughts about this tablet
enjoy the speed paint first
i was here and now you're telling me that it was not enough
i told you that's a monster ago
but guess you couldn't count
i'm here for you you know
even if i'm not around you can wake me up
i will try someday
come around will go through and forcing you to say i'm here for you
you know even if i'm not around you can wake me up
i will drive my kids to make you feel alright
i know what you deserve when no one showed you
love will someday come around with foreign so okay
so my thoughts about this tablet
i am actually amazed at the performance of this product
the express keys worked well too and i had no issues with this at all
you can get this tablet with a 28 off discount again
if you're interested
please read the description for more details
and that's it for this video
thank you so much for watching and i'll see you guys soon
peace out
bye the cable where you're supposed to con
how do i say it cable
where you're supposed to connect your tablet to your computer or your android iphone
i actually said iphone one at first i tested out the pho
why did i say phone instead of a tablet
i'm not okay
the pressure sensitivity was working
well the tablet tablet
i mean the pen is pretty responsive sage
what is your problem
i definitely recommend it rivery you
hi everyone this is teal from pocket box comm today
I'm going to review the who
Yan a spheroid
g10 tee this is actually a wireless tablet for use with your computer
we all sent this to me a few weeks ago
I've been trying this off for a few weeks today
I'm going to talk about it
this review will cover the use of this tablet on Mac OS and also on Windows
this is the packaging box
I have already taken out the tablet rice
do you want to show it to you
so they have this cushion to protect the tablet
that is supposed to be inside
this is a thank you card
these are the boxes that hold accessories inside this box
there are the driver
and this is the box with the pen case and the pen
so let me put this away to show you the actual tablet
so this is the tablet when
I first took it out of the box
I was really impressed by the you
quality disk feels very sturdy
at the back we have one solid piece of metal and the front
the finishing is very nice
it has these max of is finishing
the corners are rounded all the look and feel of
this tablet is just top-notch now the main highlight of this header is the wireless capability
and also this trackpad
this is the power switch to use it
you will need to switch this on if you are charging it
it's already on
this trackpad is quite similar to trackpads that you can find on laptops so it works the as well
there are six physical shortcut buttons depress
the tactile feel of all these buttons are quite good
the feeling of the trackpad is good as well
the size of the trackpad is
I would say quite good
there are some blemishes
they were not there when
I took these out of the box
but for some reason they appeared suddenly and some blemishes here as well
so this tablet you can attract some blemishes and
I'm not sure you can see the fingerprints
they do not work as well as I expect them to be
I'll talk more about that later on now
the working area of this tablet is 10 inches by 6 inches
and there is very little basil around the edges the top and the bottom
let's look at the pen case the pen and other accessories
this is a nice looking case or well-built very sturdy
there are two mannix here that closes the case tightly and this is the pen
it supports 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity
it's rather long and it has a tapered end here
there are two buttons here
it's battery-powered so you do need to charge it
there are eight replacement nibs
and this is the wireless USB receiver to use the tablet in why this mod
it's a very small receiver
make sure you do not lose this
this is the charging cable for the pen
this pen is good
they are always quite good and this habit here is rated for 40 hours and only stop use and
I don't think that's going to be a problem
if it runs all battery just charge it
I'm now using the tablet in Wireless mode
this is where we can change their shortcut buttons
you can map the whole tablet to the whole screen
the tablet is using a 16 by 9 aspect ratio
so this area services for white aspect screens which most monitors are nowadays anyway
and here in this part you can actually rotate the tablet
I'm not going to show you how the tablet performs with various drawing apps
the tablet supports micro
Sol and newer if you are using older Mac OS then
there could be some issues
they are all in the text review that is on my blog
just visit the link in the video description below all right this is
Photoshop cs5 on the Mac
let me create a new file
there is no
Jeter in the line so for drawing in Photoshop I think it works quite well
there are no lines so that happened to me quite a lot but in today's demonstration
so that's great
let me switch over to Adobe Illustrator let me create a new file so with illustrator
it looks as well let me try and pick a brush that has variation in terms of the thickness
let's see if it works so here it seems that it works as well so I can get thin and thick lines
all right
the straighter looks let me switch over to using
Tai yasue sketches Pro
this is a drawing app
meant for tablets but it's also available on the Mac desktop
so let me pick up this brush and it works very nicely with this caching app
pressure works is very smooth
there is no lack lines
there are no what you turn in fact
I think this performs even better compared to Photoshop
the lines they taper quite well and now let me switch over to using mischeif
this chief looks fine
Pro so it works very well with MIDI Bank King
Pro pressure works no lack
the lines are smooth
no jitter at all
all right here is where
that's designed for the tablet so it supports all those features
I have created a new flower in MIDI Bank
so let me try that
I'm rotating right now using the trackpad clockwise and it does not work
it doesn't seem to recognize what I'm trying to do
so this is quite frustrating
it just does not work
let me try rotating anti-clockwise
it doesn't work as well so when I'm using MIDI Bank on the iPad when I do this gesture
it will
rotate very intuitively
but not so with this
we on tablet alright
I'm going to give up and now I'm going to pinch to zoom and zoom out
it seems that our just does not work
let me try
mischief mischief should be able to rotate
so let me draw the letter
A again and try it with mischief
I'm now going to switch over to using Crete R
I'm not familiar with this app so I'm just going to pick a default brush
this is basic tip default size ability
and let's see
I'm not sure if it's supposed to behave like this
the pressure works anyway so it somehow works in
Crete R or not work
I'm not too sure so
these are the apps that
I've tested today on my Mac
let me open my tax review to see if
it will create dots instead of lines but introduce demonstration it work fine with MIDI Bank pin
Pro 10.2 you can produce unwanted splotches randomly often triggered by sudden change of pressure
yes again can you see the changes in pressure even though I applied the same weight over
that wasn't this problem but now there is this problem
let me go back
to the text review so illustrator cs5 works fine is chief sketches procreate
our affinity photo and designer
they all look fine
there are issues on
Windows it does not work with Photoshop when I install the drivers on my windows
I'm going to try to use
photoshop cs5 it crashes whenever I click on the tablet so photoshop cs5 on Windows 10
it doesn't work
nothing comes out now with illustrator cs5 and CC
I think illustrator cs5 it works fine but with illustrator
it will always drag my buttons around when in fact
I just want to click the button to open that pad
so that's an issue as well if you find out that it's a lot to take in
let me summarize for you
the build quality is excellent
the wireless capability is very useful
the trackpad is close to being useless
we've just have them because there are a lot of issues
I have to test to see if I can replicate them
and today you see in some of my demonstration
that's all for today's review
if you have any questions feel free to post them in the comment section below
I hope this review is helpful
and if you want to check out reviews for other tablets the link is in my video description below
thanks for watching see you in the video I you
hi guys welcome back today
i have a really good tablet
currently i've just checked on amazon.com uk
you're getting a tablet with
so i think the tablet for that price and those specs that is just the sweet spot
i don't understand why they've mixed the colors
we have power volume
rocker seems to be a microphone
there and type c port for charging along the bottom here
we have a sim tray and a headphone socket
i actually asked myself when i got this
june was the latest security update so in terms of that
that's pretty good
there's no real bloatware on the on the tablet either and i installed a few games
i played some games on it
my son played some games on it as well battery life
i got around about four hours
i haven't actually tried it as a phone
i don't know how that would actually work
we have speakers here at the bottom and they do go really loud
lay it flat and have it full blast or near a full blast
then it's more manageable on the ear my ears anyway obviously
and you can hear what's coming out the speaker but you may need to just put it down a few notches
the tablet does come with two cameras
five megapixel on the rear and two megapixel on the front
don't buy this tablet for a camera because it's it's not good
here's a photo on the back
this is great
eight cores four gigs of ram plenty of storage as well
it is a very very good tablet and something
i think you should consider
if you're looking for one
it's got a headphone jack
as well there which is great
i just think it is a great tablet for how much you're paying
so if you're looking for a tablet and you've got 100 quid
i would definitely definitely recommend this one
the fact that it's got 4g capabilities as well if you've got a sim card
see you in the next one bye you
Hello everyone, welcome back to the Keep Productive YouTube channel on today's feature
We're finally checking out the remarkable tablet
I wanted to review a combination of things today
the design the hardware the software and
All you need to know but I will be doing a longer review.
But without further ado folks.
Let's dive into today's video
But I will be doing a much more in-depth feature I want to share a few of the small things
That have happened to me as I'm using this device and also how it frames itself as well
So that's a really important thing.
How does this?
frame itself and the way that they promote it on their website is it's this
Really encourage you to get in the mindset of offline And try and work on this e-ink display
So let's first start by talking about the design now first off.
It is very thin as you can see
Is it the top and the bottom
you have this like rubber that helps for example?
And that's a really small detail
But actually helps to improve your writing and also get you a bit more focused now
It's it gets a little bit scuffed and I've been fairly careful with it
keeping it in a portfolio that they offer with it
Maybe that's cuz I got the white edition.
It doesn't happen in the black one
It works very well.
There were three buttons at the bottom in the middle
What's really nice is when you're using it.
It sounds like paper.
I don't know whether you can hear that
Feels like paper
Now something I'd say is the battery
life is pretty reasonable on this device
It touts a five to seven day battery life, but I've would say it's a little bit less an app
But I'll just for example be tire writing or making sketches or something like that
And naturally that's when the Battery depletes faster
It does charge up in one hour.
So that's a pretty reasonable recharge time
Okay, so that was more about the hardware and let's talk a little bit about the software now.
Let's talk about this
This is the pen that comes along with it.
Although this one isn't there's two types of pen. There's like a Classic one.
I don't know the word for it
and it's also this signature one now they both
what both work in the same way one is white one is black but as you can imagine
It does allow you to write pretty well on it.
They have these nib things on top and you can change them
They give you some cartridges for free.
I don't think they get worn down as fast.
I've probably only changed my once in two months
I want to start with the Wi-Fi You can connect to your home Wi-Fi or whatever.
You can do one of two things you can either Connect it.
And it's helpful for annotating but nothing major
It's again something that you'll find that you may use
But you could probably do with something else you already use like scannable or Evernote now
You can create notes now
The good thing is one thing I was impressed with
is they have things called templates?
So for example, you create a note you don't necessarily have to have it blank.
You can have dotted notes
You can have these pre created week planners and a range of other ones as well
So you do get to start out both in portrait and landscape if you want to get started
So once you create a notebook there is a range of options down the left hand side
But something to note on the highlighter side is obviously this is an Ian display
It's only gonna show one color and that is dark so you can do shades so you can do
I believe it's a thin thick and Thick thin medium and thick
and also when you're using the highlighter, you can change the shade you
Have an eraser and you can also move certain elements around you can zoom in zoom out
So it is a very handy canvas
Now there is something called Live View.
You can also do handwritten text and then convert it into text
But I would say you have to be a very good writer
Now the one feature I've liked is the send by email feature
To other people in your team in a range of different formats so That's very handy
Being able to send it in a PNG or PDF, which is very helpful
Now there are some abilities for sketches
There's thing called layers
where you can edit the layers, for example
So I created this sort of new structure
so can actually sort of plan out stuff a bit more strategically
So you do get to access menu where you can see all of your notebooks
PDF ebooks and favorites
you can view stuff in lists or gallery view, but those are the only two options and one thing
I'm showing you so make sure you go to Settings and check that you've got an able update on
So on the settings side of stuff you can do a range of things.
You can set it to flight mode
I wouldn't think I look at but at the same time
Which allow you to get started
pretty instantaneously give you an example of the features, but in the bottom left hand corner
I've been getting already
I'm gonna say I like it
I'm gonna say I like it
7 to 8 out of 10 and the main reason is
I've never really had a Tablet.
So for me, this is like a really nice experience
That one takes me away from the screen and allows me to make like for example
its style use of it because you're using a little less paper across a day
But it doesn't necessarily replace a journaling or anything like that.
I like journaling on paper
I don't know why I think it's because I know that I'm gonna pass on to someone else in the future
I just like that
I think I really like it about
they're the things that sort of the cons
Then that might ruin the natural offline aspects of it
And the thing that I don't like as well is the pricing which I'll come to in a mode
I don't think it's very well-priced.
I think it's designed for more of a premium market
I know that from seeing some of the videos they do and all that
It's to help you get away from that environment
With an iPad
you will get sons more value honestly if you when you look at the price
This tablet is designed to get you away from that environment
Flowing it doesn't necessarily I notice like even backers noting.
They're like, it's okay to use this
it doesn't distract
Me too much then say a phone with note of notifications and The other question
I'm getting from new
folks is like
how good is it in terms of the sketching abilities?
And again, I would probably give this about a 7 out of 10
I would say the iPad with the Apple pen from using it
beforehand is definitely more accurate
So you're looking at the price of a basic iPad as you can imagine that is steep
This is actually the first edition
There are now two two editions as of this video
But you can get refurbished models on the site for like fifty dollars less
But again Apple tend to wrap on huge Prices for their pens or keyboards or accessories
or even going up a model so you may actually be spending a bit more
Apple depending on what you go with
now, let's talk about the markers that you get with that
Now the marker the basic mark you get is $59 so you can buy the pen
separately, which means you then add up to 550
But I believe there sometimes you starter packets which include it for free
But if you wanted a signature on its own, I believe that's 99 bucks.
So the signature pen is definitely nice
It's a really nice build quality and I really like the click
Then it makes when you utilize it, but that has no value at the same time
But I really like the pen then it comes with as I said the tips
If you get an 8 pack that you need for the top of this pen then it's gonna be 12 bucks
So that's gonna add on and the additional thing is if you want a folio with it
Which is either a leather design or this sort of canvas II design
so you can definitely see why this is more of a premium Experience.
It's definitely look
But my opinion is I really like this device.
I'm continuing to use it as you can imagine
You know because I've actually found a huge amount of value from
its taking me away from the screen
It's also giving me a paper like experience
But then I've never had an iPad
just take note into that
I think and it's allowed me a bit more creative freedom
You're probably just saying pick up some paper
Francesca because it would be a lot cheaper
I'm looking to get an iPad soon
I'm gonna look at the rocket book and put it against this
I'm also gonna look to get the remarkable 2 tablet
are there updates in that one looked a lot more attractive with the design?
So, let's see.
I will be doing more videos about this
I'm very impressed with this
and if you have one
Please do share your description your experience in the description below or the comments below
Thank you so much for stopping by.
I really hoped you enjoyed this feature and I will talk to you all very very soon
Cheers, everyone. Bye
hello and welcome to circle pupils first review video kind of refreshing right full disclosure
I was contacted by Hume and they asked me if I wanted to do
a review of this tablet and as we wanted to expand the kind of content
we do here at circle people for quite a while now
I thought this would be an amazing opportunity to start before we get started
I also want to say that this is not a paid review
i poise or any other in the circle
people stuff it does not get any monetary gain from doing this review
right now
the tablet comes in nice with simplistic box
included in the box
is the tablet itself
nobody will ever know for nebs with an in remover and also the usual driver desk and user manual
now let's get into a technical side of things
this does make quite a big difference for me
i as a former mouse player instantly felt more comfortable
the higher the polling rate the less delay there will be from you
LPI which means lines per inch
the reading height of the tablet is around 1.5 centimeters
not that high
it's the one thing
I feel that it makes my a more stable
I guess the pen uses two one AAA battery
which as I've said it's not included
you can choose if you want that a little heavier or a little lighter
suddenly the pen itself feels really good
well I get
it's very compact
and you could call it premium
it has three buttons
two of them are on the side of the pen
where you grip and you can change to do whatever you want
I'll talk more about that in the driver
part of the video and the other button is on top of the pen
and it's the power button and it's in the shape of an eraser which
I think it's pretty cool design
it's like a real pen
all of these buttons have a really satisfying click to them
I'll just play it up here one thing
I noticed as a drag player is that the first week or so the nib will act a bit like a spring
whenever you push on it
it doesn't take up a lot of space on your desk
I really do love how it looks like
I found a bit irritating as a dragon player
is the light every time depend
that is the tablet
a green light is turned on is
don't understand why at least give me the option to turn it off and there is another weird thing
I noticed the first time might use the tablet
I compared to two other tablets
now let's take a look at the drivers for this tablet
unfortunately it's not much to hang in a Christmas tree
it does to work but not efficiently or in any good manner
it is pretty lightweight needs to install but that's kind of where the good stuff ends
I have had problems with it
I don't really know what it is and I never got it to work at all
there is no good way to do this unfortunately hopefully
Shion will release an update this somewhere in the future
I think this tablet can be the right choice
thanks for watching this review
so my friends from gaomon sent over another tablet for us to try now
i have to think of something anime
alright i guess it's time for a new intro
then i had an idea that included going to this bridge which was a whole hour long bike
ride away from my place but hey the bridge was aesthetic as so it's worth in the end
i guess right plus i have my friend with me so i wasn't so lonely
shout out to my boy
wonderflunky he streams by the way follow him on twitch
alright so i got my footage time to animate over it
we also get to try out this brand spanking new tablet that was sent over from galman
this is the pd 2200 tablet
it's pretty hot like look look at this
look at the box it came in
jeez you already know
we gotta get into the specs
the pd 2200 is equipped with a full laminated 92 ntsc 21.5 inch hd display
the pen also doesn't need to be charged so no batteries
no extra wires and a super light pen
there are also eight touch keys on the side of the monitor
that's right touch
we really living in the future here
he's a panda and panda is eat bamboo bambootie so yeah
make sure you check out the links in the description if you're trying to cop
a new drawing tablet on sale the pd2200 was such a nice tablet to animate on
they cool and all but i kept accidentally touching them whenever i grab the tablet on the side
guess it'll just take a little getting used to
would i recommend this tablet
hell yeah for this price point
the tablet is so worth it
and hey if you're interested in getting a tablet and this is still way over your price range
i'm actually planning to give away the tablet
anyway that's the end of the tablet review
here's the finished product and our new intro
see y'all later you
my favorite tablets are 8-inch tablets and I reviewed pretty much
every 8-inch tablet that was released in the last couple of years
i'm andrea for my next table
you can buy right now
is the Apple iPad Mini 5
that was released in 2019
so this is a very sharp screen
you can buy right now
I was in 15 minutes for this test
below the screen is the touch
of course
you can connect a mouse by now
that's quite multitasking
and the files up of course the iPad Mini 5 is the best 8 inch tablet
you can buy right now
it's only real
downside is the design
it is very well a bit but it does look a bit
oh it sadly there's no premium
Android tablet right now that I can really comfortably recommend the next best one
and even though it's a bit older it is still the fastest 8 inch android tablet
you can buy right now
and it does have many premium features for instance
it has a very pretty 8.4 inch IPS screen with a very high resolution of 2560 by 1600 pixels
inside the media pad m58
runs a queueing 960 processor
one time was 11 hours
there's no pen support though it
does everything up in scanner which sits underneath the screen
the immediate pad m58 is running
Android 8 yes is that it's a bit older
I don't forget any major updates anymore and the media
I'm not sure how secure that is
you can buy right now but again
they are a bit older so I would strongly suggest you to check out the iPad Mini 5
I'm only putting this on this list to make this list complete
it does promise an 8.4
inch IPS HD screen Full HD screen and an external 7904 processor
I can super comfortably recommend I really love it is the Samsung Galaxy Tab
it supports all these standard
8 tablets are getting 2 updates but
I can't promise anything of course because I am NOT Samsung
yeah this is really one of my favorite 8 inch tablets the S Pen works great but yes
sadly chances are pretty high that you won't be able to get it easily
which is a mid-range 8 inch tablet
that was only released in a couple of countries like India Thailand and so on just an 8 inch IPS
screen with a full
HD resolution of 1920 by 1200 and it's a pretty nice HD Full HD screen
I like that
we're getting a mostly metal body here
it is running
at m5 light 8 is a great alternative to both these
Samsung tablets
I mentioned if those are not available in your country
it's a nice mid-range tablet the next standard on this list is the
Lenovo tab m8 which I really enjoyed
it's a lower end to mid-range tablet but it's a pretty nice
8 inch tablet you can get versions with an HD screen and with the full HD screen
it heavily performed very well with 20 3.5 hours
it's an 8 inch and whatever but it's a low-end tablets it's similar to the Lenovo
it is noticeably weaker than the S Pen version or than the 8.4
it is running a car comes
Networking 429 so again
the certainly is not a gaming tablet
the battery life was pretty good with 13.5 hours in my standard test
the big quality is ok
it is running and what 9 including one
I'm not speaking for Samsung
it's not amazing
but it's fine and again you probably will get two updates the cheapest 8-inch tablet that
the Amazon Fire HD 8 has an 8 inch screen it's an IPS panel with 1280 by 800 pixels
Amazon doesn't say what it is it is OK
you can't open two apps side by side
I mentioned here because of that but it is worth it
you can install them yourself
it's a bit of work and I wouldn't recommend your grandmother doing it alone
if this has been the best 8 inch tablets you can buy right now
I'm Andrea for my next table
comm thanks for watching and see you next time
so look who got a package in the mail today
hello everyone my name is
this is neat box
I really like this
has like a cute little design on it and so right on the back
I don't really understand like the pen writing angle of 60 degrees
I don't know how that helps but it sounds good to me
the report rate is 265
open ooh almost there not very experienced with bosses
whoa and here is a tablet
it's pretty good science
this is honestly the biggest tablet
I have ever see if I can get it out
oh here is everything
so let's look at the tablet first so again this is pretty good size the largest tablet
I ever myself usually
I just have like really small tablets
I don't know I just so it's gonna be exciting to try something bigger for once
oh this is fun
yeah that's got like this nice cloth bag
I really do like it
it's got the keys on the side so
it's nice sleek so let's get into some of these other things so there's this which
let me just get this off first
so yeah basically
I'm pretty sure the idea is like to replace your nib
you couldn't stick it here and then pull out
this is pretty cool
I like this really liking these designs
so far let's see what else is in the package
there's the wire which obviously every tablet needs unless it's wireless
I'll be back in a second
let's see this glove again
I love a little package for this just like I love this little tight
oh and it's got a pretty design on it too
let's see if this even fits my hand though looks pretty big
okay yeah it fits
it's a little big but um it doesn't really matter to me because
I personally don't use these clothes
I'm not sure what this is for
it's a little cloth
oh maybe for cleaning the toilet
Oh read about it in a minute
that's like a neat little package to keep it nice and protected
I can get it off so yeah I like this pen
it's a it's a cool design
you can click stuff on here again
I think that's about it
it's honestly pretty crazy so anyways today
I'll be reviewing part was a 6/10 plus drawing tablet
I found that the tablet was honestly really amazing
I mean I was initially shocked by
how could the pressure was which is really saying something
I'll admit that I found that
the design at the tablet is pretty cool though the back being covered of cloth
I also really loved how the surface of the tablet felt
it's just so nice and smooth honestly
it's super satisfying to just rub my hands against it a little weird
I wanted to talk about the pressure
the pressure is absolutely astounding
in fact it was so good
I find
is that damn good so while it does take some getting used to
it is 100% worth it
I also wanted to talk about the size of the tablet
the size is pretty damn good for $70
I've seen much smaller town
I found that my lines were naturally smoother in a lot of cases as well
it's honestly really cool to actually feel like
I have a lot more breathing room when compared to my last tablets
and don't get me wrong
all these hotkeys being 100% customizable to your liking
a pen with 9 amps
total a pen
stand a cloth specifically for cleaning the tablet a drawing glove and a USB cord
it really feels like the artists were taken into deep consideration with this product which
I can really appreciate
I also really loved the packaging
I know I said it before
but it's worth mentioning again
the packaging was so good and safe
you can really tell that there was a lot of care put to the product which is something
I can also really appreciate and finally the price is amazing
it's only $70 and it's a really really really good deal
it's a big tablet performs exceptionally and will last a long time
I think I should go over the cons that I discovered
but don't worry
I honestly didn't find anything major
the most annoying thing about the tablet is whenever
I touched the pen to any sort of surface
I hear a little cooking sound
but it's definitely noticeable
this is honestly something
I really really didn't like something
I really appreciated about wakeup and the hue on is that I could use them both interchangeably
the thing is that if this is your only tablet or you don't plan on switching between tablets
my other drivers
I honestly don't think I'll really be using my other ones now that I have this
this isn't an issue for me at all
don't take away from the quality of the product at all in fact
I was struggling to find any cons at all
you'll also notice
I think that this tablet is absolutely amazing the pressure sensitivity is stellar
the size is great and it comes with a lot of great extra stuff and it's a great price
I mean I find it so surprising
in fact part of me is honestly expecting a ton of people to comment and say that they knew what
I'm going to say despite all the hate she gets
because we've never really seen anything like this before the vast majority of people
I've seen talk about this and talk about how crap is she
isn't how ridiculous it was that she could even blame
Jay feather at all without even looking at her point of view
in fact the truth is she never really blamed
Jay feather she always blamed herself all right
maybe she did actually make herself believe it was
how would you feel knowing that it was your own advice
that led your brother to his untimely death
you would feel absolutely horrendous
you would never be able to escape the guilt but wait
tail killed rather than herself
and while
this isn't right
most of the time your mind will do this subconsciously
in order to ease your anxieties
so she's not entirely at fault here in my opinion
Rhianna Singh your own advice got your brother killed to be horribly traumatic
the idea that it wasn't her that got her own brother killed
she says how the medicine cats all seem to be acting strange
and that japheth are inflamed
he'll are likely having some quarrels
this leading to flame tails murder
Don Pelt is noted to have been acting weird ever since poem tales death
I believe this showing how torn apart
she is emotionally after
Tiger hurt Tony Pelt and Rowan CAW are not acting differently though they may be sad
Todd's feelings but makes it clear to them that she's mainly just hurt
she later accuses
Jay feather of being a murder at the gathering causing a huge fight
if everyone else believes it
why shouldn't she
it's also none of that
she wants an excuse to be angry with others instead for what happened
which is why
well it's not good to blame others and go to such lengths
I really hope I've convinced some of you to feel the same
I'll also have larger print sizes available for just a few days but enough about Don pelt
I'd like to talk about the tablet again for a few brief moments
I think that Pablo is an amazing tablet especially at the price
the quality is absolutely amazing
and you can tell about a lot of care was put into it which
I can really appreciate if you guys are interested in purchasing this tablet which
I highly recommend you
do you can check out the description to find the purchase link and a coupon code anyways
that's all for now
I really got hope you guys enjoy the video
it was a lot of fun to make
I'll see you all next time
good bye for now
how far does this think ahead and will this
carve a new niche for a declining tablet market
I'm Kevin the tech ninja this is the Nokia in one tablet review
Nokia brought a premium build to the n1 tablet starting with the materials
the n1 is an aluminum
the back surface is smooth
look and it makes it very pleasing to hold
the tablet layout is pretty familiar volume rocker on the right side
there's no traces of any type of rattling or loose parts
as far as design the n1 feels great and you can compare it to any tablet on the market
it's a fully laminate
at first glance colors can appear a bit dull to some after doing a few color tests online
I found that the colors are extremely accurate
nokia chose to go with a natural color profile which is easier on the eyes
the text is decently sharp on the panel but not the sharpest
I've seen for most cases 324
PPI is fine just zooming in on text is not as crisp as other devices
one thing that I found
is that if you put any pressure on the display
you'll notice some color bleeding
I was not really familiar with this chip starting off after digging into it
it seems like a very capable chip the SOC integrates a power VR g60 430 GPU
we also have 32 gigabytes of on-board storage and 2 gigabytes of ddr3 800 megahertz
Ram it weighs just 318 grams as well to keep everything juiced up
inside we have a 5300 milliamp battery as mentioned earlier this is using the new
USBC connector and it's honestly a joy to use the USBC cord is reversible
beefy specs are only half the story with this device
the tablet provides a smooth and consistent experience throughout all the menus and applications
a great example is when playing plants vs. zombies on some devices
there's a lot of action on the screen
it does slow down a little bit well
this tablet had no slowdown issues
at all it just ran at the same frame rate as it ran if there was just one plant on the screen
another example is a game like fruit ninja
where there's a lot of action on the screen pretty much the whole time
play this game out of android tablets
this is one of the best performing ones
battery life for standby was impressive
the n1 tablet is Android 5.0.1 lollipop
and it has a custom launcher on top called the launcher
C launcher is a simple launcher
that only consists of two screens
neither so you can type in
it's not perfect
there are a few times where it does not register your finger inputs and what
I found that works
best is just keep riding until it eventually shows up now
there is something to know about this launcher
that is still in beta
great for a tablet now beyond this launcher which is very simple
it's still running a pretty much stock version of
Android are there
when you're playing it on your tablet and also z launcher settings
which lets you tweak to z launcher a bit more
none of these are anything that would change the game of Android
that just looks bad
the front-facing camera provides you with the same story
a lot of images come out yellowish and has a lot of grain
even in well-lit areas now as far as camera software it is using stock software
I got to be honest here
it's a big disappointment that this camera isn't that great everything else
the tablet is great in high quality and premium
but the camera is just lacking
I don't walk around taking pictures with my tablet
it ran fine now as far as hardware
it ran all the applications without an issue z
launcher does the job as well and I like it for a tablet launcher but it is replaceable
so if you don't like the Z
launcher you can throw on any third-party launcher that
I will have no problems
offer my recommendation of this tablet as always guys my name is

you know to do if you like this video
while you're down there go ahead and leave a comment as always guys
i'm kevin the tech ninja
you can find me on youtube and on google+ and this is android authority your source for all things

hi everyone mahmoud is here today i will review another graphics tablet
this is a brand new 2021 model xp pen deco mini 7w graphics tablet
it is wireless and a little bit bigger than small size tablets
so it's interesting
let's get started xp pen
released deco mini 7 last hour
and this is mini 7w
it's the wireless version of that model
and it looks very similar to the bigger brother xp pen deco 01 version 2 right the same design
but this is wireless deco
01 version 2 is about 70 us dollars
this is about 60 us
dollars and mini 7 non-wireless version is about 50 us dollars on amazon
this video is not sponsored
by the way i received the product free for an exchange of my honest review okay
let's do a quick unboxing first and then i will review guys xp pan deco mini 7w graphics tablet
the tablet comes in this box
and here's the mini 7 wireless graphics tablet
i like the design
it's good and it has a matte surface
my favorite there are eight custom
build buttons on the tablet
there is a usb c port for charging and the on off button
here this is the back side with four rubber feet
here's the pen
it's a new generation xp pen stylus
of course it's a battery free stylus
it looks comfortable
there is a rubber grip here and as always there are two side buttons on the pen
this is the usb-c cable
it's a really good quality
cable guys i like it
here is the usb receiver for the wireless connection
we have a lot of extra nibs and a nip remover here
these are android mod adapters one micro usb and one usbc and manuals
the tablet has a plug and play option
but i am going to download the driver and show you how it looks like
you can find the website link in the description below
click the link go to xpand.com
choose the category
here's the software
it has settings about working area monitors express keys and pen side buttons
ok let's check the top bit now
the tablet is wireless
i am going to connect this usb receiver and start checking
i will use pdf annotator for that
let's start writing okay
writing is good
the tablet surface is smooth and the pen is really comfortable
i like it
you can see my writing guys
they look natural and they're clean right
yes everything is good
you can also teach online with your android device
i am using usbc
adapter comes with a tablet by the way i couldn't use it with the usb receiver in android mode
that's why i am connecting the cable
now okay you need to use the tablet vertically in android mode and you can write it just like that
this is a hobby android device and you see the pointer is visible on the screen
it's time to talk about pros and cons
i will start with pros
the tablet surface is great
it is matte and matte
surfaces are best for online teachers
the target is slim
it's not the slimmest one but it is slim it looks modern and the best part is guys
the tablet is wireless
so you don't need to worry about the cables around you
you can just charge your tablet after your lessons
it is really really good and cons one thing
there is no panholder in the package and usually small size graphics
tablets do not come with pen holders they can make their own pen
um yes
it's actually a good idea
oh you remember the picture right
i showed you yes
i have a friend guys rui fernandez from portugal
he's one of my viewers so he sent me his setup
and i'm gonna show you guys you can also create a pen holder
um something like that if you need okay

I forgot to set press
this set it up so you have this instead of like
Google they have this quill junior calm
there's so many adjustment that you can make as your kids grow it's brilliant
so bye for now
hey everyone mukul here with another huion product review because wacom doesn't know me yet.
yes just bear with it.
well in a new or at least new for me
huion launched this in three colors black purple and green and i received the black one to review.
let's first see what all you get in the package.
the box art is nice and subtle and that game
art doesn't mean that it's asking you to play games on it.
like all the premium stuff from huion
the box quality is excellent
you get a battery free pen
which is very light and kind of looks different to my huion
wh1409 v2's pen.
this pen claims to have a new pen tech 3.0 on it and it would feel more organic as you use it.
that's what they are claiming.
you also get a pen
you also get a manual
the packaging will look like a cd
but it's not a cd.
huion clearly thought to be nostalgic with its appearance this time.
the cloth is there to wipe the screen and a glove to protect the screen from the smudges
so that you don't need to wipe the screen with the cleaning cloth.
the loop of life.
the inclusion of an extendable cable is smart.
and if you already had a spare one then well let's just say it's still a spare one.
the hdmi port is for the display signal
the usb port is for the pc to recognize the device and the third red usb
is there in case the earlier
two ports somehow failed to give enough power to the tablet.
so this is where the extendable cable comes in handy and yeah there is no power adapter
this time in the box
use the phone charger
and that's also what the manual said.
and because the size of this tablet is 13 inches
it will not ask for much power draw anyway.
compared to other bigger display tablets out there.
but anyway make sure to suspend your usb saving options in the power plan settings on windows.
your phone's charges to give sufficient power to the tablet.
but who in the whole wide world doesn't like free stuff or cables or adapters
i'm sorry about that.
or am i not.
or am i.
and it also has these anti-slip rubber feet on the bottom.
okay now back to the elephant in the room pun might have been intended.
it's about 980 grams
so lighter than your laptop and 11.8 mm thick in comparison
the ipad pros are only 5.9
mm in thickness.
so it's not a light or super slim display tablet for sure.
the screen is full
hd 13 inches with a 120 srgb color gamut.
i have been spoiled by a 4k screen so full hd feels like feels a little congested to me
but that's just me.
and because of the size it feels super compact
the screen has a super matte
finish on it.
but that didn't affect anything i had to do with the tablet.
right after i installed the driver software as admin
it restarted
my pc but it didn't ask for a restart on the laptop but once when i opened the software
uh it then also showed me this button to activate it as admin
mwhich was kind of odd.
make sure you select this screen as the active screen in the driver software.
as i tested the tablet with photoshop the experience was surreal.
the feel of the nib to the screen and its feedback was smooth and fluid
and by stuff i mean art.
the lines in pressure felt perfect
like the recent huion products i tested and working on
this was a true joy
there is an almost very minor parallax on the screen
thin lg has made extremely slim tv panels
so let's see till when companies like huion etc acquired
that tech for their display tablets.
even working on zbrush was actually pleasurable.
oh and you can also work on your androids with this tablet
they have posted a list of compatible devices on their website
it's a usb c 3.1 gen1 with dp 1.2 as mentioned earlier.
and i have no idea why have i just repeated it.
now the only thing left for these tablet is to go wi-fi.
now let me come on to the few drawbacks of this tablet.
the tablet lies flat on the table and as there is no stand available right in the box for many
this might cause an issue.
if you sit upright which is the healthiest way to sit
for long hours you would find some variations in the screen colors.
so a stand would be a must to use this tablet with.
especially if your eyes for colors are extremely peculiar.
as you can see here there is a very slight variation which happens as your viewing angle changes.
that's just not practical and healthy.
i've tried and used in the past now
it's quite heavier than ipad or a surface pro
then why bother.
the benefits of these tablets are its price and the hardware upgrade convenience.
but at 21000 rupees or 250 us dollars or 230 pounds
you can't really get those.
so this is where the market of such tablets will keep on existing and will never cease.
i believe for most of the artists it will be an essential accessory to avoid that
slight screen variation.
and for a healthy upright setting posture too.
so anyway make sure to get other
third party stands available on aliexpress or amazon
or just make sure you add one whilst placing your order in the very first go.
in summary the overall feel of working with this tablet is top notch.
another good worthy product by huion.
that's all for today.
MuBot out. That was a long freaking video man.
how long is it. is it longer than the hobbit.
what is going on guys
welcome to Greg
Iles this is gonna be a review slash unboxing for the Vanco matrix pad s7 tablet
this is a 7-inch tablet runs
Android 9.0 has two gigabytes of RAM 32 gigs of storage 5 megapixel camera
on the back as well as a camera on the front up there
IPS display FM radio
GPS Wi-Fi only and it comes in the color of black
so let's put this off to the side
I do have it all set up but let's first check out what comes inside of this box
USB cable which it was USB C charging but it is micro USB
there's something to keep in mind when you get this
I don't know I never look at these things
that's actually pretty cool that they give that to you as well
so the matrix
Pat s7 tablet has a 7-inch display the resolution on it is 1024 by 600
so it's not like you know 720p or 1080p but you can see the angles are freakin amazing on this
you also have your button that turns the power off on the left hand side
no buttons at the top
here this is where you gonna have a lot of the button
so you'll have a button that allows you to plug in a headphone headphone
jacks are rare these days you also have a port to add additional storage up to 128 gigabyte micro
what game better to check out
that's a not too crazy than subway surfers
so let's get that loaded up
I'm gonna turn the volume down but one thing about the speakers
I don't think so no
I never play this game though
there's no slowdown
this should work great with that kind of stuff
oh there you go
I did but anyways you saw it played perfectly fine next up
maybe you're into consuming media
YouTube for instance
it's obviously gonna be able to do that so being open up
YouTube and go to my favorite youtuber in the whole world
Greg loves to be and let me play one of these videos
you can see got my video playing
let me put the volume up
good very impressed with the videos with a look
it is only one speaker on the back here
you're not gonna get stereo speakers but like
I said it doesn't sound that bad
also if you're looking to consume such you know other stuff such as Netflix or Disney
Plus this does that great as well open up
how about this pearl and I'm doing this stuff in real time
so you're seeing
they plays fine loads up fairly fast as well
so you
if your can into consuming media you should have no problems with this camera wise
I mean I'm not a huge camera person with with tablets
it's all the way up to five on the back and on the front camera
and let's go back here and you can check out
here's a camera
I took with the front-facing camera
hopefully you can see
it didn't call it that bad at all
especially you know for a tablet
here's another one
here's another one
I took with the back camera
kind of orientations
Google do well so if you want to do video calls you definitely can with this tablet and it will
do you know pretty much fine with it
battery life would this
you're gonna get up to eight hours of mixed use also you do get 32 gigabytes of on-board storage
I have it down here so I have a recent apps button
I have my home button
I have my open this up my back button and then I also have
it'll bring down my notifications and let me see my notifications
just you can see the performance of this
it's pretty good
it's it's for what you're getting you know in a competitive
the fire tablet the this that this actually runs
Android Android 9.0
it's nice you know the performance isn't that bad
the speaker isn't that bad battery
life is pretty good and you know it gives you like
you know pretty much anything that you want on it
so at that point as a media device to do video chats to surf the web
let me load up a website real quick here so
I'll load up my Greg
it's not bad at all loading up this little thing here and there you go everything works
thanks for watching
see you guys down the road boots
oh hey i'm mark
we're talking about a pen display tablet and a computer all in one
this is the canvas 22 studio
is that a couple of weeks ago
of course like i said
it's a computer and a graphic tablet fused into just one device
i've been using this for the last three weeks or so pretty much daily
so i've tested a number of different painting softwares
and then the rest of the review will be split in two parts
the first one will be looking at the actual computer inside this thing
and then we'll check out the actual tablet capabilities
how good does it feel to draw on this thing
and then we'll discuss
who is this for
and if it's worth the money here we go so before we open the actual tablet here
this was a an extra box that was included with a mouse
and a keyboard both wireless so very nice and nice addition nice touch
we're going to have um the power block so it's the power supply for the computer
wow so here we have this stand um to hold this computer tablet
looks uh i'm not gonna lie
it looks a little bit flimsy
so it's not a plastic film
it's an actual glass surface
which is very very nice
so i'm a big fan of that very similar to actually
it's the same as the wacom cintiqs in that
it's definitely not a portable device
this is a desktop device
and it's not meant to move around because it's it's pretty damn heavy
i won't be traveling with this
of course it is a computer after all it takes a couple minutes and then there you go
you have a brand new computer pen display tablet technology
now let's take a look at this machine see if it fits any good and so to test the computer itself
and so i'm sure for most of you
this won't mean much but here we can see that
the cpu is a core i5 8400
there's no dedicated video card so instead we have an integrated graphic card not the best
i will say though that you really should update your drivers as soon as you
all went away as soon as it was updated
and then in my case i have the model that has 16 gigs of ram
instead of eight those are the two options that you can get and of course
yeah here just looking at the temperatures stays pretty stable
that is quite demanding but it was never that bad
that would bother me it
yeah when it comes to the device itself
that's pretty much it
i think there's one more thing that i should point out and it is
the speakers are really really bad
because that's probably what most of you want to hear about as the name implies
this is a 22 inch tablet
it's only full hd so 1080p
i will say that it's feels a little bit outdated you know you can clearly see
the pixels would have been fine if it was 16 inches but at 22
yeah it definitely would have been better with at least qhd in terms of the colors
they look they look
okay okay to me
at least i didn't uh didn't calibrate anything
it seemed good enough to me now
i don't know but the distance feels negligible and so very little parallax
brush strokes are nice and smooth
there's no lag and there were like no dead pixels no dead spots or anything like that
everything was working as it should
you can also see on the side of the tablet here
we have in total like 20 different
you can set it to whatever you want
in my case i set it to disabled because i use the keyboard for all my hotkeys
it's definitely not hot and certainly not uncomfortable and i don't have it on film here
everything felt awesome
i was quite impressed drawing a straight line in my case i had no issue whatsoever
no waviness no jiggliness
at least so i had a bunch of layers and then this is a file
keep things at around a million active polygons and you should be pretty happy
the model that i have here has around seven million total
the drivers will completely crash
but when you're logged in as a single user the drivers do behave
i just wish there was a way to restart them like you can easily restart wacom
drivers without having to reboot your entire machine
maybe in a future update huion
yeah aside from that
well what happens if you want a different
maybe like a better tablet something that is 4k in the future
or what if you want to upgrade your computer to something
that's a little bit better
you have to ship your entire machine to get it repaired and so while it can be something
that's nice the fact that it's a standalone machine
you don't need a big computer box next to it only one cable
is this a good purchase
should you buy this and really who is this for so initially
my thought was that this was something that would be great for
you know for people that maybe uh are younger and have no computer
that can barely play solitaire in that case
yeah you know that might be a really really nice upgrade
i was thinking this might also be good for people that know nothing about computers
now of course the price now keeping in mind that this is a computer on top of being a pen
display tablet for the entry level
we're looking at around 1200 us dollars
so this is the version with eight
gigs of ram and 120 gigs
what you get
essentially is a mini computer
that costs 950 bucks with keyboard and mouse included
hell yeah that's probably what i would do
which is why we come to the conclusion that this device here
the canvas studio 22 is all about convenience
is it the canvas
studio 22 is for you so final words on this device here
well i had a really hard time finding something
is that big of a deal and the drawing part
i hope it was helpful and uh well if it was you know what to do
click that subscribe button
do it bro
that's it for me
i'll see you next foreign
hey everyone in today's video
I'm going to review the Pablo a 640 graphic drawing tablet this is a review unit provided by
Pablo the main selling point of this tablet is the price at the time of this review
this is priced at us $29.99
so this is less than us
$30 this is the tablet
it's a small tablet with a drawing area of 6 by 4 inches
and it's about the size of my hand so it's a pretty small
tablet design is pretty straightforward
I like the rounded corners
feel quality feels quite solid now the dots on the drawing area they remind me of the
Wacom Intuos step was released
in 2015
there are 4 shotgun buttons
these are sleep your cases for the pen
this is a pretty tight fit for the pen
the dry surface is pretty smooth
it has a matte texture feeling but overall it's considered quite smooth
this is the back where four rubber feet and that's the USBC port for the cable that is provided
this is a braided cable
so on one end this
the big logo is behind and the design
this pen is not powered by battery so no charging required other things included in the
Box are this
is the warranty in for a quick start guide six replacement nibs and knit remover
there is no driver this included
so you have to download the driver from their website
I have already installed the driver and this is on Mac OS for some reason
the driver is called
YJ driver so let's take a look at the features
so this is the mapping by default this will be mapped to the food display
switch here you can test the pressure sensitivity
there's no way for you to enter your own keys
open a web page or sign the button to a mouse click
I'm using a 27-inch monitor
this tablet is considered small for this monitor generally speaking
I recommend a graphic tablet that is Liz 10 by 6 inches
what this means is when you draw when you move a tiny bit on the tablet
you're going to get a very long line
it's really very sensitive and there is no lag
it's very responsive the drawing surface
it's quite nice to work with
it has like texture to it
it's a bit slippery but there is texture to it which makes it nice to draw on oops my Photoshop
it's lagging
that's not because of the tablet
it's my computer for the show
for some reason it has problem running on my computer and because there are only four
physical shocker buttons on the tablet
you're gonna have to rely on your keyboard for most of the keyboard shortcuts
I have no problems creating dots
you can draw very lightly to get those really thin lines
looks pretty smooth to me
Photoshop and it works pretty well
I did not notice any issues with this
this is me teabag paint
Pro for some reason the brush
it just doesn't work
this is creat our and pressure books
this is clip studio paint and as you can see pressure sensitivity
works really well so the only problem
I have with this tablet is with MIDI Bank paint
Pro on the Mac if you happen to be using this tablet on the Mac
our test is with
is this if you have more budget
I have reviewed those tablets before as well links are in the video description below
alright so thanks for watching this video
I hope this is helpful
see you in the next one bye
hey guys it's shad and today
I'm gonna be reviewing a 8.5 inch LCD writing tablet
let's go ahead and start the video
a lanyard strap two with a hole and also a battery slot plus any raise button
those are all the buttons on it
it's very thin this board
what clears out the whole board
the only downside to this is you guys cannot save your actual work the only way
I'm saving it is by taking a photo
it is actually really easy to write with this device
it is just like you're writing on a tablet or also on paper
it's not even that hard
but that's not that much of a downfall as you guys will actually be seeing it
what is good to last up to two years on different types of usages but around two years in the end
but it's actually really good if you think about it
h-e-b doulas how are you doing well
Wacom is Wacom not wake up
apparently there is a wha is a Japanese kind of circle of life thing calm
Computers the circle of life of computers
they have sent me an interest
created pen tablet
there's a choice
it comes with digital painting photo editing or comics and manga so
we have the box which is in this lovely
ooh kind of soft vinyl finish
and let's open it up and it is pistachio flavor yum yum yum yum yum
so let us see what we have
I should think let's see what else we got
we have got actually gentle with this
we got a rocker switch
so we've got kind of two buttons and we have got
now cross the top here
we have a brass keys and you can excite assign these buttons to be anything you want
there can be multiple keystrokes any command on your computer
I'll show you that in a moment
so this is our introduction thing it tells you what you've got
it stopped flashing at me
now plug it in it says go to
so let's go and plug this in and see how it works now
I've just plugged in the interest and this into our setup
wizard appear so it says pen buttons
it's letting you know you press the button on the pen
so that's the back button
I'm hovering over to right-click
Wacom ID to start the process
you self-employed freelancer
use it for my job
I've registered the welcome into a small BT pen pistachio view the software library
select your free bundle software
I'm gonna add that to my library and then I'm also gonna want this clip studio paint
I'm going to download that now and I'm going to download no so that is cool
I have to press quite hard to get to the end
and that's sort of somewhere in the middle of course the tip double-click distance
I can't feel any difference in that at all
okay so now
these are the little keys on the pan so the background
if you click is a right click and at the moment
have you know stroke modify
what does that come up with keys
let's just keep it there for the moment
I find really quite tricky
so let's go back to pen mode
I feel a lot happier in pen mode
so if you draw a circle you will get a circle on the screen
if your unforced
I have no idea what that is about
you can enjoy all the wonders of that on your own so with the tablet here like
take your option off and here
you can set the pen up so that the different click
things are suited particularly to that programs
it's kind of everything that you're gonna need to go and of course you can look up on
YouTube there's going to be loads and loads of things on there too now
this is clip studio paint
and you can see
it's a pretty massive kind of thing
there's an awful lot to learn here
I'm not really a digital artist
I like to draw on paper mostly and but I do coloring on Photoshop
let's draw with a pen
there we go so this is a pencil and we can choose up here
oh pest pastels
what have we got crayon chalks
it's like that
let's try something a bit bit bigger
try a big one like that and it looks like we can kind of do vector lines here as well
I'm not really quite sure
you are gonna have so much fun learning what this is all about
we got kind of spray cans
what have we got on this thing
I have idea
that's the kind of different patterns
what is that happening
I have no idea there is so much here for you to learn
this is free and this is not amateur at all
this is really quite amazing
I've no idea what these things are for timeline
so that obviously means that you can do animations on here as well
I presume over here just like Photoshop
we've got layers
this looks like an amazing program to get you started and with the
Intuos tablet pen
you can have so much fun now
I discovered something really really cool about them now
I discover something really cool about the pen is if you unscrew it you can see can
I focus on that you get these three spare nibs sitting in the bottom there like that
why would you need to spare nibs well
you've got spendings in there
you can also get different curse pair nips you can get some that feel like felt tips
Wacom thing across the top
I've worked out what that is for
it's very very neat
they haven't paid me to make this video but can
I recommend it
I certainly can if you are a hobby digital painter or hobby somebody
I'll tell you one thing I don't actually use among us at all
I only use a Wacom pen
Wacom pen when I used a mouse
I was clicking away all day and I found I was getting started to get RSI and pains in my arm
I since I swapped over to using a Wacom pen no problem at all
I recommend it
I certainly again
well thanks for watching
hi this is
we've got applications that are sort of desktop style
applications and the Windows Start screen support for all sorts of touchscreen applications
it has a magnetic docking mechanism
Acer also has a 10-inch model
this is the 11 inch model
that has a more powerful processor
this version was loaned to me
by Acer and features a core i3 Broadwell processor 4 gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes of storage
and again it runs the full windows desktop style
applications sells for between 450 and $600 depending on where you buy it and at 450
I think you know it's a
I think it's a little bit of a tougher
I've typed with this on my lap and actually had to fall over onto the floor
Acer says you should be able to get up to six and a half and depending on how you use it
maybe you can get a little bit more than I have
which is what you tend to find in the cheaper
Windows tablet range
it's got a nice build quality on the tablet the keyboard section
we'll get to in a second here but the over here we've got a headset jack
windows button power and volume keys front-facing stereo speakers a front facing webcam
there's no webcam reset button
microphone my credit card slot micro
I believe there are some models that have a 500 gigabyte hard drive in here
the tablet itself has 128 gigabyte solid
that's good open something up here
we can do some typing so type in works just fine
it's it's not my favorite touch pad
that's sort of your default
125 percentage resolution
this is if you didn't even do that
everything gets really tiny and hard to read
you might not necessarily need to do that but while
I do like the option of being able to say
put two windows side-by-side and a web browser
I'd rather be able to read the text
that's in both of those windows then
have everything looked too tiny
they're reasonably loud
I mean they're at their tablet speakers
they're not the best sounding that I've heard but they'll do in opinions
10 which has continuum for switching back and forth between tablet and desktop modes
it goes away but it can be a little bit disconcerting
Windows 8.1 I think there's a better job of balancing desktop and tablet modes then
Windows 8
did it can still get a little awkward from time to time so anyways
that's that's a quick look at sort of Windows 8.1 running on the Acer Aspire switch 11
it's not my favorite two-in-one device
I'm not sure how often you're likely to do that anyway
this is the h 610
yeah there's pressure sensitivity about 8000 levels of it
yeah it even has tilt functionality
we'll see more on that in a minute
why is drawing on
Android so special anyhow
I think through a lot of you
especially those of you
who subscribe
who are regulars here
there is a price to pay for that often times
this is a pretty cool thing
so let's take a look at this thing
let's dive in and see what it's like to draw with
I've done over on my website
I'll put a link it down in the description for that
the tablet itself has a live area of ten inches by six point to five inches
that's the space on the display that you can draw on
Goldilocks size too
small and it feels cramped too big and the porridge is gonna burn your tongue
I don't remember how Goldilocks ends
my point is is this is the size that I like to draw
it's really light and thin but also sturdy
it's made of plastic and it's the type of plastic
you would expect in a fairly inexpensive device like this
it loves finger prints
some people collect action figures
some people collect stamps
this collects finger prints
the build is good enough
it doesn't feel premium but it doesn't feel bad either
I knew that after drawing three lines on it I would never be able to get it fully
but you're probably not buying this to take pictures of it
we do have some customizable shortcut keys
there's also the zoom wheel you can scroll in resize your brushes do that sort of thing with it
it's calibrated pretty well too
what are these numbers yelled grandpa bear as he guzzled his porridge
those are soft keys
what the heck is a soft keys screamed
grandpa bear while destroying a rocking chair
their tap opal shortcut keys
and they're customizable just like the other shortcut keys
I went in and I set them to a whole bunch of different shortcuts
just to see how they work there
okay you just tap them to switch between tools it's fine
they're probably getting away
I was wondering that too am I ever gonna accidentally tap them in my time using it
they haven't even though they butt up right against the live area of the tablet
to accidentally toggle settings on and off the texture of the tablet itself feels good to draw on
it's a little bit textured
it has some tooth there so it gives it a very natural drawing feel
you might be wondering
won't that texture wear out my pen
nibs well yeah
the pressure comes out
at a good rate it holds that pressure
well around curves drawing slow angle
it's going to be more than adequate so using this on
Windows or on a Mac
this is exactly what I expected but what about Android this is the new feature
let's talk about that in the box
you don't need any extra software
you don't need any apps it just works
you can't go in and change your shortcut keys but out of the box
I was pretty impressed with how well this works
playing around with
this tablet in sketchbook is legit pressure is working and it's working
well your lines look good in fact they might look better than they do on
Windows when I plugged it into my Android tablet which is a Samsung Galaxy Tab
A with S Pen
it worked really well
I didn't come into any conflicts
found the lines to be smooth and I was genuinely surprised at how nice it was to draw with
it's a cheaper smaller version of this tablet
without as many bells and whistles
going with the lower-priced tablet all right now
I was wondering since this works on Android
would it work on a Chromebook Chromebooks can run Android apps
I wonder if have a Chromebook sitting around here somewhere
I have to talk to you again beep
Kansai - yeah softly
sleep hurry up
I'm not singing anymore
I'm just curious
we have friends with kids and in school a lot of times these kids look at these
Chromebooks to work with and do papers on and and surf the Internet
I guess and the parents asked me
hey my kids interested in art
what kind of drawing hardware can I get for this Chromebook
that they already have that they can use and learn with and my answer is usually oh those
Chromebooks just aren't meant for that anyway
I plug this in and it kind of works again
sketchbook is pretty decent and I get some good lines here
there is one major caveat
there is no pressure sensitivity here if you need pressure sensitivity
I don't think this is gonna work for you
that is a big feature of a drawing tablet
but if you're cool with not having any pressure and all you want is something that's accurate on a
Chromebook this works
what do you think
let me know down below in the comment section
that is all
I have for today
thank you guys for watching
I'll see you in a couple of days
and considering that you're getting a such a huge tablet for just 900 rupees
i think this deserves some attention
well i know like such uh lcd
you know drawing pads or writing pads they can be used by a wide range of audience
it can be used by kids to practice
where without wasting paper
you can practice your line
work your circles perspective concepts you get the idea
i don't think we need that
and we have the tablet itself over here
yes this is the lock and unlock button
it's got a nice weight to it and it feels kind of natural
it feels like you're holding a pen or a pencil in your hand and when it comes to drawing
i think it's quite good
i think it's quite natural to know like right over this
that's right for 900 rupees
you are going to get your sensitivity as you can see with less pressure
the lines are nice and thin
i don't think you can see that in the camera
okay let me zoom it over here all right you can see over here maybe no okay
yeah okay and let's see how we can use these things so we can just you know if kids are using this
they can just practice their lettering and so on and students a square plus 2 a b plus b square
they can practice their equations
or if you're an artist you can just practice some nice line work
i would say right you can practice your line work
i would say i think this feels really good
is that in most of the tablets or things like that
there is no thing like the line is catching up to the stylus right
it is just you put down drag it just follows it instantaneously
there is absolutely no law no lag or anything and as i mentioned
let's say this is a network you can just uh where is that
yeah over here i have locked it now so now if i press the erase button nothing happens
this is a handy feature
i would say i've just unlocked it now
so yeah everything goes back and it when it comes to the power kind of consumption
they say that the battery which is inserted over here
i think it's two of the coin batteries
they say it lasts two years
i will be happy if the tablet lasts one or two years for me
i don't think the battery should last that long though
this is a good feature
this is a good addition
i would say and you can also take out your ruler
oops i don't think that is nice
you can take out your ruler
draw some lines like this and it's pretty good all right i would say that's it for uh this video
yeah and one more thing
there is a nice slot over here
let me focus over here where you can just slide the stylus like this pretty nifty
if i want to erase only a part of it now i should go ahead and clean up the entire screen
i wish this had the stylus
so yeah i think that's it for this video
uh i wish you all the nice weekend and i will see you all in my next one all right
thank you so much for watching and see you bye
hey guys for the past two months
I have been using a new graphic tablet here on HS 610 which means every true
so this is something
90 degree micro
I'm very impressed with the quality of the product
so here is the specs of the tablet
I'm using the first feature
is the touch ring
I can say it's very simple and clean
I'm not good at drawing but still it turns out good and as you can see right now
I'm using the tablet and it's very smooth
you can use it as your mouth guard so you can control your whole computer not only that
I have draw
hand-drawn these sketches with the pencil
so and over here the smoothness is really good as you can see to remove the background
I have painted over there in the edges that was really easy for me because I was using the tablet
I have used this tablet and it was functioning really well
I didn't have any problem with it
I edited some photos
that cure is a good
the functionality is good
there's no lag and it's so compatible with my Mac that I don't feel like I haven't used this ever
it is my first time using it and still
I feel like I have been using it for a while
and it's really good so in terms of performance wise
I don't feel any issue with it
I have been using for two month and I still feel like it's brand news
there's nothing wrong with this tablet and one more thing that
I want to discuss over here
is that customizing options
keys where you can customize so right now it's default some of these are default some of them
this is a spacebar so
which you can customize so practically right now
I'm using this this and these
a stylus pen has two buttons over here lower and the top one so at the bottom
I have kept it to brush because I want the shortcut brush or via so I've kept it to brush
click button so
I kept it like that and under work area
it's depends on you you can rotate the angle and anything is like so right now
I'm using it in pieces so I want the full area and apply it like this
so this is the default option
I you can draw light lines
it's just one thick line so the best option in the middle region
I received this tablet around here
so everything you see from here owns
I have used the tablet to create this
so it's like
I'm using more often
the tablet than the mouse and this has been really shift in my workflow
it has increased my speed and workflow
so here's a my latest editing file where
so it's just my opinion
so if you're big in there
it's a budget tablet but still give you the best performance you want from a tablet
it's pro level
you can do any work of this
I would like to have is the wireless support
it will make this tablet a perfect graphic tablet
so thank you yuan for this tablet if you want to check out this product
see you in the next video
hi everyone this video is going to be a review of the who
Yan Q 11k wireless graphics tablet and who yung actually sent me this tablet to review
thank you so much for sending it to me
I had a lot of fun playing around with it and testing it out
and just what
they're very sturdy thick secure boxes
you can tell it was safely packaged
there's a brown box
simple clean and very secure as well and it makes good use of the space inside the box
all the packaging is black and has little silver icons showing
what's inside everything which
I thought was really cool
so the main items that came in the box was a tablet itself
there is a pen
stand a box on there the install disc and the Quick Start Guide
we're kind of on top of each other
it is $119.99 u.s. dollars
there's a link in the description to the to the Amazon page
it is a wireless tablet but you can use it plugged
which is really really great
it's very responsive it has 233
PPS which is points per second and a 50 80 LPI which is aligned per inch from what I found online
that's what it's called
it has to be recharged and it lasts longer than all the other
who young pens
compared to other tablet pens of youth
it's about the same weight
it feels very natural
it's not too heavy not too light
it doesn't have an eraser on it but I never really use that anyway
they give you whatever function you want
stand as well if you want to store it in there
extractors built into the stand
that way
you'll never lose it
it'll never fall out so
my computer is just like a regular laptop
it's like 4 years old and I didn't have any problems with the tablet
communicating with my computer
I really like how
I really like that kind of texture
I don't like the glossy texture
I feel like the paper
texture gives it good resistance
it makes it feel more natural and you can actually customize the pressure sensitivity of the pen
that is really easy on your program to get thick and thin lines and the pen felt very natural
I'm more used to using a display tablet
so it was a little bit awkward for me to switch to this
I started to kind of get back into the swing of it and it was very comfortable experience overall
the tablet itself has like rounded edges
I got but I thought that was kind of interesting
with a tablet that's only 119
US dollars for being so large and so comfortable to work with overall
it's very sleek
I have no problems connecting it to my computer
there's no lag whatsoever
I've always wanted to try one of whom's tablets because I've only tried other
brands have never tried too young before so
I'm really happy that I got this opportunity
so thank you so much to who young for sending me this
I hope that you found this interesting
if you have any questions please leave them in the comments
Hilla here OS reviews
you're watching our hands-on review of the dragon touch k10
this is a budget
Android tablet that as the name implies has a ten inch display and it sells for just $100
so what specs you get for just $100 tablet
I think it will suffice
so with something like this might be good for reading some text books ebooks things like that
now here's a quick user manual
it's actually pretty dense
it's in full color
we have a micro USB cable for charging and a AC power adapter there
seems like there is a pre-applied screen protector
let's just peel off the
French layer here the first impressions as we are proceeding through
headphone jack a dedicated volume rocker
a power on/off key
the top houses a microUSB port for charging and a micro
HDMI port
it also gets decently bright when you're taking it outdoors if you want to crank up
so there's still a slight gap between the glass on the top and the display underneath
so if you pointed out the light just right you can see
there's a bit more of a depth there we are running on a very stock install of Android 8.1 Oreo
you can see there's no bloatware at all
there's just the standard
I think part of the reason is because of that
what's also kind of neat
it's actually a pretty good size in my testing
let's take a quick look at the speakers and video streaming from YouTube
next pausing things there takeaway is the speakers
do get pretty loud
and it's definitely a stereo pair so better than a mono speaker but it is quite tinny sounding
I would say for watching some quick YouTube videos
it's perfectly fine but it's definitely missing a little bit in terms of bass now
I can also do multitasking
by default
it's loading back the desktop site of the verge and you can see
it's actually doing a really good job
all the content seems to be loading along just fine including the ads and video content
some parts are taking a few seconds longer than maybe a flagship smartphone
it is running on android oreo 8.1
in terms of gestures
Play Store you can see just loads up really quickly here
that's a little lighter and it will run it back without any problems
plus it will take up less space to install as well loading things along you can see
it's not going to be quite as fast in terms of frame rates as maybe a flagship phone the latest
so that's more or less it for our hands-on review of the dragon touch K 10 for only $100
I would say that the quality has definitely improved significantly
you want something that is more stock
because you want to try out your own games and titles and customize the tablet
this might be something
that's a little bit easier to pick up and immediately start using it also has a physical
go for under a hundred bucks
you can check out more details if interested in the links down below but for now
that's been our video
thanks for watching
Q @os reviews that's been the dragon touch K 10
hello everyone in this video
I'll be reviewing this Samsung tablet
it's a Samsung Galaxy Tab
A 6 10.1
inch a 32 gig
Android tablet now this tablet
it's a decent mid-range tablet
is you can see that
he's very quiet slim as well
the logos at the top
he goes so go front camera as well at the bottom
you got the back button and the home button
okay on the right side he has
it takes a micro
SD memory card
he has the volume up and down button
and the power button okay
I'm just gonna switch it on so you can see
that's how he switches on on the left side
there's nothing there at the bottom
it has a speaker okay and to speak as you can see
and at the top we have takes a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and micro
that's how the tablet looks
okay so let me show you some few things
so wall of about this tablet is that is slim
you got a big screen easy to use
you can see that you know
we go a lot of features
he's so one thing is that you got a 10.1
inch M screen okay
we were resolution of 1920
x 1200 pixel it also has the IPS technology Bouin with a multi-touch screen
I can go to saying that we'll just show you something
we got the battery information the status the status gives you all this tax information
it also has a front camera of 3 megapixel rear camera of a mer pixel billion is 107 point
it takes a few other things as well like you had up to 13 hours of battery life
this the size of the sliminess of this is a eight point
two millimeters fin the way is 525
MJ we've to give them
you know manufacturer warranty
if there's any technical folks now you can see the advanced features
it tells you if you think if you all of things downloaded you tell you what
T delay how about battery life etc
okay and the security is you see here
these are the security things here
I go those have information like the connection
the sound their notification the display their wallpaper etc
okay so you got quite of good features boo in
so that's what
I like about this tablet
well the main figure that the screen is perfect
okay and it's very smooth to use honestly overall with avocado brands mostly
II can't get this full run around 150 pounds and it's worth it okay so I do highly recommend it
okay please do give a like and subscribe
hey guys in today's video
they range from $800 to $3,000 and they are super expensive
so the tablet comes with two rechargeable pens which have a charging cable a screen protector and
I could find that was pretty comparable to this
talent was Rackham Cintiq 13 HD interactive pen display and so
Wacom tablets that are newer and they're way more expensive
I found one that was about 16 inches I think and it was
I think $1600 so they're really expensive in general not that they're in a not good quality
I'm 100% sure they're amazing quality
I'm thinking that a lot of people who aren't really professionals
and they have to use the tablet like that for their living
I was thinking that display tablets are really cool
it would be cool if we could find cheaper alternatives them to some of the more expensive
it has eight Express keys in order
I don't use the expressed keys on tablets
it's kind of hard for me to use those
I used them for about half of the drawing then
it just went by faster for me
you can adjust the tablet to be almost horizontal to your table or vertical
and it's just it depends on however you wish to have it
she's pretty new
some kind of knocking down her design to kind of basic
just boy tablet and so one thing
I really want to let you know about before you buy this
tablet and any display tablet
I think in general is make
just because when the tablet arrived for me
I realized that I did not have an HDMI port in my computer and what
I just I have room for more graphics cards one that had an HDMI port
just make sure that it has a mini display port or an HDMI port
install the tablet restart your computer and everything is good to go
I really have no complaints for this tablet
the buttons everything was fine and connected perfectly to my computer
I hope it was a little bit useful to you and that it introduced you to another brand
that is worth checking out
I will talk to you guys in my next video
hey guys what's going on so today
I'm gonna be taking a look at the new huion inspire a h4 30p
uh and let me tell you
I have a lot of good things to say about this thing
it was kindly provided to me by
is this nice white box containing your inspiration
a look at the back
we can see the specifications
a lot of people should be happy with this but it actually uses a micro
USB this time around so here's to the Hat
the net weight is a hundred and thirty five grams or for you
Americans out there
that's right underneath it like
I I had to take a minute
this thing is cute
okay with that tangent
I do appreciate that
they've done this because you should always download the drivers on the website
they're the most up-to-date and the most helpful
ok let's get to the real meat and potatoes of this unboxing
so the tablet comes in this nice cover which gives it a more pre
I guess I don't know it's a really nice addition but upon first impressions
I noticed that the tablet was very light lighter than I was expecting
it's a simple and clean design
nothing too fancy but at the same time it lets you know what everything does so
I like it up next
we have the pen which is going along with the theme of
oh my god this is lighter than I was expecting
it's lighter than the
Wacom pen but it's about the same with the XP pen
it has a very nice design and grip to it
it feels like a real pen which
I really do like some people might not like it because it is so light
it is lighter than the
Wacom pen as I said so
keep that in mind next
we have the micro
USB cable pretty
ok now that we have the unboxing out of the way
let's get into the drivers okay
so the huion tablet drivers they're easy to install and from what
I'm using version number fourteen point
one point 0.171 204 so if anything changes in the future
I'm not responsible
so the press keys again
it's pretty simple
you can bind it to whatever you want
you can actually do it so it runs a program which is pretty neat for a majority of osoo players
this won't really be important to you next
Oh sue the first thing you're gonna want to do is disable Windows Inc which is enabled by default
I think you also have a pressure test again
this is mainly gonna be useful for the artists out there
it's fairly simple easy to use
I didn't have any problems with it one thing I will note though is every time you change this
it doesn't change instantly
you do need to push the apply button
but that's pretty much to be expected okay
now that we have the drivers out of the way
let's get into the fun business
let's get into game play now onto my impressions
I guess it's a good tablet
I like it
I'm 93 K and when I started using the tablet
I think it 116 K so I've had no problem advancing at all
I've gotten I think ten hundred PP plays with this tablet so for the average player
you really won't have any problems with this
the drivers were extremely easy to set up
transferring my play area from my
Wakeham 480 to this was almost seamless
I was actually really surprised
it only took me about 30 minutes to adjust to this tablet
so that's really nice
some people might not like it because it is as light as it is so
I just I kind of like this pen a bit more when playing
I haven't noticed really any input like I mean
you won't have any problem with this
I really don't have many gripes with this tablet at all
it's no see th480
there was going from the 480 to this
I really can't recommend this enough as a first tablet
this is a no su players dream now once you get to the higher levels
I don't really know if I can recommend it
just because you're more likely than not gonna want to go with a 480 but for a majority of people
this tablet will be perfect for them
I don't know about more experienced players but the average player
I reviewed it was a lot of fun and I do plan on using this tablet quite a bit more
so take advantage of it while you can
I'd also like to thank each one of my patrons for kindly supporting the channel
daddy ooh woo a Rex on Jack
Rhine cinema look hanker code named Alex
Bub's new face and larceny
just a heads up to my patrons and any future patrons
we're having movie night this Sunday
we're watching the macGruber movie but yeah thanks for watching guys
this was a lot of fun to make
I hope you enjoyed the video
I'm a bad
Oh sue player
with the power of a gaming laptop of the compact design of a tablet the
Razer edge is an ambitious product
the 10.1 inch display
the OS comes free of any bloatware and the only pre-installed app is razors game launcher
anyway the edge comes in a few configurations
SSD is sure to fill up fast
it maintained a steady 30 frames per second
of course the game had to be scaled down to low settings but even at its lowest configuration
Crysis 3 still looks incredible for less demanding titles like Tomb Raider
the settings can be cranked up too high without dipping below 30fps
I tested the edge with battlefield
3 Far Cry 3 XCOM and countless others with great results
naturally gaming has a significant impact on battery life
for general tablet use the edge gets roughly 5 to 6 hours per charge
but it's an ergonomic nightmare
it has a critical impact on speed and precision in shooters and action titles
I always had to have edge and gamepad propped up on my lap
with time and iteration
it could be great but it's not quite there yet
are they worth your money
I'm gonna review the home 10.1
inch tablet next
this is straight
Android tablets aren't really setting the world on fire these days
inch tablets running an almost completely stock version of Android 9pi
first it's important to keep something in mind throughout this review
these tablets are inexpensive
the 8 inch on tablet costs a measly sixty-four dollars and this 10.1 inch version costs $79
so if you're expecting the usual review or we talk about premium specs and amazing performance
let's just say this
isn't that review
inch tablet most definitely does this device has a 10.1 inch IPS
I'm used to in premium glass
they sound more like the speakers you find in greeting cards
it's hard to write that
SD card slot for expandable
which would essentially allow for apps to be installed onto the card
and that'll help
some advice also has a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core MediaTek MT 8163 processor with 2 gigs of ram
and let me tell you that little combo right
but you won't want to why not
I'm not even sure what a camera this bad is
good for
it should have been left off
which would have actually lowered the tablet price
even more in my opinion same could be said for the 0.3
megapixel sorry VGA quality front-facing camera essentially
it's a potato from the 1990s
and really there's no reason to spend any more time here talking about the cameras
they are that bad
which actually bypasses your ear drum
only that's hot aftershocks
calm news code hot
but you aren't buying this tablet for photos anyway right
you want to browse the web
you might want to play some games
maybe read an e-book or watch a movie this is what this tablet is really designed for
I think so
Nasir and their to be expected I would say doing the verge
test is always a great way to see
just how laggy things can be on lower-end devices and I mean it didn't totally fail
things aren't as snappy as I'm used to in my pixel but it wasn't god-awful either
switching between chrome tabs takes a second or two but it does manage
it's not really the end of the world now as for games
no doubt your candy
crush is gonna be fine one of my all-time favorite mobile games
Sky Force reloaded ran surprisingly well on this
I had a hard time stopping and playing
which is my kids
current obsession is not as good
it's pretty jittery at times
very jerky which is a bummer because I had hoped this tablet would be a good low-cost kids device
and maybe it would be depending on your kid
which is fine
it's passable though again that Battery depletes so quickly
this isn't the ideal take it to the beach and read a novel device now as for watching content my
Vudu library was easy to browse and view
hey it's a movie on a 10-inch device and that on account for something now that navbar tweak that
I mentioned earlier the Walmart button
that's basically the only major change that has been made to the otherwise completely stock
Android Pi installation on this device
which is pretty awesome if anything stands out on me on 10.1 inch when compared to its
Amazon rival the Fire HD 8 and 10 inch tablets
it's that you get stock
but my guess is
don't go expecting much
and those words right
there might best sum up my time with the on
10.1 inch tablet as long as you understand what you're getting
maybe you won't be disappointed but really don't expect much yes it runs vanilla
Android yes it technically does tablet II things and yes
it's pretty darn inexpensive dare
it's only just enough technology to get by and even there it kind of falls short

hello everyone in today's video
i'm going to review the gaomon
m106k pro drawing tablet
this is a review unit
that garmon has sent over now
the link is in the video description below
so this is a pen tablet drawing tablet
that doesn't have a display
i have actually reviewed the previous model before the non-pro the m106k non-pro now
the pen no longer uses any battery
the price at the time of this review is under u.s 60 dollars all right
let's take a look at the things that i included first here
we have the thank you card warranty card
quick start guide menu and a card with links to where you can download the driver usb data cable
eight replacement nibs are included
and that's the nip remover
two adapters to help you
connect the tablet to your android phone or tablets
it's comfortable to hold with the large rubber grip
there it's removable
no port at the back because this pen no longer requires any battery to work
so this is the tablet
the design is very simple
it's a very typical drawing tablet design
it's quite thin
this is the side profile
the top and bottom are curved but the sides here they are angular there are 12 physical shortcut
buttons on the side feedback is quite firm and when you press the button
there are 16 soft keys
that you can also customize you can assess them with the pen
this drawing area is 10 by 6 which is considered a medium size
there's this little sleeve for holding the pen
and now let's see what the driver can do
okay this is where you can customize the 12 physical shortcut buttons and the 16
soft keys you can assign specific keyboard shortcuts
you want by typing the keys
these are the various mouse functions
and this is where you can change the rotation the orientation of the tablet
if you are a left-hander let's do some quick line quality test the app that i'm using here
this is midi bank paint pro
this is this is very good performance
it's um it's great
it's very accurate and predictable
they work really well personally
it's very satisfactory
you can expect the same drawing performance with the drawing apps on mac os as well
this is krita on windows
let's do the test again
this time with the samsung tablet in vertical mode
let me find out
where's the cursor right
okay i can see
there is another issue here so this time around
so you won't be able to change
i was able to map this vertical area here to the vertical format of the phone
it's excellent with the very strong software
i have tested on both mac and windows so for the price of less than u.s 16
which is the price i was able to find on aliexpress with free shipping to selected countries
it's really worth the money
it's a very good buy
thanks for watching
if you guys have any questions let me know in comment section below
see you in the next video bye
hey Teddy K here for Best Buy plugin and in this video review
we're going to take a look at the Insignia flex 11.6 inch two and one convertible windows tablet
this is a two-in-one convertible in the first place
I got it took a little time to get used to it but once I got the handle of it I liked it
of course being a two-in-one convertible means that you can separate the two
so the tablet can become a standalone tablet away from the keyboard if you so want now
it won't work right
because the latches are on the sides the magnetic latches that keep it in place or on the side
there's got the the pin connector in the middle
that's basically what you need and closing it up is pretty straightforward too
so if you want to carry it around or you want to close it up put it to sleep
HOME key the
the desktop looks a little different than it does in what we would consider desktop mode now
I want to get into battery life a little bit here
because this is a critical factor
you're gonna have to pump that up a little bit now notice when
I do that so if I go to a higher number
I'm going to show you in a second here
what happens so now as the unit is made the adjustments so
I've gone to 100% and now I'm down to 4 hours right
you don't have to be 100% that's pretty high
that's this wide again
ok so together here we have the 2 flex devices
now why are we bringing these together so what
I like the screen resolution
obviously it's 1080p on the 11 inch its 720p on the 8 inch and so not only
do you have the extra screen real estate but you got the keyboard and you also have
I would say an easier
time running certain apps on the 8 on the 11 inch
the keyboard is a big big difference between these two but I would argue that
the screen is the battery
life is going to be better overall on the 11 inch as well whereas the 8 inch does have some issues
I found the Wi-Fi connection
be better on the 11 inch as well but here there you have it
those are the two of them together and that is the Insignia 11.6 inch flex tablet for Best
Buy plugin
I'm Teddy K
thanks for watching
in this video we're gonna look at the van
Keogh matrix pad z10 10.1 inch Android tablet
I just want to give a big shout-out to van Keogh
they sent me this as a review unit and
I'm really excited to get this thing opened now
let's go ahead and take a look at the box
it actually has a really nice sleek design
it's just an image of the tablet and then on the back of the box
so let's go ahead and crack this
open all right so right away in the box
we've got the tablet front and center
the tablet actually looks really nice
this is a third-party tablet
so that's nice that they've included it and we can go ahead and peel
the protective layer off
we actually have an aluminum shell which covers most of the back and then along the two sides
we actually have plastic encasing there and I'm assuming the reason that they've done
we've got a 13 megapixel rear camera and a 5 megapixel front camera
this device comes with 32 gigs onboard
but it does have expandable memory up to 128 gigabytes with a micro
SD card
so you'll have more than sufficient potential for memory if you need it
it's not the thinnest tablet
I've ever seen but I've definitely seen much thicker
we have our volume rocker
we have our micro
USB charging port we have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
we've got our micro
SD card slot
we also have a mini
HDMI out and we have our microphone
in terms of what's on the back of the tablet we just have our van
Keogh logo with the basic information
we've got our rear camera
we've also got a really small reset button
I had with it
I found that the display is actually really really nice
US dollars which is actually a really good price
you actually have two cool features
one of them is called
which is actually really nice
the interface is really slick and it runs really well on this device with all the specs
Play Store so there isn't any limitations
I've heard some people say that you can't download netflix or things like that now
so that's really cool too in terms of performance regular web browsing
YouTube videos
things like that
they all came down
everything worked flawlessly and everything rendered nicely
but what we want to do on this channel is we want to max this out
we want to see how well this thing can perform with basic emulation
so we're gonna go ahead and download that and we're gonna see how well it runs on
this tablet generally speaking
I'm actually really impressed to know
I should mention that
I just don't like - that being said I was really impressed with the performance
which got me thinking
I think we might actually be able to get Dreamcast
let's go ahead and load up retroarch and see how this thing handles basic emulation for
no input delay
we're gonna load another game
I think we'd be okay
I might get a lot of hate for saying that
I just really have a thing for this Rayman game not sure what it is
maybe it's just some crazy nostalgia
I have towards it
it was my first platforming game on the ps1 so
I'm really happy with that
let's go ahead and take a look at another game the next game that we're gonna take a look at is
Crash Bandicoot which is a staple
let's go ahead and see how this runs now that we've got this game running for a little bit
we can see that it also plays really well
I'm not having any latency issues
the quality on screen is good
we don't have any graphical errors and there's definitely no slowdown or lag
so definitely really good
it's totally capable of playing your favorite PlayStation 1 games
now let's move on to n64 for this we're going to be using the mutant 64
and in terms of button mapping it's all up to you on how you want to do it
we're gonna go ahead and take a look at another game in this case
I didn't have any graphical errors
I didn't have any audio issues
it just ran really well so that's a really good thing to and then finally
I finished us off with some super mario 64 just to see how it runs now
this is something that most devices can play or at least they can play fairly well
this actually ran really really well and I honestly felt like I was playing it on the actual n64
there wasn't any graphical issues
there wasn't any hiccups
I just enjoyed the gameplay
now we're gonna turn the notch up just a little bit and what we're gonna try to do is get some
Dreamcast running on this thing so the app I used for
dreamcast is the redream
Dreamcast emulator and this is what I found to be the absolute best
I did try to run
Dreamcast through retroarch and it was an absolute failure
it just would not run properly crazy glitching it was very slow there was really bad
FPS drops so I ended up installing the standalone and it runs so much better now
don't think that it's perfect because are some slowdowns that
it ran really really well very smoothly and it didn't have any hiccups
the game felt really good
the next thing
it was totally playable and there wasn't any major issues
there was the occasional slowdown from time to time
but it really wasn't that big of a deal and then finally
I finished us off with some Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and that game absolutely ran perfectly
I decided to try to run some PSP games on it and I do gotta say it was completely hit or miss
it ran actually fairly well and it was completely playable
so it's kind of hit or miss
I have Dragon Ball Z
shin boudic ion here and the game ran really well
there wasn't any framerate drops and it was just really playable and then to finish us off
I did test out Kingdom Hearts and it was hit or miss
it's not the most ideal playing scenario
I've got for you for this video again
I just want to thank Van
Keogh for sending out this review unit
I really appreciate it and thank you guys for watching the video
I'll talk to you guys again real soon
hey what's going on guys this
ETA prime pack here again today
we're gonna be taking a look at the all new
Amazon Fire HD 8 plus now
the standard version does come in a little cheaper
it's $89.99 for the plus
Edition with three
gigs of ram and built-in wireless charging base price is 109 99 and inside of the box
hey I heard you guys like bezels
so here it is
I'm going to go ahead and boot it up for the first time now
I do want to mention that this is not as powerful as the 2019 Fire HD 10
CPU and a much more powerful GPU
so if you don't mind spending a little extra cash
I would definitely recommend the Fire
they've kept the headphone jack
we now have
CPU this is a MediaTek 81-68 the GPU is the Mallee g52 mc1 we have three gigs
our RAM the Plus version and two gigs of RAM
tablets aren't gonna win any awards but they will get you by
this is an 8 inch 1280 by 800 IPS display and for the price
it's a pretty decent display
we do get dual band
AC Wi-Fi so we can pick up at that 5 gigahertz network bluetooth
5.0 it's running fire
there's just not a lot so what
I did was install Google Play using my old tutorial for the 2019 fire 8 and it works fine
I got a lot of stuff installed here so this tablet is perfect for viewing Netflix Disney
Plus Hulu Amazon Prime
I mean if you want to get one of these for the kids so they can watch their Netflix on the road
it's gonna work just fine now
Plus it's compatible with the tablet
Netflix Hulu Amazon Prime YouTube
you can use
so first up we have 3d mark
we got 242
so we do have a significantly more powerful
GPU in the bigger tablet stop
we have antutu total score 90 1649
unfortunately this does not run on the older HD 8
I could never get it to work but I was able to get it to work on the fire
10 HD total score on that 126,000 632 and our GPU was around 30000
so with that out of the way let's go ahead and test some native android games
and then we'll move right into some emulation with the new fire eight
HD alright so first up we have pub G mobile now this is a very well optimized game
I was actually able to run this on the Fire HD 7 and it ran pretty decently but right here
we're getting a good framerate
this is fully playable on the new
Fire HD 8 plus and
I'm pretty sure it would run just as well on the standard version next on the list we have
I'm using the beta version here from the Google Play Store so I have the FPS on screen
I'm getting an average of around 30 FPS with 8 chunks
I still have fancy graphics on
FPS is just fine for a mobile device
so yes these tablets will handle
I'm upscaled here to 800 by 600
definitely not the best that I've seen but for a budget tablet handling n64 quite well
I got a few more games to test here
so we were able to upscale
this performance is great where you got a constant 60fps
we can do that from the menu and now we got a constant 60 unfortunately
we have dreamcast using re drain
and that's really the only game that gave me issues out of the 10 games
I've tested so far
so in the end with the new 2020
and they go on sale all the time for around 99 bucks so personally
I would pick that up when it's on sale over the new plus version of the 8
but either way you look at it
the choice is up to you
but in my opinion it's totally worth it especially with that extra gig of ram
but that's it for this video really appreciate you watching
I'll leave some links in the description in case you want to pick up any of the tablets
I mentioned in this video
thanks for watching you
hello everyone welcome back to my youtube channel

the tablet definitely gets a 10 out of 10.
i i i can't express enough
how awesome it is definitely check out the link in my video description

sometimes it's a hundred and eighty dollars
i've seen it at two hundred dollars
i've seen it at one hundred dollars honestly at all those price points
it's a great tablet
it's worth it
um but if you guys are really strong penny pinchers then wait for around holidays
valentine's day normally around fourth of july
Kobo tablet obviously saw that I mentioned their products in one of their videos
and they've actually sent me one here to have a look at so
I'm just going to do something a bit different today and just to have a look at the Kobo tablet
and if you have already done so hit subscribe now where you can stay in the loop for content
alright so this is the Kobo tablet as you receive it inside the box under the cover
you find a nice little letter with discount for next time
you shop on their store which is nice as well as some instructions
so there you go
basically they've just got them on these sheets now
obviously when you buy it it has all those on there
I've just pulled some out for the demo phrase that I've done here
they just come like this
some of these letters had actually already moved around in transit
just because of how it was packaged
but that's not an issue of the Coburn tablet
Kobo tablet does not come with numbers or symbols so this Kobo tablet
I can only be used
you know if you just use the default tiles that come with it for just standard bit 39 past phrases
the letters aren't just printed on there but they are actually engraved and stamped on each one
I've used in the past when I keep key videos
we'd basically just pop out the letters we need and stick them in there
just based off the first four letters all right so once
were stripping the thread on these
who just need to make sure you turn the screw backwards a bit until it finds the thread
you'll hear it
click and feel it
I'm doing this this and that but just for the purposes of this demo
I'm not going to worry about that once
Lots sort of extreme tests
I think that his extreme tests actually go way
I love with this one is it includes everything in the box that you need to put it in and again
that's why I'm the review page
little screwdriver does so
it's actually one impressed with the
Kobo tablet and given that you could basically buy three of these for the price of one
original crypto steel cassette
I think these are a great deal even comparing it to the crypto steal capsule or which
I'm a huge fan
you can still buy two of these for the price of one of these
just to help make sure that a single event isn't gonna wipe out your crypto
I think this is a really good value buy
thanks for watching
I hope that was helpful
hit like if you think that other people would find this video useful and hit
subscribe if you'd like to be kept in the loop about future content
I make that helps people
stay safe in the crypto space and to recover if they get into trouble
hello everyone welcome to my channel
my name is
Jax and today we'll be unboxing and reviewing the huion
H 640 p graphics drawing tablet
I get asked questions about buying tablets on a budget
they all seem to say
I've never been able to test
its claim out myself since
I've never used their tablets until of course today
so here we have the brand-new tablet right out of the post
ready to be unboxed
let's get to the unboxing
okay so here
we have a little thank-you card which is quite lovely but the little logo thank you for choosing
QE on okay
that's awesome a little bats up there
put that to the side and we'll be using that later at the CD
Oh what
we can download the relevant drivers for the tablet
now here is the tablet itself
can't just take it out the little slip here and first things first
they did remark on how actually quite small it is and yeah
it's a lot smaller than ours
I was collecting
I have a little
I can do a little size comparison as well
so this is of course a key on tablet and then here we have my Wacom Intuos art
so it's about almost
I would say half the size of the Wacom arch so just first impressions
we have the little
it's nice black material
okay what else do we have
oh there is the stylist since
I've never actually had to do so
finally we have a connection cord
we have a little instruction guide that go through all the basics
oh it looks like over here that the holder actually has ten dips in it
oh it has pen nibs no way look at all the nibs so many noobs okay
that's that's quite impressive
that's a boy but everything seems to be pretty self-explanatory
I'm just gonna go ahead
connect this to my computer and download drivers and then we can take it for a spin okay
so we're going to take the tablet for a bit of a test run now
I'm gonna install it now and I'll be back with the settings
so here's what the settings and options will now look like when everything has been installed
it's pretty standard here
I was using in many bang
it's always the thing that's recommended whenever you're it installing and you tell it but
I think that I always forget or I just don't really want to like
I can't be bothered and you know I figure it's fine
the new tablet
you can figure it out
it worked fine but then it never does and it's because
I never removed her old drivers so once I did that
I wanted to get into the drawing so here
I'll just be drawing this exact same character of mine
no particular reason
he's just a nice easy
you know it's a science experiment now for the rest of this video
I'll kind of jump in and out of time lapse at the beginning
the tablet works pretty much
how it should have worked initially
I digress
that being said using this tiny tablet with a giant screen
I could definitely feel a loss of accuracy in my brushstrokes
coloring in the base of the character within their lines was actually a little difficult
it was a bit hard gauging
exactly where the brushstroke was going to go and I could imagine that
perhaps this wouldn't be the best suited to someone looking for making final line art again
so here we are
if you're listening to just review agree a degree of customizations for things like pen
all of those worked perfectly fine
I didn't have any glitches with those
you can definitely see the different levels of pressure sensitivity
I would say the calibration definitely caters to people with lighter grips
you're using by the time
I did end up using two of the expressed keys which were set by I devote to zoom in and zoom out
which for some reason my mouse just didn't want to do so
having that was a nice bonus a couple of things
I wanted to mention was that
the stylus doesn't need to be recharged or anything
which is a huge advantage and one less thing to worry about the excess of nibs
the tablet comes with inside the pen
holder is also pretty cool and actually really really enjoyed using the pen
drawing tablet it would slide super seamlessly into a handbag or a pocket of a backpack
they can barely fit anything onto well
it will be perfect because this tablet hardly takes up any desk space
you can have it there and from your laptop with enough room for your coffee and muffins
I will recommend saving up bit more money to buy something a little bigger
if you're interested again this is the huion h6 for 0
its grateful undergo work though
probably not the best for you know
dedicated work work overall
I would give it a B so you know go check it out in the meantime my name is Jax
thank you so much for watching this video

hi this is
Brad Linder with Laputa
but unlike a lot of tablets
in this class it's available with a wide range of options including up to a core i5
there's also an micro
there's an 8 megapixel rear camera and a 2 megapixel front-facing camera and another thing
this particular model has a 32 watt hour battery
I believe select models are available with up to this backing up to 37 watt hour battery
it's it's pretty good
it's got an Intel Atom 3 7 7 0 quad-core processor
it's one of the fastest bay trail systems that
Netflix works
that we're playing here
work pretty nicely on that full HD display
let's go ahead and close that now
is you can run full desktop applications
so here we've got
applications is go ahead and pull out a notebook accessory so this is the mobile keyboard
dock sells for about 160 dollars
it's not particularly cheap
but it gives you a full size
I said you can get maybe up to 13 or 14 hours battery life depending on usage
when you use the two together officially it gives you about 50 percent battery boost
so when you put these two together whole thing weighs maybe a little over three pounds
the tablet it's about 1.6 pounds
the keyboards about 1.7 pounds and together
it's it's like a thin enlight notebook with a full
HD display in terms of overall performance
it's as I mentioned faster most Intel Atom based systems and faster than other bait rails tablets
I've tested in terms of transcoding video audio creating the zip archive files and so forth
you can find some more detailed benchmark breakdowns
at little feuding com we can watch videos in Full HD and it works just fine
I haven't had problems running
let's go ahead and turn the volume down here
I haven't had problems running multiple out side by side
it's not necessarily as fast as something with saya
Haswell CPU but in terms of benchmarks
it's surprisingly close
you know it's not that much slower when it comes to doing
CPU intensive tasks like using handbrake to encode videos
my internet connection is being a little bit on the sluggish side here so
I'm having a hard time getting video to play
let's go ahead and let that run in the background
I'll show you you know
scrolling works okay
I guess we don't have pinch-to-zoom in Firefox here an ad for a competing site
I kid I'm a fan of Android Central there we go so we've got full
when you're running certain apps like image open source image editing software which is loading
now you'll see that
lets get an open a picture that we can edit
you know it looks good there we can go ahead and zoom into 200%
so it's full screen we can use menus
it looks pretty good
so let's see what that happens
what happens when we do that in real time here
just click the apply button and now you can fit more on the screen in fact
side-by-side looks pretty good in terms of how much you can fit on the screen again
slow internet connections not making this ideal
let's go ahead and do this
that's a device that doesn't have all the perks
this is Lisa from mobile tech review
make these kind of things
but they'll actually does too clearly
any number of things
it could actually be interesting
look at it now so clearly
this thing is very beefy
it's 11.6 inch tablets
I'll call it 12 inches
it's got a quad core
CPU inside unless you go with the core i3 which is a dual core these are ultrabook
CPUs you've got two removable batteries on the back
swap them out in the field
that's pretty darn nice
a thousand in that's what
Intel claims display
we'll talk about how well it actually does there
so it's meant for outdoor use
you can still see it
it's matte and even has a polarizer so yeah that's pretty interesting stuff
of course you might want a keyboard so enter this incredibly rugged
look at this thing
you can actually probably hurt somebody with this
if you have to do
self-defense yourself
this thing is pretty darn heavy
the tablet itself weighs about three pounds
you put it together
it's not the lightest thing
shock vibration is its ip65 rated for water and for dust so that means splashing water
that sort of thing is fine now
it's submerging it in water and going swimming
that's why we're still an eighth trend because we don't have
V Pro for tenth gen yet
gigs of ddr3 low-power RAM and it has an m2 nvme
SSD anywhere from 128 gigs
so that's a bit more modern than you might have guessed from
the cpu chipset
onboard performance is just fine
though you know honestly the jump between 8th and 10th gen
ice-like isn't so super huge
the display is full
HD resolution and an 11 point 6 inches
that's perfectly fine
this is not for photoshop jockeys obviously this is a very specialized counter product
it has an anti-glare surface
it looks kind of grainy
we've measured 887
this which is still really darn crazy
bright and again it has a polarizer on the screen
it has the weirdest white balance
graph is off the charts bad
but when you look at it it actually doesn't look that way
I think it's a function of the display being driven as such high brightness
so the display on this supports touch
it is a tablet after all and also a pen now
do diagramming all that sort of thing
that's what that's for again
not a fine art product obviously like a lot of business products in vertical market products
this feels like a regular laptop keyboard
not like you're making any compromises with some flimsy tablet
II kind of keyboard
the one drawback is the trackpad
you can get a charger
that's either barrel pin or USB see
that's your choice
45 watt
optionally if you want a 90 watt charger
you can just put one and if you want you can put both in
HD resolution power consumption is not too high
you can impact battery life pretty strongly
so if you're using an outdoor is bringing a couple of spare batteries by using it indoors
I have to say that this thing has been going for like 14 hours straight
you can actually open this up to service it and you've got the m2 which is a socketed
SSD if you wish to do upgrades on it
it makes it for mobile tech review
hi everyone this is to offer on pocket blocks calm
Rhian has sent me another tablet to check out so today
I'll be showing you
they make a lot of tablets of different sizes different features now today
I'm going to show you the qe7 key take a look at what's included inside a box list by the way
I've already taken out the tablet
so there's a thank you
Scott and in this box has the stylus pen
this has a pen stand and this box as the cables already taken then out so
I'm going to show them to you one by one
this is the tablet
it's a very large tablet
it measures around 11 inches wide and 7 inches in height
so that's the working circuit error
so this is a very large tablet
the big quality is alright it has very little flex
the buttons are all right
we're good spacing apart
they are easy to press
each button comes with some indentation
let me show you what on this side here
that is the pot for the power cable
this is the on/off switch and on the other side there
is this lock toggle
switch which will lock your physical shortcut button if you want to
these are the two cables that are provided
this is the USB charging cable
this is an l-shaped connector that goes right here and this is the charging cable for the stylist
let me show you the stylist
this is how the stylist look like
it's mostly made of hard plastic
the grip section is also hot plastic
the surface finishing is met feels quite good in hand
it's lightweight but not too light
there are two shot
cut buttons here and right at the back that gives little hope for charging the tent
I'm not too sure of their battery life
let's take a closer look at it
so that's the knit
it retracts a bit into the stylus
it's right here so you can just put dollars like this
took it at an angle
you can just pull up
Nick very easily
we just put this back in all right now
is the time for me to test the tablet
let me switch this on first
I've already installed the driver software
Cisco shortcut buttons
I'm not sure why you want to do that though
now this is the dollars
that's the pressure curve
and there's no way for me to actually drag on the curve itself now
the default setting works just fine
the stylus has 8192 levels of pressure
sensitivity personally are not able to differentiate between 4,000 and 8,000 levels of pressure
let me go on to this tab here so here you can map a specific area on the tablet to your screen
there's no left hand or right handed mode you have to rotate the tablet here
the tablet cannot be used when you are charging the battery
it's still able to detect the stylus but the stylus cannot move
so that's the problem
it can be an issue if you're working on some project and then the battery runs out
let's start using the apps
this is photoshop cs5 on the Mac and right now
you can only know that if you compare them side-by-side but here
I think it works
well enough for me let me show you the transition between thin and thick
this is quite good lines of versus
it's a brush now in order to get the pressure sensitivity to work
that's not going to be any problem
I just want to demonstrate
that pressure works here as well so
I'm just going to show you some strokes drawn with a little pressure and heavy pressure
so pressure works here
let me jump over to mischief
this is a sheath pressure
works here quite nicely too
there is no lack so this is great and right now
I'm using MIDI Bank paint
Pro this is a very nice software
that is free
it has a lot of tools and brushes that's dedicated to calming
Troy pressure looks very well
you can see here
it's like it's a bit abrupt
there's a sharp drop in the thickness but for some other strokes
it's a bit more gradual so
I guess we're doing cross hatching or hatching lines like this
this is something to take note off
I'm saying this tablet does very well the apps that I'm using right now is called affinity photo
let me jump over to try a few sketches pro now font
I have three sketches
The Strokes actually
they have their own characteristics for so when I choose this brush here and I pick this
it works fine another thing
and this is the guest now at this screen
the tablet it doesn't work because the driver hasn't loaded yet
so you actually still need
Pro it's quite smooth to work on
this is a pretty straightforward review
there are not a lot of features but that's not to say that there are no bleaches is just that
I wasn't able to reproduce them today
now the type of features that
Pro sometimes the brush they would behave a bit
strangely seeing applies to Photoshop a bit strangely but that is quite rare so earlier on
I'll show you that
I plug this into my computer
I wasn't able to draw all my lines very smoothly
so if you are having this problem maybe this is the solution
overall this is a very decent wireless tablet now the size personally for me is a bit too big
I prefer 10 by 6 inches now
that's all for today's review
so that's all thanks for watching you in the next video bye you
greetings everyone Eric
here and welcome back to another product review in this video
we're gonna be looking at this little thing
this is a another new tablet from bike
I believe what is this one at least is there a 30 or so
yeah the a 30
it is a 10 inch graphics tablet
she is quite the looker
but we're gonna go over to some footage of me unboxing this thing so
I can talk to you about some specs and stuff like that
mind my skills with this thing like in the last bike video and any video
I'm gonna do my best to try and show you what this thing can do
let's get to that alright so right off the bat
I really like the box design
it's very sleek
it's very clean
it just looks really nice
it looks professional
looks like something you would get at a store which is really really nice on the back here
let's get her open
there we go right off the bat
link is right there and now let's pull her on out of here she's little snug
they did form fit this thing pretty well but I do like that
it's wrapped in some very good protective materials
I think more these graphics tablets should have that
it's very very indeed
I have a little ninety degree on there so good job Mike next
we have the pen which is a battery list pen
so there's no battery that is required and it's in a nice little case
it's kind of like a nice little like felt or something
I don't know what the material is
but it's really nice
pull the pen out here
it looks exactly like the one from the other bike
so it's very very light
some people like that some people
don't that'll be up to you
but the buttons feel good
it feels good in the hands
it's nice and smooth so good pen
I really enjoyed it
I'm trying to get stuff out
they could probably do this a little better
it's just not very convenient trying to drop things out of there but there we go
I start getting stuff out now with that battle the way
let's look what was inside the box
so we're gonna peel this open
she is a beaut she's very shiny looking
I really like the just the overall design
it's very simple very sleek not overdone
you can see on the side here
you can barely see these things which
I'll talk about later
I like it when it's on the side and also you can see on the back
it has a nice little rubber mat pieces to help keep it stable and yeah the back looks really nice
got your product information all that stuff so yeah
let's move over to installing the drivers now
alright so now
we're gonna take a look at downloading the drivers
sorry that my in my overlays gotten in the way
that is my bad
click on your preferred one either
they allow that
that is something that they say in the guide
which is really nice
which are those little keys there on the side there
they're not that visible
I'm kind of switching over to the a basically a view where you can see my hand again
the buttons are interesting
I'm not really sure
oh that's a zoom okay
so that's this little pad thing allows you to zoom so
I can easily just kind of do that to zoom which is nice
they're hard to see the buttons
do work they just take a little getting used to
I do like the scroll thing
oh yeah so just to quickly like sketch something out
it feels nice in the hand obviously
I'm whoa I am so used to this at all
please do not judge me too harshly because god
I cannot create a circle to save my life with this thing I am not used to these types of tablets
I do not enjoy them at all
Oh God okay but I am trying to be fair here
I kind of work a little slowly here maybe I can kind of work something out yeah
it has a nice kind of feel to it
that eyes all kinds of what got a nice feel to it definitely
the material has a little bit of like actual give give to it or not
II to it
I think you'll have no problems with this
at all tablet self feels nice
it's working very well as you can see
the pen is very very light because it's a battery list and you don't need to charge or anything
being a little inconsistent
looks like there's like a very small very subtle wiggle and
I'm I'm fairly certain that that is this ruler
I really like it
I think it'll be great for anyone who's really trying to start out
I like the look of the tablet
it's really good
nice and sturdy
the material is feel smooth
I would have is these these buttons need actual like they're not actual buttons
they're just touch kind of like touch pads
I don't think you can kind of see where those are by my finger right there
you can kind of see them
they're a little like plus marks but they're really hard to see
they put like a little sticker on them
I don't know if that'll affect them or not
that would actually be perfect because then
I could see it
I can go oh
I think it's fine
I think it's really good
so thank you so much for watching this video
I know this was kind of a weird one
and kind of jumbled
I hope you enjoyed if you liked it
I also do streaming
that's what I'm using here
this is actually my stream setup
I'm using a stream
Labs OBS to record this and this is basically how I stream so I do video game streams
I'm gonna be doing more art streams soon so check me out
how's it going
everybody sketch monkey here
welcome back to a new video
this is going to be a review video because the company called
so that's what we're gonna talk about today and
I don't care about any of that what I care about can the product product that I'm using
can it actually do the job that I need it to do
that's all that
I care about I don't care about
I don't care if it's the what brand it is
I don't care to have the latest iPhone with a tripled camera or depth thing
I'm more than happy with it
so that's why I have an old iPhone 7
I used to have an iPhone 5 until Apple upgraded it until it was not
I think with a plastic thing anyway
let's jump into the video
that's you know that's that you're supposed to have in our review
I'm gonna put that in this review
so let's jump into the video
Rosie making sure that the editing is on point here what do you think Rosie
is it good enough for you you suck so
I want to show you this bad boy
three-wide why it means that it's wider
it's more of a horizontal format than the standard one
that goes have something like this and the reason
I wanted the white is because I knew I wanted to sketch cars and when you sketch cars
they tend to be more horizontal
it's not like you're sketching architecture
then you might want to have the standard one but I wanted this one
I still love it and I use it to this day but as you can see the biggest issue that I had with it
is this chord right here
the where the core goes into the tablet itself
you can see that
I said yes
send it to me
the thing is start with pen and paper if you want to start sketching stuff
you don't need any gadget like this
don't think they sell them anymore but they sell something
I don't like the new tablets because they have a different surface to them
not as slippery as this one
this is very easy to sketch on and depend flows very easily the new ones
so the tablet comes in this sturdy-looking package right here
what's inside of the package
it's in two different layers
the first the top layer is this layer
like right here
we have all the cables you have the VGA cable you have the HDMI cable
the power cable the power adapter and the stand
you also have some instruction on how to install this tablet and
I'm gonna walk you through
you actually have additional nibs for your pen
should it wear out then
you need to replace it
it's really easy to adjust to whatever angle
you're comfortable with now
installing the tablet is very very simple
you just go to the website you download the specific drivers for the model that you have
I want it to be more neutral
so that's the only change that I had to do by in all the cables and you're good to go
I also really like this little detail here that huion put on the screen
it's a warm tip
the tablet comes with five different buttons
you can see them all here
it's auto minus plus menu and of course the power button and these are the buttons
it's this one right here and compared to my old pen that I use with the wake
um it's a lot thicker and bulkier than the one
I'm used to and you can see here that Rosie also likes to chew on these pens so you can see her
she left her mark right there
thankfully it didn't destroy the pen
it still works great and now it's just a little bit more original personally
I do prefer this pen over this pen for the simple reason that this feels more natural
Photoshop is you bring up the all your brushes so you can just quickly click there
you get the brush menu and then you can quickly select what brush you want
that's covering the screen
I know how satisfying it can be to watch so here
we go enjoy once
everything was plugged in
you can watch two of my videos at the same time let me show you
what's inside of this donut
this is actually the Pakistan
so what about this sketching experience
does it work as well as more well-known tablets
can you tell the difference
one issue you will always encounter with display
tablets is the distance between the sketch surface and the nib and the line itself
this doesn't bother me personally but
I know it can be annoying for some people in the beginning
I started sketching as soon as I got the HDMI to Thunderbolt adapter
in the mail there are mainly two reasons
I haven't considered getting a display tablet to replace my into us the first reason is
I like to see the whole canvas when I'm sketching meaning
second reason is
I'm so used to a regular tablet that I never felt the need to switch
Tablas tend to get very warm after a while
especially if you have
the brightness turned all the way up
I haven't had that issue with the who beyond even after long
sketch sessions of 4 to 5 hours at a time
that's not a problem because I've always used the keyboard
in addition to whatever tablet
I'm using even if it has a bunch of buttons on the side
I never used them
I've always had my left hand on the keyboard
ready to undo whatever mistake
I just did while the right hand to do
all of the sketching the size of the tablet for me is just about right
I prefer this size over the larger tablets out there and not that I care
just click the link below in the description
so what's the verdict
can we use the hooey on canvas 22 sketch and redesign a cars in Photoshop
yes yes we can
I think it's time to introduce a new official
the sketch monkey tablet
it's still the best tablet that I've ever owned and I will never get rid of it
but for the main tablet in the office we have a new King on the throne
welcome to the family
Hui on in to us
thank you for your service
you will be called for sketch duty when needed if you're interested in the Huey on cameras
20 simply click the link in the description to learn all the details and order yours
hello guys and welcome back to the channel in this video
i just want to say that at the moment
the tablet is running on november 2nd build
also you can now format the sd card as an internal storage
there isn't much to be said
it is a lineage os
it's faster smoother and more app so compatible than the stock android 7 rom
roughly around three to five hours
i like this sort of red and round rectangle border so i created and saved this style
you can also change the clock style grid layout and of course the wallpaper
now it's not all sunshine and rainbow and i found some bugs that are here and there
they're not super annoying
the touch sensor is a little buggy sometimes it takes like three seconds to unlock
and somehow it just won't work at all so i've been using passcode to unlock the device
it's been more stable
another thing that i've not been able to do is multi-window view previously in android 7
i can use two apps side by side or i can minimize them but in lineage 17.1
i wasn't able to set it up
i kept getting a network error even though i have internet connection
but that's not really a concern for me anyway
i just thought that i should mention that
thank you for watching this video if you enjoyed it
i really appreciate that anyway
hope you all have a great day
stay safe and peace
hello guys in today's video we're gonna check out the top 5 best budget tablets in 2020
if you'd like to win one of these products make sure you watch the whole video
click the like button and comment the hidden word found in this video at number
who's a tablet lover
it has the fire
OS 7 operating system based on Android 9 and
the cameras are not the best on this one they has a 2 megapixel rear and front facing cameras
I put my hands on
it'll surely solve the price problem
and on the meantime offer a great tablet experience the more
I used it
I started liking it after using it for a couple of weeks
it's the Lenovo tab for another great tablet is the Lenovo tab 4
it has a vivid display and a comfortable design
the soft touch plastic makes this tablet very comfortable
however it's still good to watch videos and movies
the lenovo tab 4 comes with a 10.1 inch screen it also has a 2.0
I should also mention that it has amazing battery life
it felt a bit heavy compared to other tablet but it surely is easy to carry
my first impressions were great
it started to lag however it still didn't disappoint me
I think that this tablet is worth it as I started to get used to it
I realized that it actually delivers great qualities
if you're using it for multimedia
I'm sure it'll solve your problems without hesitation
I will give this tablet 4 out of 5 stars
s8 is another amazing tablet with its beautiful and simple design
it draws my attention
this one is definitely one of the most valuable tablets in the market
I enjoyed working with it
this one is for whoever enjoys a good enough tablet with a great performance and an amazing design
it has a qxga
and this depends on the model
you want you can also add up to 128 gigabytes with a micro
SD card and when it comes to the processor
it has a quad-core 64-bit intel atom z3580 processor
I didn't notice any lags as I was playing some games and changing between apps
it also has touch responsiveness of 20 milliseconds when I first took the Asus n pad s8
i used the zed stylus and did some sketching and design work
I had fun to be honest and then I started to open up tabs
I wanted to know how much this tablet can handle
it did a great job with no lags at all
I'm now using it for two months
I can say that it's one of the best because I do everything with these tablet work
I pick up the same pad
s8 want to cool my mind a bit and place in games or have some fun
I pick it up again
I think that this tablet is worth it at number two
the thing is that they didn't stop there and delivered us
great tablets to the media pad
m5 is a tablet which everybody should check out and see how good it is
it may disappoint the
Oh Jack users because this one doesn't have one
Hardware it doesn't support Netflix or 1080 the display like I said is amazing
make me spend even more time using the media pad m5 it
the only disadvantage is that it doesn't have a 3.5
millimeter jack and it feels a bit weird when you use it vertically
otherwise it's a great tablet that will help you a lot in your everyday life
I would highly recommend this tablet to the people who want an amazing display
and everyone else
who's looking for a great tablet
it's easy to use and provides great qualities and at number one it's the Samsung Galaxy Tab
a 10.1 the Tab
Samsung is one of the best to ever produce this Cayenne device
even though it isn't expensive it has many great features
it's perfect for every type of tablet user
this tablet feels and looks a lot like the tablets that are very expensive
I played some games and I can't say that I had a great time
no lags at all
it really is simple to use and feels comfortable enough
I tested it by opening up some apps and open some tabs in Google Chrome first
it didn't lag at all but I noticed some minor system lag as I continued the testing nonetheless
it did a great job and I'm very thankful to some some for making this cheap
but amazing tablet you can use it wherever you want to and thanks to the battery life
you don't have to bring your charger everywhere
you go after using it for a couple of days
I realize that it really helped me a lot even though I haven't used it for a long period of time
I'm sure that the Galaxy Tab a 10.1 is very durable and can last you a lot more than you expect
I think that this tablet is the best compared to other budget tablets in the market
I will give the Galaxy Tab
four five out of five stars no doubt it's very affordable and provides great quality
you should definitely consider the tab full if you've decided to buy a tablet thanks for watching
I hope you liked the video
LTE as you might expect at those price points
the performance is kind of weak
but it's as tablet good enough for simpler tasks and enjoyed for my next ablator
come and this is my
that was released two years ago
it is a direct competitor to the cheaper
Amazon fire
this one looks a bit nicer and feels just a bit higher end at the same time
it is thinner with apron
eight millimeters and lighter with 250 4 grams so than the Amazon fire 7
on the right side we get a power button and volume controls
and you can use microSD cards as internal storage
I've got the ite version and in this case the nano SIM slot is located at the exact same place
by the way you can use the 4G version to make phone calls and send text messages
we get one speaker which is located above the screen
the picture quality is not that good
but yeah not that great
it's a 7 inch screen with a resolution of 1024 by 1600
that sounds really bad but actually is still usable
don't get me wrong you certainly
the screen is fully laminated
the screen is noticeably better than the one from the fire
it's bright enough to use comfortably inside but even outside on a cloudy day it is a bit dark
in both cases we also get 1 gigabyte of RAM and an 8 gigabyte or 16
gigabyte internal storage
I've got the 80 version and as you can see in my benchmark
and if you want to get it
I suggest you get 60 gigabyte as well out of the box
6.8 gigabyte are used by the system
already actually that is not bad at all because tablets from Huawei and Samsung usually use more
the performance is pretty bad and it does not get better in my gaming test
simpler games like banana
I guess that happens due to the one
I was able to read
I had to wait quite often doing my review of this tablet
this is not a magic tasking device even if something is installing in the background from the
Play Store you will notice
seven is much better doing everyday use
let's get to something more positive and that is a software really
Nova types of essentialist one in android 7.0 nougat but
I don't think that there will ever be a major software update
UI is almost not customized at all and that is great
the performance is not great for multitasking
but in theory you can run two apps side by side inside the Lenovo Tab seven essentials
I'm really not sure how Lenovo is measuring that
obviously the runtime will be lower
I recommend really know what have 7 essential sadly for most
I cannot considering the price the build quality is good and the display is fine too
I also like that we almost get vanilla Android and the battery
life is great for such a cheap tablet
well let's take a look at a couple of the main competitor is the 7-inch Amazon fire
Lenovo tab for 8 with almost vanilla Android
alright that's my review of the Lenovo Tab 7 essential
if you have any questions just write me down below i'm android for my next subdued calm
thanks for watching
so you might be asking what is the
Kobo tablet why do I need it
why is it important
that's compatible
which is most of them
so what's really important about this is you might be wondering okay
well that's where the
Kobo tablet comes in
the crypto steel and the crypto tag which are very nice and very premium products
they price anywhere between $80 and 250 dollars this device here is only $39
I'm gonna do a quick unboxing here to kind of show you how that works
well actually
yeah on the back here
you can go all the way up to 20 forward phrase so actually if you have sale
it's a treasure
Model T for instance only comes with the twelve twelve word recovery C phrase
you could actually back up to wallets for the price of one on this if you really really wanted to
so if you have a little padlock or anything like that do you want to keep it secure
so that people can't go in and steal and look your recovery C phrase
I recommend this really for anyone that has over forty dollars
worth of crypto on a hardware wallet this is the backup to your backup and the paper
recovery seed wallets are nice to have but as you know paper is not indestructible and bad
things can happen if you lose it
recommend that and then if
it's very very simple
I think they have a tape
the standard comes with it comes with the 24 word phrase so that will completely cover
for the crypto steel
in the bill fall they were not as as sleek and clean as this one
the tiles will kind of have jagged edges
they were missed you know
they have different sizes so it was kind of like thrown together
obviously you need the first four letters of your recovery seed phrase and then you'll unscrew
what you'll do is you'll unscrew
where was it
oh it's right here
you'll unscrew it here and then it will slide out and I'm not gonna do it right here on this video
I'll do it on the next one
it should be
it should be closer to $100 in my opinion
you really do need this
that were lost and what had happened is is he had his recovery
see phrase in a plastic bag thought
there's nothing you could do that was Bitcoin those for Bitcoin now are gone to the ether
the battery died so the only way that he could recover
it is through the recovery
C phrase which was now unusable
backup to your entire crypto bank vault then
I don't know it is
that's exactly why
I have actually a few of these in fact I have a Kobo vault
a bill fato crypto tag
I review all of them but I actually use them as well for all of my hardware wallets
I have a metal rack of a receipt
backup for all of them
so you definitely need these
I'll go ahead and leave a link in the description below
sending me this hardware wallet
thanks for watching guys
this is Lisa from mobile tech review
and this is the Lenovo ThinkPad x1 tablet
this is the first business tablet
it wasn't everything we'd hoped it would be so take two is something
that's much more modern and very compact very portable
look at that
that's really nice reminds me of the samsung galaxy
SSDs ample amount of RAM and some interesting connection modules
we're look at it now so this is the Lenovo ThinkPad x1 tablet
Lenovo's first business tablet is quite some time running
Windows 10 and Intel Core M skylake CPUs
it's a two-part are technically really a three part affair
I asked Lenovo and they said yes indeed
the keyboard will always be in the box
you don't have to hunt the keyboard and you get the full sides
that comes with a little toothpick
stylus that fits in the silo
AES technology that's the newer Wacom technology
so you can clip it to the side of the tablet for transit
and it's it's robust
it's not going to get lost
it's actually more effective than the the surface pro
4 uses the tablet ships with a citizen
numbers unlettered their 45 watt charger
some cord a decent length of cord
not as long as your usual laptop kind of charger but you get the idea
the tablet has a 12 inch IPS display and
it's a very good display
you know lenovo often lets us down a little bit with the quality of their
ThinkPad displays this one has great characteristics
we'll talk about that in depth in a minute
it is 2160 by 1440 resolutions
as a high resolution display
the tablet by itself weighs 1.7
the usual magnesium alloy and PPS plastic
it's an injection molded plastic for the casing
it feels pretty sturdy
it doesn't flex much although if I twist it a little bit I can make the stand pop out a little bit
but that's a little abusive to be twisting something like that
lenovo says that the back can be removed to upgrade the internals
I'm sure Ranma soldered on as always at the SSD which is a SATA 3
SSD should be accessible in there now I tried
there's no service manual out to this yet and
the kickstand is released with the lever over here and it's resistant space
but you have to open up about that much before it works so for those people want to draw on it
you have to have it at that angle
you can't go down as low as this
the kickstand is stiff enough to be effective
and it doesn't really wobble a lot
I mean you really have to
that's different a lot of laptops
let's put it that way and you can go down this far
ThinkPad keyboard just twelve inches in size a little smaller than normal
it's even got backlighting
1.35 millimeters of key travel
it's very pleasant to type on albeit
it's a small layout it is twelve inches so it depends on how you do with smaller keyboards
I adjusted to it pretty quickly and I found it very pleasant to type
I'm good key damping not noisy
even though it's you know it's going to have a hollow effect against the desk like that it
there's not much echo
a little bit weird
this is going to feel normal
it does show fingerprints and this looks like leather
Pogo pin connector
and that's how it connects to the bottom of the tablet
maybe yes just like surface so you take it we do that
you get the same surface like thing and you can either use it with the keyboard flat on the desk
I didn't have much like anything to stay the Magnus hold it firmly in place there so there you go
now what could this before huh huh
we have more connectors that's because there are optional
modules here lenovo has three in the works
HDMI port USB 3.0 port
that's going to be around 150 dollars
I have HDMI port as well
we have a USB 3.1 standard port
USBC 3.1 point and on top over
here we have the fingerprint scanner
the nice modern
lay your finger on it and that works with
Kensington lock slot
you got your volume controls your headphone jack and the power button
the power button
I love to hate the power button
it sticks out a lot really relatively speaking
it's very easy to press it
it's not one of those stiff little buttons
it would turn on
we have an 8 megapixel camera
II and designed
they tend to have actually better front-facing cameras
so you look a little less noisy and grainy when you're doing Skype video chat so the display
it's mostly all good news here and Lenovo often falls behind the competition
when it comes to color gamut they usually do pretty good on brightness
this one indeed is both bright really bright 365
nits a brightness
I took it out the box and looked at the screen was oh this is nice
lenovo's done well now the bad news
well it's coated in Gorilla Glass
that part is good but this is a very very reflective display
even just shooting this video
skylake core em
this one is not going to do that
it's not ever going to get hot in my experience
warm sometimes no hot and no fans no noise
that's a good part
it's fine for even some moderate work
I add core M has come a long way in
we're just fine
OneNote note taking absolutely not a problem in this office
not a problem if you're going to be using this for Photoshop
but fast storage can mitigate that and we do have
there is the core
M 5 - 6 y 5 7
that's a 1.1 gigahertz core M turbo boost higher than this
so don't worry it doesn't spend its whole life running that slowly
that's what we have in ours
it's not bad at all really geek
computationally that means any computational tasks it's heavy like crunching big spreadsheets in
Excel that sort of thing
it's going to take a bit longer but again it's it's been fluid
it's been fast
we expect tablets to have relatively long battery life often but that's not always the case
surface pro 4 is no energizer
bunny neither is it a
Lenovo mix 700 which is the consumer version for lack of a better word of this ThinkPad
x1 tablet well
37 watt hour battery Intel Core
so keep that in mind but it's not going to be some
Wow look at this I kick the iPads but I run so long in a charged kind of product
side-by-side similar sizes similar design philosophy
just a different way of executing the kickstand
Lenovo's is essentially upside-down
now the nice part
Wacom AE s-pen branded as the ThinkPad pen
Pro works just fine
honestly you get palm rejection here though occasionally
I'll accidentally trigger something on screen
it's smooth it's fluid there are levels of pressure sensitivity
control is fine there
I switched to the pencil and you can see
I'm getting a variety of lines
my hands are not on the screen in part because well
it didn't mark up here at all
follows the pen perfectly well like that
it's keeping up
I'm not going too fast and how about jitter
I'm not the smoothest slow line line drawer in fact
I tend to draw pretty fast
I'm not seeing a whole lot of terrible jitter there
Wacom does a good job with that pressure sensitivity of course is there if I press heavy
it goes heavier now
let's see what happens when we go really fast
it's quite good for some reason
mischief usually misses the beginning of my stroke
let's say like that
it's not getting in my way at all so there you have it and lastly
I'm using the grainy dry brush right now
it's just fine palm rejection again
that's up to the hardware and not the software so that works quite well
it's decent
it's just a little unpredictable
where sometimes it can just totally fall far enough behind that
how you configure it
it's a two-piece ensemble you get the keyboard with it
yeah that's always nice from
Lenovo full-size pen
it's not quite as fast as I would like it's bearable
it's okay for a business work for note-taking it's just fine
something that's expensive is surface
pro 4 is a little bit of a hard sell
I'm Lisa from mobile tech review
what's up YouTube
Tom from tech stops here coming your way and today
we're doing a review of the blackberry
playbook this is BlackBerry's answer to all the other tablets out there
it comes in seven-inch with an s 7 inch LCD screen with three different variants
I did do an unboxing on this product
you may have seen the video if you have it in the description box
it looks really nice in hand
7 inch screen
it doesn't look too
it doesn't look too small
it is quite a bit smaller than the 9.7 inch ipad 2 but for the PlayBook it does really feel nice
feels like it's made of high quality construction and materials
so if you drop it
it doesn't feel flimsy
it doesn't feel like it's got a break
it does have two cameras front facing and a rear facing camera
the front facing camera is a 3 megapixel camera and rear facing is a 5 megapixel camera
you've got the speaker and the speaker itself is actually a very high quality speaker
you don't have to use it a full blast like other
what's out there
the problem with other tablets are the speakers they have is
they're actually on the sides or behind on the rear of tablet
you've got a hdmi port
which can stream full 1080p
and as you can see some of these videos especially if you hold one of these for yourself
it's a super vibrant screen
it's really nice and crisp
so it's not the problem at all
other tablets
out there that are seven inches or smaller actually have mobile phone software
it's very streamlined
the multitasking and the gestures work really well
that's touch sensitive
I really enjoy respect to the browser
it's very smooth and very quick
you will note that the PlayBook does support flash which is a huge teeth
well incorporate it in the browser one thing to note with the OS
there's no native email or client or contact applications which is a little bit frustrating
you can connect to a blackberry phone
totally that will be the case and
I'll really fix up this
this sort of beholder
at this stage the 16 gigabyte version retails for 580 not eighty dollars
there a little bit cheaper and you push them from all large electronic
i do prefer the slightly larger
iPad 2 size but seven inches
i'll be happy with that and it does give you a little bit more
Portability and in taken around a little bit easier than the ipad 2
it's really crisp
aren't that many negatives with it
I definitely consider you guys checking them out
it's very very good
so it's a blackberry
playbook review tomm from tech stops here
don't forget to follow me on twitter
twitter at tech stops
catch you guys next time
sup guys cerebro here with t3g bringing you another review this time
we're going to talk about a 10 inch off-brand visual land never heard of them figured
I'd try it out see what's going on
I wanted to know the 10 inch I wanted an Android
hey 90 bucks
why not a tiger right check it out so
I figured one out
let's do it so
I'm looking for something with a gig of ram I've had 512 before no dice not for me
sorry so found this bad 190 bucks one gig of ram
I'm down with it
4.1 jelly bean
okay sure 16 gigs
memory internal absolutely micro
SD card slot as I saw her the display
I'm with it
I'm winning perfect
that's why reading comics awesome fantastic
it's got preloaded apps
never never too happy about that but I took a look at the display
I figured you know what it's open
and we've got a 10 inch capacitive
five point multi-touch 5.0 picture so that's not that big a deal reading comics on and cool games
I'm not doing fancy stuff with 10 fingers and I you do stuff
how do you hold it you know
that's different 2160p high-definition playback
continuous asterisk asterisk asterisk
and yeah so the next thing is will we toss them actually the one thing
I'll noted I'll note about this
this is probably the best best
pack off-brand tamanna ever touch
it's not sealed so if you're picking one up make sure this is my second one
it's got some some kind of notch ins and take a little bit of a second
let's actually unbox this
I know I don't use usually do this but like I said the best boxing ever for an awful
so we've got a large section here under the tablet pop that up
it's actually nice and padded so during shipping and transport to your home
it's protected it comes with headphones now
I haven't use these because I'm probably returning it and I'll get to that in a minute
it has a USB to micro USB converter where you can plug the flash drive press each ten
it's got the booklet for sand
and that's pretty much it for that section
not too embarrassing
we have our other compartment here
which has our sadly non-standard charger but it's cheaper
I'll say why let's touch the hardware first on the back
we've got that back the rear facing camera we have our speakers
they're decent nothing nothing to write home about
you've got your power and volume rocker up
top and yet another horizontally oriented tablet for a reader
not so great
the ports are on the side so we have
we have micro
SD card slot
we have our non-standard charger
we have our reset button
I actually didn't see that indicated anywhere besides right
there had actually gotten like this person back happen that your mini HDMI port
headphone jack
microphone and it's actually for repair
I don't expect much
it's a lower-end tablet but I still wanted to see how it works
what's on the screen
I don't know why you need to know that that's the entertainment page when you've got YouTube
I went ahead is I downloaded smart washer
I ended up getting three options
which means that
my standard four point one launcher was still on the system which
I definitely switched it
so our standard launcher is there
I mean it runs pretty decently honestly for again an off-brand tablet your four point
I can't imagine this would be poor
this is an older model and their new
Pro or prestige 10 d or G or an or Saturn something
there's a letter following
I think it's prestige tending it does have Google Play according to the website
I'm actually gonna show this on there anymore so with Google Play
I would say absolutely
this is a great deal
the let's just say Twitter so Twitter comm play and 50% done so welcome Twitter
that doesn't have its own display to use the media device so yeah overall really decent system
I like it I would say buy it honestly obviously the new one with Google Play
it comes with the one apps marketplace and get jar
I did find basically all the comic reading apps that I used on Android before
it gives you some sort of
I don't know I don't know what did what to call it
I was correct
you can remove anything that's pre-built pre-installed
I've removed both of those other plate
app stores updated to Google
Play services installed Google
I wasn't having none of it and they're really kind of solid my experience on it
I I'd rather try for something that already
has it built in so they don't have to play around that portion of it cuz
that's just me
yeah pick it up
why not especially you know
find for the 90 bucks absolutely pick it up cuz why not me
I'm probably gonna take this bag
I I want something with no
we'll play need that comfort
got a couple fun videos coming up for you guys stay tuned you
what's going on everybody
Matthew Bonas here and right in front of you have Lenovo ThinkPad x1 tablet
this is the hybrid version of the x1 carbon
it also has that mi
you're gonna get more mileage out of the x1 tablet
the hinge on the back is built into the tablet
this is very important
I never recommend a hybrid laptop that uses the case as a hinge
I find those designs to be very poor and offer a very janky experience
this hinge is very stiff
I just want to talk about the pen for one second
it uses a battery
it offers a great experience
I didn't have any latency and writing and drawing on it was great
the only problem I have with it is the way it is held against the laptop
you see you have this little connector
that goes into the side
everything is pretty much soldered on to the motherboard
but you can't swap out the m2 nvme
SSD the display on
the x1 tablet is absolutely gorgeous
it's qhd+ three thousand by two thousand resolutions
so exactly like the surface pro that means when it comes to productivity
you're gonna get a lot more mileage out of this display
compared to the x1 carbon a three by two aspect ratio is perfect for doing work-related tasks
if you're using
now the other difference is the fact that you have a webcam in the back
this is an eight megapixel camera and I was actually quite surprised how good it is now obviously
I can't say the same thing about the front-facing 2-megapixel camera
it is absolutely awful
it doesn't look good
it feels like a potato and quite frankly
I don't understand why business laptops have bad webcams
you're using this thing to videoconference with your taking this into meetings
I still want to mention
audio is pretty clean and clear with good highs and mid but the volume itself is not very
the keyboard on the x1 tablet is great for a hybrid laptop personally
I think the tight cover on
it is better than the one on the surface pro
it has the exact same layout as the x1 carbon but the travel distance is obviously less
both laptops are using
my unit is spent with the i-5 8250 you
so that means you get two more cores compared to last year
which makes it great for things that can utilize it so
let's say you're editing video
Docs maybe you're doing
Excel you're not gonna see that much of a speed difference compared to last year now
maybe you're a business professional
who likes to game a little bit
League of Legends or even overwatch on very low settings in terms of heat
the x1 tablet does a fantastic job
I 5 in here
I'd be kind of concerned but overall this laptop handles heat very well
there was no thermal throttling and even under full load
the fans kept nice and quiet now when it comes to a battery life
that's where things started looking a little bit different
the x1 carbon
I was getting some fantastic battery life
but with the x1 tablet
I was baking around five to five and a half hours of use before needing to charge now
the lenovo x1 tablet is a fantastic hybrid business
I think the x1 carbon is a better buy
let me know your thoughts on the x1 tablet in the comments below
if you enjoyed this video feel free to hit the like button
if you're new to the channel subscribe and I'll see you in the next one
hey everybody get slot inside button
we're taking a look today at the new refreshed
Amazon HD 10 tablet
this is an upgrade over the prior
Edition that runs a bit faster
all of the opinions you're about to hear are my own
so let's take a closer look now at the hardware
this is 149 dollars for the 32 gigabyte version for that price
though you're going to be getting ads on the lockscreen like this so
I've seen a bunch of different ads some from Amazon
they're trying to sell me an accurate earlier as well
the tablet cost one hundred and sixty-five dollars
with that 32 gigabyte capacity they have a 64 gig available for 189 that again is with the ads
I think it's probably just fine now
the overall look and feel of this is exactly the same as the prior Edition
it's got a nice weight to it
it is 1.1 pounds that is about 503 grams
the screen is glass
the screen as you can see here
picks up a lot of fingerprints but it looks really nice for a budget device
you've got a 10.1 inch IPS display
this is running at 1900 by 1200 which is the same that the prior
Edition was running at things are really super sharp
it's nice and bright
it looks fairly close to what you would get on the entry-level iPad which costs a lot more
so it's a really really nice display to look at and read on that very pleased with it
the one issue though of course is that this is a 16 by 9 aspect ratio
the processor inside is the big story of this one
it's got a mediatek
it does have stereo speakers
so you can't plug in a dock and get all this other stuff going with it however you can plug
so you can pop in additional storage
it'll take up to a 512 gigabyte microSD card
the camera system on here is not spectacular
you do though have two two megapixel cameras
they've improved the front camera slightly
but it's still not great so this one's now 2 megapixel
I think before it was just like the VGA resolution 640 P or something 480p
excuse me the rear camera is also a 2 megapixel shooter again
nothing spectacular out of this
the images are not great but they're adequate for taking a quick photo every once in a while
so that is the overall hardware
we're just going to browse the nasa.gov homepage here and you can see
things are springing up very very quickly on it
it supports wireless
it really feels like a more expensive device than it is so for basic things like web browsing
you should be fine
Netflix and Amazon
Prime video are also available on this
this comes up very quickly as well
I've been overall just pleased with just how snappy and responsive everything is is
Android you don't get the Google Play Store Amazon
has their own app store that they use so if you bought a an app on Google
Play that app will have to be repurchased on this now
so you can issue the a-word commands to it
we're going to mute out the a word so
there's one more mode to show you
let's check that out now if you prefer this to be an Amazon echo
show my advice would be to have
so they give you some options
they will be quite happy with what they're going to get out of this
from a performance standpoint
we also took a look at some game emulation
and this is one of the more challenging emulators on the Android platform
it's running pretty nice
they chose to put inside of it again
Amazon said this was only a 30% increase but here we are more than doubling our performance
so that was great
also at this moment cost twice as much as this tablet does and for a budget offering
you're not going to get twelve hours out of it
but it does its core tasks quite well and the performance boost here is noticeable
the display looks fantastic
I think it's probably the nicest display I've seen on a sub $200 tablet and overall
that 7-inch only comes with a 90-day warranty
this one's good for a year
so it's just a good deal and something worth considering
I just the lower-priced version will give you advertisements when you boot it up but generally
it's not all that invasive
let me know what you think down in the comments below and until next time this is
the four guys with quarters podcasts
Chris ala Greta
Tom Albrecht Brian Parker in
Cali an Kumar
yo what's up guys
welcome to the review of the houyan inspire roy h 1060 p in this video
i am going to do a quick review
I realized after finishing the video that this pen holder doesn't just hold the pin this way
I haven't covered in this video
make sure to ask them in the comments
I'll try to reply to every single one of you
okay guys one one extra thing
sorry about the background noise my mic
don't worry it all go back to focusing on my thing soon okay okay
I'm guessing all cables all
it's the pin so you got a USB
I'm guessing that's the plug that plugs into it
cool here's the pin looks nice
it's rhett and test it
let me have a look
it's got a rubber grip so you hold onto it quite nicely
it's got two buttons on the side
yeah it looks good
that's plastic not meat over
that's fine put that over there
shut that over there so
crucial spear nibs
yeah that's three it's eight nibs eight spin-ups
I think is four minus one
that's very quick math
cool it's ended better
you hold the camera focus
okay yes screw it on screw it on and you got a little pin pin holder
this is the to actual tablet
it's so thin it's really thin
it's in a bag so I guess we'll get to that last
put that over there battery
free pain tablet
I guess and this is instructions blah blah blah
we might need that
it doesn't look like it actually did come with a glove which
I was wanting a glove
but that's fine if it doesn't come with it
I'm pretty sure you can order gloves
so you pretty select five bucks or something
that's fine okay so
I guess that's just instructions for how to though I Drive a manual ears
oh you have to download the drivers online
it's called instructions so and we need that
the pen is really cooler
they really fits your hand perfectly
I'm not sure how or where cuz I've never really had one of my own drawing tablets
but here's the drawing tablet in a bag guys so here it is
I think this bit here is for the pin to like so like
hold your pen I guess or you can I call it by there
so that's quite nice
I'm pretty sure though
they called them sore
that code but there is 16 of those so it looks very cool
it feels really good so yeah it looks cool feels good
I guess I could try to plug it
I'll try to plug it in
i think actually hold up a sec guys
oh there's the plug on the side there to plug it you've got like a meter cable
I would say I'd say it's a meter cable long enough
I think to plug it in
it's also got these little rubber bits on the back
I don't know if that's focusing on
I can't tell rub a bit on the back
four of them which makes it sit nicely on the disk and this cable just goes up
you shouldn't that shouldn't bother you
the cable coming out the side good
I think I just need to download the drivers as definitely unless they like
tractors offer hell or car crash
anything like that then that would get broken but apart from that
I had wrapping all around it
so you guys if you're either ever getting a package from
Hui on or anything like that
I think it's done
well it's turning on so it basically shows this
I can't fullscreen it so you guys can only see a tiny portion of it
I ever fiddle with that latex
I'm not 100% sure what hotkeys I want
so I'm guessing ctrl Z or Z
or however you want to pray on so yeah okay
so it's that one right there that button right
there is going to be used a lot for gone
basically you can change all those
there's two side buttons
I think I accidentally just Christa cause
this feels so weird
I've never done this sort of thing for
Claire's cool okay
that works fine
this is really lightly
look at that really light line
that's awesome okay that's cool
let's move over here work area
I guess and that's just meaning from each corner of the tablet goes to those corners
yup there's absolutely time so
I'm pretty sure it's everything work
and so you've got a total of 13 hotkeys that you can have
let's do it way
yeah that's true our self an eyeball
hey guys just wanted to say my overall thoughts on the tablet at the end after
I finished my drawings and everything so my overall thoughts of it is
it's really nice and comfortable to use for long periods of time
I sat there for about
I would say six hours straight drawing some pictures and I didn't feel any pains or anything
it's really comfortable so I definitely recommend it to you guys
I feel looking for a mid-range tablet to buy
I definitely recommend it by the way guys
I'll be streaming on Twitch
I'll see you guys next time I guess
it is one of the most powerful kids tablets out right now today
two out of its box
you'll see that
it has a pretty appealing
look to it
it is thin and fairly lightweight given its appearance
it comes with a red rubber silicone case that can be removed without its cover
the knobby is white with non-functioning red buttons in the corners
the strangest thing about the appearance is the grid of slightly protruding squares on the back
they look like they could provide some extra grip
but their main purpose is to customize the tablet with various accessories overall
I like the design
one of the most important factors especially with a higher priced product
you can't go dunk it in water but it holds up well two drops and bumps the biggest concern
I had was the screen
the 7-inch screen fills up
which is what kids will use
Nabi mode was well laid out and intuitive eight
large icons fill each screen
and if you don't want to scroll you can condense them on to one page mommy
daddy mode is password-protected
it is a bit more adult in its layout with similar icons all in one page sound quality
the internet was slow at first but after that the load time was extremely fast
let's the Nabi 2 features something called spin
let's plus TV and spin let's plus music for TV it is like Netflix for kids
same goes for the music selection
it is all kid-friendly apps games and downloads
the Navi 2 comes with a lot of demos of popular games like Angry Birds and fruit ninja
it is responsive quick
well laid out and fun to use plenty of parental control features
what's up guys averagetechguy
here and today we are back with another review this time
we're going to be looking at the 2019 version of samsung's galaxy tab a
i've turned it on
i played with this and i have to say it is a pretty decent product
that turned on you get it started up and other things that are going to come in
this is the actual tablet
so this is the samsung galaxy
tab a comes in three separate colors i have the black here notice
you just get a matte black finish on the back and you get the samsung logo
a little two-tone with your camera up here down bottom
this is a lcd screen
you don't get that nice amoled screen but the display is still nice on here
but it's going to be a good picture
you got a xno 7904a processor in here and it comes pre-loaded with android 9.0
and it has samsung one ui over that as far as camera
setups you got a five megapixel shooter
right up here
up front takes pretty decent pictures but most of the times
4.2 6 000 milliamp hour battery and as i mentioned you do have usbc charging on day
if you've never had a tablet this is going to be a great one to start out with
it's fast it's fun
it's really easy to navigate
the screen controls work really smoothly
swiping is a breeze on here
i'm just going to show you how gameplay handles on here um we'll just turn the volume down first
now you notice you still get those nice vibrant colors on here screen
looks really good
really clear really crisp
uh let's let's just do this for the fun of it as you can see
it's it's not lagging
it's solid as i'm tapping the screen
it actually does everything that it's supposed to be doing
which is a big plus
everything looks good with gaming
now i know a lot of people are going to say
hey i play um fortnite or i play pub g on my tablet
will this play those games
everything looks good when you want to get out of here
this tablet does pretty good
i have no issues out of that
it's a pretty solid tablet and for under 300 bucks
i think it's a really good buy
this is basically going to be the tablet for that person
we'll check out these resolutions so it starts out at 480.
we we can actually go up to 1080 at 60 frames per second
the person that's looking for something just to entertain them help them surf the web
be sure and give me that thumbs up
please subscribe average that guy out peace
after releasing the thinnest lightest 10 inch late last year with a tablet z now
Sony unleashes on the unsuspecting masses
another svelte boomerang
it also adds a much more powerful processor and an improved display more or less
Sony again managed to keep a tablet waterproof and with IP 58 certification in depth
so let's dive five feet deep into Sony's nest and it's late
just make sure
the protective port flaps are firmly closed
when you line the bathtub binge watching
Game of Thrones for example
we're willing to let it slide
so you won't look as squeezed in
Starbucks says when you're holding an aluminum iPad air for instance
hopefully you're not that vain
it's not right under your thumb tip so you can't press
those flaps fit very tightly and a soft flush with decided
if they weren't marked you'd be looking around for them for quite some time
the tablet will keep reminding you to close them if they left open or else
LED and uses red and green phosphor with blue LEDs and has tailored color filters on top
fir that are set to produce brighter and more evenly spread lighting
for instance
that is indeed
the case with the z2 tablet as its triluminos panel shows vivid somewhat and realistic colors
PPI pixel density given that we have high-end Samsung slates with 1600 P screens for example
still the z2 tablet 1200
P is more than enough for most purposes
the issue with the display is not the pixel density but rather its high light reflectance ratio
the mirror-like effect is constant
and especially annoying if you use the tablet outdoors despite the decent 414
it's a big flatness that we measured the IPS panel surf viewing angles are very good and overall
Sony uses its Xperia interface on top of Android 4.4
and that's about it
there isn't much difference from the previous experience and Sony's two offers
you're doing underneath
and you can fire up to five such resizable windows
which is a decent way to multitask on the tablet if needed
Sony's new catwalk model is powered by a fast 2.3 gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon 801
it's the slower
needless to say it improved processing power results in a fluid browser performance
there are no hiccups while panning around scrolling or zooming in and out
Sony uses the stock Chrome browser that comes with Android now so if you want
Adobe Flash support you'd have to look for third parties options
there are two versions of the tablet based on the connectivity options
and the ona
the tablet sports this infrared sensor at the top managed by dedicated apps
Sony uses its album app in place of a stock gallery and offers plenty of picture
editing modes that can be used from within the apps interface
there's this interesting track edit
overlays out there
that only happens when the talat is paired with
you'd expect from
the tablet shoots in a wide 16 by 9 aspect ratio
which is about 5 megapixels
back background blur effect
when shooting close objects
the pictures come out with a vivid color representation
that is a tad oversaturated
compared to reality yet still very pleasant to look at the camera captures plenty of detail in
but that's large expected with such camera indoors
we get smooth 30 frames per second 1080p
recording from the z2 tablet's camera
some recorded with the video is strong and clean
Sora's Xperia z2 tablet is a great improvement over its record-setting predecessor
it is even thinner with a much faster chipset and a better display also
it has an excellent sound output
the slimmer slide is 10-inch tablet on the fly
there are only a few issues with the z2 tablet chief
among which is the high screen reflectivity
which makes it a nuisance to use
outdoors the pixel density also leaves something to be desired
the jet pro has a high-resolution display and a new magazine
UX with an excellent split-screen multitasking mode for the interface
it is less compact in the z2 tablet however and isn't waterproof
I'll test the best 10 inch and wit slate
there are a lot of drawing tablets out there but which one is right for you
thanks for joining me today
so we may not see another version of these in 2020
starting at number 9 we have the one by
Wacom medium version
but it includes all of the essentials
you'll need to make digital art
there is a smaller version of the one by
Wacom does not offer a display that you draw directly onto instead
and there's an option for connecting the tablet to your computer wirelessly with bluetooth
you can even connect the end to us to select
Android devices to draw on your phone using a portion of your drawing tablet surface
it also comes upon with software that you can use for making art and editing photos
the intros is twice as expensive as the one by
Wacom so you'll have to weigh whether the Express keys and additional pressure levels are worth it
this is the pro version of the Intuos with top-of-the-line features and specs at eight point
seven by five point eight inches
the medium intuos pro is only slightly larger than the regular Intuos medium but the large Intuos
Pro has a whopping active area of twelve point
one by eight point four inches because it's pro it's obviously more professional
it supports welcomes best pen
rotation pen tilt and rotation
make a huge difference
I personally prefer a surface with a bit of friction because it feels closer to drawing on paper
but it's not for everyone
this is the end of the line for tablets without a display from here on out
six is the welcome one
one wait didn't we already do this
okay so welcome likes to reuse names
this is the
Welcome one not to be confused with the one by Wacom the Wacom one was released in 2020
it's not essential to be honest
you can make the same quality art on the one by
drawing another notable difference
is that because the wacom
one is a display tablet
you will need to connect it to your device with a video cable
well you can do basic digital painting and drawing making art on
Android is not quite as robust as the experience you'd get by drawing on a Windows or Mac computer
that's not to mention that the
five is a pair of display tablets the Wacom Cintiq 16 and the Cintiq 22
these are essentially the same tablet just in different sizes aside from the difference in size
both sizes of this tablet are great but as you know
I prefer a large drawing surface so clearly
s-- require an hdmi video connection to a Mac or Windows computer
if you're more of a beginner or hobbyist and the pro level features don't matter to you choose the
now here's where we start to transition to tablets that are more for professional use
I'll be sharing some advice on
how many pressure levels you need and you might be surprised at my number one choice so stay tuned
13 is only a bit more expensive than the non pro
and instead there's an optional
Express key remote
I just prefer to use my keyboard so I can live without express keys as with the Wacom one
there are legs that fold out to provide a 20 degree angle to draw on
the stand can make a difference in terms of comfort
that is squished
we're talking the full version of Photoshop
I absolutely love it for painting outdoors or while traveling
the sixteen inch version of the mobile studio pro does support
is that the mobile studio pro uses mobile processors which prefer power saving over performance
a powerful desktop is going to provide the snappiest performance
money can buy the extra-large active drawing areas of the Cintiq pro 24 and 32
if money is no object
and if you do need to zoom pan or rotate the Cintiq
pro 24 and 32 support multi-touch both devices also support the pro pen 2 and you
HD screen resolution the color gamut accuracy on the Cintiq pro
they also have folding legs like the smaller
Cintiq pros with only one angle however you can buy a couple of different stands
there's the official
Wacom ergo stand and then there's the Wacom branded ergo flexor guitar on arm
I prefer the arm but both stands are great
these are some pretty beefy devices
they require a lot of desk space and they are not easy or convenient to lug around
these tablets are overkill for a beginner or hobbyist
or are they well
I know you're saying but Aaron you just told me that a larger tablet was better
I'll come back to the size issue
I know that's not the case now to be fair
so topping the list at number one is the
Wacom Cintiq 27 q HD touch
Goldilocks and I just think that the 24 feels too small and the 32 is too massive
that has the same pressure levels as my high-end
it's just a number
so it's not as elegant of a connection as the single
there's a similar official
I'd say if you can find a use two
I'd love to see
if you'd like to watch in-depth reviews of these drawing tablets
check out my drawing tablet review playlist
thanks for watching
I'll see you next time
hi guys this is
Luke from vo-tech again
today we have a review of a Chinese tablet via the company X Gobi
it's the t9 3q 9 inch tablet
there it is
we're going to review it right now and beard tech
let's check this thing out and see if it's any good let's have a look the X go
it's a 9 inch or winner a 33 quad core processor brick
TF card slot and DC charging port and micro USB charging slot
the interface is sluggish
kitkat which is quite old now
doing a thing
I've had to install
just to have the tablet run properly
I'll review kingroot in another video coming soon
the screen is only 800 by 480 pixels
and you can see all those pixels and the glass is super reflective and not very thick
either it's smudgy and will scratch with a breath or two on it
it also has a weird YouTube app
it doesn't work properly and look so clicky and blue and running videos on it it's terrible
run okay on it
just don't run anything
where speed is needed
you'll curl up into a ball and scream a lot
another technical feature of the live wallpapers
the cameras are totally awful with the front-facing camera being a zero point
I don't think you've ever seen it work though
I bought this to listen to the radio online in the kitchen
you're the bluetooth speaker
so technically that works the software continuously runs by apps and pop-ups with no intervention
so anything you want to do will be hampered by buggy a million software issues guaranteed
it's slow sluggish bus trailing and even mystifying
go for those pieces
the battery is good
Wi-Fi bluetooth it functions and stock Android
so that's good but it's still frustrating
it's an atrocious gaming device
poor multitasker bad audio device with speakers
horrible it's a terrible office tablet
it does come with a semi leathery case thingy with a keyboard but when you plug that in
they'll say you have a tablet and you say yes
please do that to the daughter mostly to show you anything please
it's recommended you do not buy this thing
I give it zero out of five beard
yes you heard me that
I've been Luke from being tech
you've been the audience
this is a review of the Xcode 89 3 cube
please do not buy it
please want people not to buy it like this video
we've got a lot more reviews coming up soon
we have weekly content
I've been lookin
be detective in the audience
have beer tastic fun
we will see you in the next one
see you guys
I finally broke down and bought a Fire HD tablet
was it worth it
let's take a look hello
let's get started
this is week number 13 of my 2019
Ecco series you could check out last year's series up here
I decided to buy one after using it
I have mixed feelings on it
it excels in some areas and in others
it just doesn't cut it as a tablet
let's see if it's worth it for you
first what do you get with the Fire
what that means is
Amazon does show ads on the home screen when you wake the device
the ads can be removed for $15
this is something that
that can be expanded
up to 400 gigabytes with a micro SD card
it includes a front and rear facing camera it has Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity for audio
you have stereo speakers
Doby audio and a headphone jack battery
I will say this is one of the most minimalist packages I've seen for a tablet
the packaging does say something about the durability
you do not have to baby this thing now leads me to the build quality
it is a plastic body with a gorilla glass screen
this thing does have a very durable feel
it is a heavy-duty device
this is an android-based tablet but it does not have native support for the Google Play Store
there are ways around that that I will explore in a future video
the home screen has a tab layout that shows the focus on this being an entertainment device
you have to have to take you to books
video games shopping apps music audible and newsstand
all these tabs are designed to jump right to amazon's various offerings
I shop on Amazon use audible Kindle books and prime video so the quick access is nice for me
I can hop to a book quickly
listen to an audible book or continue a show using these tabs a great benefit
I see with the Fire
HD tablet is when it's plugged in it goes into show mode once show mode is enabled
I'll get into the show mode features in another video
Amazon does have an app store where you can find many popular apps and games
I went through my iPad to see what I could find in
Amazon's app store that I already use
you can find various music and video streaming apps a few that
what's happened some others
were not available you will not find
you can also download
Microsoft Outlook there is no Microsoft Office Chrome browser and other apps
this is where this device is not worth it for me with my iPad or iPhone
I could take care of 90% of my work needs or tasks that I need to get done
I feel like it'd be a big step backwards to try and do those things
on this tablet
we take it for granted
now this does have a web browser but it is not Safari or Chrome
it feels clunky
and unimpressive so many things can be done today on a good web browser
this one just doesn't cut it the lack of Google services is very disappointing no
YouTube app is a bummer
I find the workarounds are not a good experience
I just rather use my phone
where the Fire HD tablet lacks even with these complaints
I do need to recognize that
this is a tablet under $100 sometimes even under $50 now on to what
I like I do think the strength of the Fire
HD tablet is in consuming content
the layout makes for quick navigation to audiobooks
this device can take abuse
I've been impressed at having an echo show that I can play live TV on watch
Netflix control
I don't like about the echo show
I would definitely recommend the Fire
HD tablet with the doc as an echo show alternative
so who is this for the biggest benefit
I see is using it like an echo show to enhance your echo experience
if you like to read listen to audiobooks watch videos or play games
this is a great device for you
I do not see this as a device for much beyond those uses
I need to get done to wrap this up even at full price
I think it's worth
it is a content device with show mode
let me know your thoughts in the comment section
there's also international links that will take you to your country's Amazon homepage
thank you for watching this
have a great day bye
Haggai so I bought the tablet recently and I wanted to check it out
this is a
Lenovo tablet called the Lenovo minx 310 and now and again
do you like to check out
Windows 10 tablets to see you know what they bring to the table
this is very affordable
I think it's an improvement over the last year's tablets
I have you know checked out
in terms of this caliber of device you can see the actual a viewing angles are pretty decent here
it's not going to compete with the laptop of a high caliber
I think a you can see
it's also fully at which screen here in terms of the responsiveness
so you can die from using the keyboard and the actual trackpad to actually using the screen
but you might want to keep that on to help with the glare issues because it is that
feel very nice and tactile
you know typing on them
the trackpad is a little bit more clicky than what
I'd like it to be
it feels a little bit cheap
you can see
I've noticed so that gives it
you know touch of class here at the end of the day
so let's just go into the operating system again so we are running
Windows 10 here no student Edition or anything
we can have a look here at some things I have installed in fact
let's just have a look at the actual general responsiveness
let's just be honest
I mean you're not going to be doing much heavy here
in terms of the performance you can see the screen looks absolutely fantastic when web browsing
it's very usable
just go to BBC
you see the page loads very quickly
unfortunately there's no support for 5g
Wi-Fi boy does use 2g Wi-Fi very well everything
those are extremely fast just as faster than online
dell in terms of the responsiveness
so you can see for web browsing absolutely marvelous
this is the 2gig
RAM model 32 GB internal storage
I want to do a little bit video editing and things like that you probably should get the full gig
I was a little bit concerned when I first got it
in regards to the available storage you can see after all the updates
it's like down to 8 2 gigs storage
were actually clogging up 10 gigs
take some space off the main emmc storage
so there's lots of expandability options here you can see is well we get
I've noticed it runs pretty slow compared to like for example a more powerful machine
Here I am using a wireless mouse as well so but it's very usable
you know in terms of you know getting a good game on
I just show you the the speaker as well
let's just turn up so you can see them a bit
I didn't even see a man
I'm dead flying really annoying so you can see it plays pretty well here
it does slow down a little bit when the action heats up
I'm no good at it anymore
I'm probably new to practice but oh I gotta kill it
well you know considering a very basic spec also
the battery is absolutely fantastic on this thing
I've been very impressed with this
this little tablet
here is quite heavy considering how small the actual devices also the cameras you know garbage
what's going on guys the
CTA pride back here again
today we're gonna be taking a look at the
Lenovo Tab m8f HD the F HD stands for full HD now
some of my regular viewers might be a little confused because recently
it does have more
I loved a design that lenovo's going for now build quality and design of these new Tab series
tablets is absolutely amazing
some of the best that
now hopefully this will change my mind
this has an 8 core 2.3 gigahertz CPU instead of a quad core 2 gigahertz and
it's packing an extra gig of ram over the m8
we have our power button and volume rocker
they've also left a 3.5
millimeter audio jack for your headphones
it's a single speaker setup it's tuned by Dolby and it does sound pretty decent
I mean it's not the loudest Ablett that I've heard but it'll get you by for a smaller tablet
and the tablet does support up to a 2 terabyte microSD card around back
we have an 8 megapixel camera in a very sleek aluminum design
this only comes in one color and it's known as iron gray one of the main things
I love about the new Lenovo
Tab series is the screens now
this is the best one that I've seen so far it's an 8 inch IPS
1080p display
it definitely looks better than the ma
we have the mediatek
P 22 T
v RG e 8320
unfortunately this is the same
GPU that was in the HD version three gigabytes of lpddr3 ram
it is a pretty stock version of Android but they have included some blow
most of it can be completely deleted
everything's been really smooth
I haven't had any issues at all
I mean overall
it's working great like most new tablets should and just like the m8
HD this is a great little tablet for viewing videos if you want to stream from let's say plex
I'm actually connected to a server
that's pretty far away from where
I am right now and I'm going to be streaming in 1080p
HBO amazon prime Hulu Netflix and even YouTube video
playback is great 1080p
I want to see how much more powerful this chip is
then the lower-end m8 HD and how it stacks up against 150 dollar Amazon Fire HD 10
so first up we have
Geekbench for single core for the eff HD version nine zero nine multi 39:56
we definitely beat out the ma
I also wanted to test out
Geekbench 5 single core 165 multi 878 even with the higher clock CPU in this tablet
we're right on par
with the single core score of the ma HD but it did beat it out in multi unfortunately
now it's time to move over to some GPU testing we have 3d mark with slingshot
and finally we have an 2 to 8 100 1766
it was much higher than the ma HD but again the fire 10 HD
beat this out
and if you're looking at a more expensive tablet think about the Tab s 6 at 300 77856
Android gaming here we have King of Fighters all-stars
this really comes down to it having the same exact
Call of Duty mobile
I'm using here
is the eye peg at 91 67
we have the redream emulator running
Dreamcast this is Soulcalibur
works great but this is an easier one to run but if we try to run something a little harder like
Dead or Alive - it's just not going to cut it
I've seen it dip down to around 38 fps in some situations
so it's definitely not going to run every
you can also stream from your own
Xbox one or your Xbox one X this is dirt rally 2.0 running in Project X cloud
I'm using the I Pegah 91 67 controller
I think this would be an awesome little option pair it with a controller like the AI
pega and you'll be good to go but the performance for native
Android gaming and emulation is very lackluster
for a hundred and sixty dollar tablet
so that's pretty much it for this video guys
I really appreciate you watching if you have any questions or you want to see anything else
tested with the lenovo tab and 8f HD just let me know in the comments below but like always
thanks for watching you
hello everyone welcome back to my channel
today i'm going to review another display tablet by xp1 which is xp and artist 22r pro
you can call it
the promo code is valid till thirty first december 2020
amazon link is also provided in the description
it has all the cables and other important stuff required to use the tablet
the tablet is packed
like this you can see
let me tell you one thing
this is very very heavy so handle it with care
so this is how the tablet looks like from the front it has 20 shortcut keys and two red dials
these two roller wheels on both sides
you have one wheel so it is a really nice feature
i will tell you its features later on in the video and you can adjust the angle as well like this
you can keep it at any angle of your choice like this like this also or simply like this
i had already removed this protective film which was on the tablet
now let me show you the contents of this box
this is a type c2c cable as you can see so it is very useful for mac users
then you will get an hdmi to hdmi cable
then this is the power adapter and power cord
there is another power cord this one and you get two pens with this tablet
one is inside this case
uh in this packet
if your laptop or computer has the hdmi port
then there is a glove with xp pen branding on it
a cloth for cleaning the surface of the tablet warranty card and a user manual
so these are the things you get along with the tablet
i will connect this plug to the pc and this plug to the tablet and the hdmi to hdmi cable
one end to the computer and one end to the tablet
these three cables are needed
inches and the resolution is 1080p
which is full hd to turn it on simply keep your finger here
that's it okay
so it is showing my computer screen
the first thing you need to do is to install the xp pen driver experiment software
this is the experiment software
you can see here xp pen artist
okay you can check the pen pressure like this
another great thing about this tablet is is its color accuracy
you can adjust the color temperature
srgb 5000k 6500k 7500k etc
and you can adjust the colors
i have currently assigned three features and by default
also you can see three features there so the first one is zoom in and zoom out
another one is you can change the brush size with the dial like this
okay you can see it is changing
you can use this tablet for multiple purposes
what do you think about this product and you have any doubts you can ask me
thanks so much for watching bye bye and take care
I go that's Chris here from tick tablets with the remix
ultra tablet here
they call it an ultra tablet because it has a keyboard and can do a bit of multitasking
it's not your average
Android tablet
I'll be using it now for a couple of weeks
its infancy here
so there's been a few little tiny minor bugs
there's nothing a major really but there have been updating and working hard the team on that so
I'm really impressed with this tablet
I just have to say that
so the price is quite good for what you get
so you have a 1080p screen here
which is a lovely screen
it's fully laminated
and it's one of the the best in a TV screens
I've actually seen in a while
so you have a very kind of surface to like tablet
you have a two-stage kickstand here
you can see underneath
you have hidden away a micro
I'd love to see more tablets with kickstands
there's really good the keyboard on this
I must say is really well done
very good to type on the keys are individually spaced out so you get a lot less typos
I even actually find it a lot better than my surface 3 keyboard which
I'll just show you right here
this is the surface 3 keyboard
and it's a high quality keyboard
but you could see that both of these keyboards have about the same thick
I noticed that the keyboard on the remix will pick up a lot of dust and dirt quite quickly
it's just a minor complaint there
the trackpad works really well
which is what the focus of this tablet is basically all about being a productive
Android tablet it puts in there just like that you can fold that back
which would put the tablet into sleep mode
so that's a tiny little minor little nibble there that
I wish it would clip in there just a little bit nicer be slightly stronger there
the magnets in there but overall it fits pretty good
it's not too bad it's just you have to sometimes be careful when you do pick up
just the tablet and let the keyboard flop down that it could just come off now
it is powered by a Tegra 4
which isn't the latest and greatest
there's no like stutters or legs
you have that on top
so their focus
is there really or the multitasking
here and the back button here you can control the volume straight away from the speakers which
I'll just show you in a minute
you can pop that up straight away just from a quick button
so no need for that
if you don't like it perhaps you're typing and you know that you do have it so
I'll move around a little but it's interfering with it typing
it does come with quite a good application here that I do like
which is the office application
they do like that so again
you can you quickly just swap over so you want to go back and -
I'll look here at Google
Play and I'm just running actually in the background just a couple of downloads
GPS wireless vibration is quite handy
I just played a little bit if it sits down there I will show you a couple of benchmarks but first
I'm just going to flip over to the browser here
they're quite good tablet speakers there and the front-facing webcam is a microphone on the front
and there's a webcam on the rear as well that also has a microphone
well it's actually all right
it does okay
it might have been something to do with the the taskbar they have at the bottom
that caused this
it didn't seem to appear later on when I was benchmarking so this is unreal Citadel
it's not maybe the fastest
but it's still quite good
I think and this is the ice storm unlimited score 3dmark not a bad score and I should have here
it's the current application memory cleanup
so that's quickly just closed everything there just so
I get they
they are maximum performance
here out of the game so
and there's there's nice leather in there that all runs fine
this isn't the most demo demanding game
of course okay
they do have a charger
thank you for watching a video and do subscribe to my channel
I will have more up and coming videos of other tablets from China
bye for now
hi this is
pro it's got this built-in kickstand that's adjustable to a number of different angles
V and change it in different situations
holds everything in place nicely and works at a variety of different angles
two USB type-c ports one is USB 3 and the other is Thunderbolt 3
which is something you don't get on
Microsoft Surface tablet full-size USB port and another full-size USB port
there's also these volume buttons down here
on the back
and a fingerprint sensor the fingerprint sensor is pretty effective
I do have about it
I've been testing this device
I did start to get to use
start to get used to the volume buttons
sit out a little bit from the edge but not too much another thing
it is a n-trig
Windows ink certified pen
that has a quadruple a battery on the inside
I'm not gonna subject you to watching me
click to open context menus so dependent functionality
works pretty well
the tablet has a starting price about seven hundred and ninety nine dollars
and that gets you some pretty nice basic hardware including everything that I mentioned before
not a lot
that helps this device be relatively energy efficient and relatively cool
it keeps it from overheating
this particular model was loaned to me by
it's in the same family as the core
so it's some in terms of day to day performance
it works pretty well
it won't necessarily do quite as well on certain benchmark tests but
there's a good reason for that
this display is a 3.2 aspect ratio screen it's a 28 80 by 1920
XO display which is pretty nice for most respects
I do find that
I've used it for Netflix
I've used it for work
ok crank that down a little bit you just
Starcraft 2 which recently went free-to-play
I went ahead and installed and it loads and then crashes
I could not get that they into play at all
I'm not sure if that's because of the processor or something else though clearly
it's a tablet that you could use for work for play for all sorts of different things
which is something that you've said
Eve says you should be able to get around 8 hours
I found that when I'm using it for a heavy web browsing and web work
I get more like 5 or 6 hours of battery life
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and just watch local video so overall it's a pretty nice device
the keyboard sort of you know covers it and protects it the keyboard
I should also mention
has this sort of fabric
finish very nice to touch but it also is a little bit of a dust not just magnet but trap
I find it's kind of hard to keep clean and living in a house with three cats
there's plenty of dust and cat hair in the house
I should also point out that this is at 200% scaling
they need a little bit more sort of room on your screen you could go to maybe 175 or 150
I think that that's perfectly doable
but I think that the 200% recommended scaling works pretty well for most situations
sort of full-size content when
I'm looking at two different web pages but that's just because of the way that I tend to work
if your needs are different there are a whole bunch of different things you can do
I look at it so that is a quick look at the Eve V tablet
there should be more units available
I'm just not entirely sure that this is the right sort of device for me
I do think that the performance is pretty good
you can check out some benchmark scores and other details at little of
that's for primarily document editing web browsing
buting and again you can find more details at lilliputian com
hello everyone today
this was sent to me by gearbest for reviewing
but don't worry along with all the pros
I'll also be talking about the cons
I did mention in my own boxing video how I felt
this could be a cheap alternative to walk-ons interest pen tablets
the cheapest interest is the interest draw small at approximately 60 pounds in the UK
it has an active area of 6 by 3.7 inches and comes with 4
Express keys in comparison
Fuji's m7o 8 has a 10 by 6 interactive area
having a larger active area means
there's more space to move the drawing hand around around smooth and natural stroke
large active area is also more preferable for large screen resolutions
workflow interest rule has 2
Express keys to the left and 2 to the right
I don't find having a cable attached a problem
the cable is 1.3 meters long
which is good if you have
the computer positioned at a distance but with my laptop
it's hard to say how long the battery will last
because it entirely depends on how powerful the battery unit
it is the most
we vary between 700
mah to 1100 mah
I also notice the surface of M 708
active area didn't get any scratches from using the pen
I remember my Wacom
in comparison to the size
I use the tablet and even though I have my eyes fixated on the screen of April
I could see the bright blue flashing lights in the corner of my eye once
I'm done with this review
I am so going to cover it with black insulating tape
the driver was easy
the driver doesn't conflict with any other existing drivers on the map
the settings is also very easy and pretty self-explanatory
there is no delay in the function happening what
straights produced are beautiful and flow of them
feels nice smooth and natural
I came across zero problem
the coloring was not my best mainly because
I'm still working on learning how to draw on Photoshop
I did a jitter test with pressure levels off to try and get the most accurate results
there is of course some jitter even
Wacom tablets produce a tiny amount of jitter
I would say there is ever so slightly more gesture than my work on mobile shoo
I tested out in Clips
you do pain
it plugged in and then come back to wake my MacBook
Pro up from sleep and use the n7o 8 straight away
let's talk about how it performs on windows
I try to reinstall the Wacom drivers after you
DS driver have installed it simply made the V's fly ever disappear
which was very strange
the driver itself doesn't take you long to install and once it is installed the tablet settings
in comparison to max which is a good thing as it allows space for more customization it also meant
I leave a link to the Windows setup video in the description box the response
I get when pressing an Express key is immediate
the streets produced are beautiful
the flow of ink from the pen feels really nice
smooth and natural
I found whenever I wanted to click on something
in the taskbar the cursor would have a spasm in fact
I had no issues with clear system
the pen works flawlessly on the XPS 12
I also found that
I've got no pressure levels in some programs like medivac
I had 12 have conflicting issues with Uzis drivers
workflow jitter
let's have more than others the end 708 on Windows
crashes or any need to unplug and we can at the end 708 after waking up windows
the tablet is instantly usable as soon as it's plugged in overall
I really enjoyed using Iggy's and 708
it was nice to use a larger pen tablet
my previous pen tablet was a Wacom Bamboo which was smaller and the active area was limited
I would definitely recommend this as a pen tablet for anyone looking to start off with a cheap yet
highly functional tablet
there don't ever feel like you have to spend lots of money to be able to create beautiful artwork
honestly art is about improving step at a time
so there's no reason not to upgrade your tools
step at a time as well
that's it from me guys
hello everyone this is aldrin here and welcome back to another video
i'm absolutely excited to see you guys all and today
we're unboxing a laptop
this is the lenovo legion five
i bought for myself and around 900 us dollars
this is the budget gaming laptop according to many reviews
so i'm absolutely excited to get this unboxed
so why don't we just straight up
started okay so we have
here is a box
uh and now you can see it
the lioness tech tip unboxing and i'm just really excited
let me just smell this nice smell of plastic and i love it
how do you open this by the way
no oh i see so you basically like lift this up and the laptop follows
that's really cool
actually you know this
they should put this in many like budget laptops
when you just unbox this you just lift this up
yeah i like this actually
uh do i do this as well because i'm actually really bad at unboxing stuff obviously
do you just literally lift laptop
oh yes excitement
oh yes excitement
of course extra dramaticness
let's just put the laptop aside and let's see what we have and over here
get this nicely packed actually
it's quite nice
it's got a really nice texture just for this side there you go throw it away
let's see what we have down here
why is this bulging
why okay so what we have is a very badly packed cable
okay cool this this typical british cable so very nice a bunch of papers here
congratulations on your recent lenovo pages and a bunch of you know services stuff
i'll show you then this side
we have over here
legend 5 15 inch or 17 inch got that setup guides the typical setup stuff
put this aside
have the safety and warranty guide to this bunch of safety stuff
i'll keep this side
i'll keep this actually
oh this is actually pretty cool
this is i mean this is quite heavy
let's get this down
i don't think there's anything else inside here
there you go and let's put it aside
let's see if it actually has anything inside
no i think not
the box itself is quite sturdy as you can see by the way
this laptop is shipped with just this box
i'll get this box aside
you have served me well
of course i'm gonna just clip this in cool
i'll put these aside
here comes the really exciting bit
actually this is actually quite heavy so just straight up
get this unboxed
i believe it comes from here
okay really nice packaging
let's get this
oh yes look at this by the way what
what's this i see
i don't know just put this side and put the bag aside by the way
this is actually quite good quality
put it inside there
you go so we have the laptop itself now first impression is actually
it's quite good looking
that feels like a laptop which is cool again
uh by the way if you can see the lenovo legion logo over here
you can see that it's kind of what is this shiny polychromatic stuff
yeah there's some unique materials over here
that are making weird lights cool
here's the i o as you can probably see
we have two large outlets on the back
i'm not sure if it's gigabit or not but it's an ethernet jack
we have usb type c
we have two usb type
a's we have one hdmi
i believe that's 2.0
that's quite cool and we have a
i believe that's power inlet and then there's a kensington lock oopsies
just save this and over here we have a 3.5 inch headphone jack and one uh usb 2.0
i don't think that's 2.0
maybe it's 3.9
i'm not very sure
and that's kind of the outside
we have the nice lenovo logo hits like brushed metal kind of finish which is quite cool
okay so from the looks of things
i'm just gonna place it in the center of the camera from the looks of things
there's two large fans i can see the fan blade
there is basically a huge intake all the way from the top to the bottom
there are two speakers on the side
i'll show you there
you go this speaker
uh there are these rubber pads that stand on the table uh and everything else is plastic
well it's okay
it's it feels pretty well built
it's a pretty well built piece of plastic and it doesn't feel like this
that is too much fingerprint
now this feels all right
it feels pretty good and let's get this open
just be really careful
around the hinge over here
the hinge
the hinge looks pretty cool
it's slightly green for some reason and the edge
i don't know if you can see or not
let's take a look on the inside of this thing and i'm not the real inside of this thing
just open this up
get the hinge going
okay i can open one hand which is really cool
okay and get this silky stuff down
it looks quite sleek obviously
it doesn't really look like a game
laptop uh yeah
this actually looks pretty nice
and an nvidia gtx 1650 cool
uh now let's give it a touch
see how it feels
oh my god this actually feels really nice
it's almost like soft touch but it's not really soft but it's soft at the same time
uh i really like this kind of texture
i really like it
uh the keyboard
let's give it a touch
oh yes i see why the reviewers say that
this is a good keyboard so this has really good travel
uh it sounds really nice well and um it has really tactile feeling
like it's the clicks are really really obvious
you can just feel the clicks going on and i think this keyboard will be great for gaming
the screen looks decently big
it's decently big
uh there's a promising shot over here on the webcam
let me just show you over here
we have the privacy
hello hello hello please focus okay
good you see
get the lenovo logo over here again
get the large leads
you know logo over here you get this
i do like this laptop from the first like first like what five minutes 10 minutes
yeah it gave me a really good impression and overall just looks quite well built
it doesn't feel really like flimsy and all that kind of stuff
the hinge feels secure
i mean if this laptop is any lighter this hinge
um yeah it feels quite well built
i really like it first impression
very nice
uh and let's try to open this up and see if it boosts up
i guess let's just press the button
anything happening hello
this is free feels like pretty
well built pc
i guess that's all for today's video
i stopped thinking about owning one today
let's find out
the tablet sports an 11.6 inch ips
aesthetically the joy 11 feels really bulky and heavy as a tablet
and you wouldn't feel comfortable holding it single-handedly
the tablet has its power volume and windows button placed at the rear
the specs of the jaw 11 is kind of dated in today's standards
the tablet
fortunately comes with 64 gigs of emmc storage and can be expanded via a microsd card
the front and rear side of the tablet features the same 2 megapixel camera
according to my tests the keyboard dock is a little bit disappointing in some way
and at times i use it for watching netflix
the device is rather capable in many ways and performance is quite okay for simple use
i was of course careful enough not to open too
but i actually do not find it too bad to see screen
brightness is neither too glaring nor dark and the ips panel
does its job
the joy 11 gets very warm after a certain duration of usage
yes but maybe not you see
i like the fact that this product gives me
i still find windows
- What's the best tablet deal of the year?
(cash register dinging) (upbeat, warm music)
And, I have a huge giveaway.
I got a lot of requests since a video
I did awhile ago on an 8-Inch Tablet From Amazon, to put the new Fire HD 10 tablet to the test.
This has Alexa built in, which means you don't necessarily need to buy an Amazon Echo.
You can just speak directly to your device, and get all of your questions answered.
Alexa, are you better than Siri?
So, first, let's just look at the speed before I get to some crazy drop tests.
They both respond at basically the same time.
Maybe a second apart between the two tablets.
The iPad has a better processor.
Let's look at a YouTube video.
Video load time actually identical between the two.
Laptops to tablets, to how to score a free Xbox One or PlayStation-- Wow, this guy's annoying.
I love to do the humor test.
Let's do that.
Alexa, tell me a joke.
- [Alexa] Knock, knock. Who's there?
Cash. Cash who?
No, thank you, I'm allergic to nuts.
- A decent joke.
Tell me a joke.
- [Siri] Matt, I don't really know any good jokes.
None, in fact. - Seriously, they have to reprogram.
That's not cool.
The streaming video on the HD 10 is amazing.
Yes, it's great in Itunes.
That was amazing.
Everything is optimized to an extreme.
So, I'm skipping ahead, skip ahead another ten seconds, it's very, very, fast, very responsive.
Great audio. Beautiful.
I mean, this is $150.
I love it.
Keep in mind, this is not a Kindle.
You guys want to try it at home, it breaks, try it.
Don't worry, I paid for the damage.
You wanna watch that video.
I am not going to do this against a hardwood floor
this time, but the tablet sustained the smashes, the floor did not, so...
Let's do the backside.
No crack. And, now let's do the front side down.
You know, guys, this is a stainless steel table.
I'm gonna show you what the table looks like in a moment, but the screen is completely okay.
I'm now going to smash this with all my might against the side of the table.
(tablet smacking) Awesome!
Totally unscathed, and still, completely touch-responsive. Everything's working.
You want more?
Oh, my microphone and my...
Oh no, it's my phone that fell. It's fine. (laughs) Still working.
Perfectly good, perfectly responsive, no movement whatsoever.
Like, it works, which is absolutely amazing, given that...
See? It's still loading. This is...
You know what?
Let's look at the table.
Let me show you what the table looks like right now.
This wood dent here.
Actual indentations, scrapes, marks, the tablecloth was not in particularly good shape.
The tablet is completely fine.
Look at that. Absolutely fine. The table, not so much.
One of the things I love about this tablet, is that, at its core, it's an Amazon Echo.
Alexa, what's the weather in Toronto?
Share a thought from the cloud. - [Alexa] A friend of mine is the voice for an elevator.
Seems like a cool job.
But I bet it has a lot of ups and downs.
Alexa, turn my couch light off.
And, with Dolby Audio speakers, it's also a good music system if you are traveling.
Alexa, play music by Madilyn Bailey.
(tablet rings softly) - [Alexa] Shuffling songs by Madilyn Bailey.
(tablet playing pop ballad music)
I actually prefer, just 'cause I'm used to it, the way the iPad feels in my hand.
But, the second I want to watch a movie, and shift from this mode to landscape mode...
Sorry, I absolutely love the way
the content looks on this.
That widescreen viewing is particularly good for streaming, and Netflix, and Amazon Prime.
Okay, I didn't even...
I had to buy my own.
You want yours for free?
You're so lucky.
Congratulations goes to, Connor Rebooted, you wanted a Nintendo Switch.
I'm sorry, but congratulations, you just got a free Fire HD 10.
Yes! You've won! Whoo! Awesome.
- I'm proud of you, too.
And for those of you
that just watch, who are like, wow, that was, that was interesting.
Just click on my head
right here, that'll subscribe you to this channel.
this is the high ten plus
and what makes this extra special is
it's actually a dual boot tablet
so you can boot it into either Google Android or indeed Windows
so let's take a look around the back first of all maybe a closer look at this
this is a little camera at the top here so we have got a rear facing camera
it is not a great performer by any means
I'm not impressed at all with the camera
quality but then who takes photos with tablets anyway
we've got an Intel 64-bit quad-core said seven
we've got the main power on/off button and also the volume rocker and then round on this side
we've also got a headphone jack and we've got a micro
SD card slot if we look down on the bottom
we've just got a little pinhole microphone just about here
the back of the device looks very very nice
indeed it's in this gray color and overall
I think this is a really good tablet now
it has also got a front-facing camera but what
I want to just emphasize to you that this does run Windows and also Google Android now admittedly
I'm being completely honest here
I think the display is very very good indeed
I think it's a really nice IPS display and that resolution
very very impressive now
I think dual-boot tablet is a great option for a lot of people
it's a great little tablet decent performance
very very good price and indeed
I like the chamfered edges actually just to touch on this build quality
this is the chewy high 10
plus thank you very much for watching if you've got any questions at all
leave them in the comment section below
don't forget to hit that like button
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you in another video very soon
hi folks how you all doing today
I want to look at the arts
it is a fairly well respected brand in amongst drawing tablets for budget artists for artists
just starting out
and this tablet itself is a 16 inch drawing tablet with a 1080p screen and hotkeys
in terms of screen
this is a 1920 by 1080p screen
which is pretty usual for a 15.6
that's a 16 inch screen and yeah it looks pretty good
this is a coated screen
isn't that bad at all and you can see that in my pen test
obviously if you need to jump ahead to that or you can watch
obviously one of the few drawing tests that
I've done on this as well
how much of a budget you're on so let's jump into the unboxing portion of the video here
we go looking at the back of the artists all the sixteen box
I'm just gonna get everything out and line it all up so you can see all of the pieces together
there's some interesting pieces coming straight out which I'll get to will
don't worry
the first thing that I notice however is that there's a stand here with the D 16
that's very cool
you have a jog wheel as well as the hot keys which is pretty cool
I'm left-handed so I want these on the right hand side
which is why you're looking at the tablet upside down
don't worry about that
just left-handed people like me
yep who use it the other way around all of those hotkeys feel pretty stable
the jog wheel feels pretty nice
now you also get this little pen holder attachment here as well your pen just solidly clicks
it has 8000 levels of pressure
it's a pretty decent feeling pen nice and solidly built
the nib has quite a bit of movement but didn't bother me too much
so here's the pen case
it's made of a really nice feeling felt
I I was really surprised by this
it's just a really nice thing
I'd like a lot of other tablets to come with this to be honest inside
I found a free gift of twenty nibs
don't know if I wanted to call these a gift personally but yeah there you go
twenty nibs is pretty good next up the stand
I don't think this kneading it an instruction manual but hey the stand is pretty good
it has a lot of different adjustable levels
yeah absolutely fantastic
there's an instruction manual as well for the tablet
I never read these things personally
I don't but there you go
it's there it is Illustrated
it's in a few different languages but also in that packet
oh yes you get an artist glove hahahaha again something
sorry I have to take off this article of now because I I just
I can't wear them
we've drawing experience at all and it actually doesn't make the cable really really sturdy
this is a standard wall outlet
so here's where it's going to get interesting the pen test over 8,000 levels of pressure and 5080
LPI pen resolution but I'm not so sure that this has pen tilt actually
I don't think it does
the lines are consistent as much as
I'm pushing down and trying to test that you know pressure curve
I'm getting thick when I want thick
I'm getting thin when I want thin and getting fast
I'm getting slow
I'm getting everything I expect to see in a normal pressure test so yeah fully fully
I'm nice smooth even lines
I don't use lines moving in my test
you should never do that because you will get lag
remember lag is caused by the programs and the computer never by the pen or the tablet
that's just an old wives tale now
the camera is down as low as possible with the monitor tablet so you can see clearly here
the parallax and their parallax is virtually zero
which is absolutely awesome for a budget
tablet like this link in the description if you want to go and chase one yourself
this is pretty awesome for a tablet
I'm happy with the way that this is turned out moving on
so that's the pen test and while that works
I know a lot of you guys like manga and comic books
so yeah because this doesn't have till at least
I don't think so
I thought I would do something a little more like that to show off what this pen
this tablet could do give the axial d16 a bit more of a trial room before
yeah so let's test that out
who here is a big fan of the
Dark Crystal show on Netflix
I'm drawing at the moment
drawing tablet is that it's actually really good for line drawing
I found this about some of the budget
it's a nice inexpensive application
here's the first draw test and I was happy with how this tablet performed this for me
I the one thing is from this camera angle
the matte finish doesn't look right
here you can see there's different straightaway
of course this is a budget tablet so if you want to make sure that your colors are spot on then
why would you need to be color
accuracy isn't at the forefront of your mind so don't worry about it go ahead just have fun
X and learn to draw overall though it was absolutely fine
I've got to say I had plenty of fun drawing on this and it worked out perfectly for me
I did manage to create a nice piece of artwork in the end something
I was happy with
you know just for a nice little sketch and what was
I'm happy to say you can create both on this tablet for me
a tablet like this requires all of my minimum requirements
you know it's 15.6 so 16 inches
it has some hotkeys
probably the thing
I used most as you can see by you
know my thumb using that for brush sizes and for the zoom but yes
I think some people are gonna say yes to some things and no to others
so it's personal choice
which things you want but on a day to day basis
I think it's personal choice
which things you want
um if you've got the money then you are just going to pay more and have it all but for some people
this might be the tablet for you but you really need the hotkeys and you really want a stand
do you understand hahaha
that's actually four different draw tests
that's pretty cool so I'm doing a few different styles here
I think they've come along amazingly well and given how much this tablet cost
you can google that you know your respective countries
I also think you
can you know make your own
comparisons as long as I give you all the information you know
I hate doing comparison videos
my ideal is always to go for the best pen technology possible and go for the best screen size
that's right for you go for the biggest screen possible
this is a 15.6 screen and the pen technology as you can see
I can produce some decent art even though you know
it doesn't have the best pen in the world
but it's up to you what you're looking for depending on the kind of art that you produce
so that's why
I'm putting so many different pen tests in here
let me know what you think in the comments below especially to the color artworks that
I have produced the sketches that I've done okay so moving on to our next draw test here
I want to do a longer sketch
we're gonna spend just an hour or so during a sketch
I'm gonna speed it up so you only have to watch me for what about four four minutes so yeah
they were kind of flocked covered
I don't know how to explain it
but yeah they used to have action figures covered in flocking like fell
but that's how ideas happen
that's how you start drawing from your imagination you just come up with something and think
I'd like to know what that looks like
so you draw it cuz nobody else is gonna and you know if you type that into Google
nothing good will come of it so yeah you have to draw it yourself so
I spent an hour so drawing that
I had in my weird imagination
you know the hokies the stand
this actually got down exactly what
I had in my weird little imagination
here is my final draw test now the reason
I've done so many draw tests
was it bad
has you know all the hotkeys
it has a stand coming with it but do you know what it is
it's a budget tablet
it's not for you guys who are like me who
Wacom users who you know who have 20 years experience in digital art
it is a tablet made for those just starting out
this is the kind of tablet
that's gonna change
somebody's life who who's this their first tablet
this is their second tablet
this is allowing them to start their journey
if that's you out there then you're gonna absolutely love this
you can see the kind of work that I've been able to do
and if you go and look at my portfolio on my website
I'm drawing right now
this is an image from a Christmas
carol which is one of my favorite books out there so yes
I think this tablet is really good at that but you know I think
yeah it's pretty much
there's nothing wrong with this tablet
I've been on many tablets just like this
the monitor tablets
I had when I was just you know when they were just starting out was perfectly adequate
I was drawing on digital
a drawing tablet like this would have been a godsend
it's not about the equipment you use you become a better artist by the work you put in
you can be happy with that if you can find it for a good deal has a matte screen
it has hot keys
it has a quick dial all programmable
let me know what you think in the comments about sketches that
I've made in these draw tests
let me know what you think about the pen tests everything
let me know what you're using at the moment to create our
let me know if you think this is better than something like a drunk tablet without a monitor
I would love to hear your thoughts and comments below
I chat to you all soon
have an amazing day
hello everyone
I'm going from guitar
tin and you're watching the review of eyeballed slide i-70 one performance tablet now
this tablet is running
Windows 8.1 with 1gb RAM and 16gb of internal storage
you also get a free
HDMI cable and three colorful covers
specifications are clearly mentioned on the box
and there's a built-in battery of 3200
mAh capacity here is the box pack and here is the mini HDMI to standard cable
that came free with this box
pack this tablet is available for a price tag of just rupees 4999
inside the box you'll find the slide
I 7:01 soft protective
cover a cleaning cloth to clean up this screen
pack is the travel charger along with the microUSB pin the eyeball slide
I 7:01 is a 7 inch
the rear side is black color
matte finish with velvety touch
this is the speaker went
USB port on the left side and there is a micro SD card slot at the bottom
there are no physical navigational buttons on the front panel disturb it comes with a 3200
mAh built-in battery weight with battery is 271 grams
and it is nine point
double 9 mm thick
it's running Windows 8.1
out of the box and it will get the Windows 10 upgrade as per the company
you will get around
4 point 8 5 GB free space
it's a seven inch screen width:1024 by 600 pixels resolution
and the major issue with this tablet is the screen quality
the viewing angles are no good from several angles
I change these settings just to give you an idea
this is how the screen looks
it is not at all good but you can improve it a little bit
to the native resolution by default it is set to 1 to 8 0 by 768 resolution
I'm going to change to default native resolution that is 1 0 to 4 by 600 pixels
and now let's check out the camera and yes it is working
it's a 2 megapixel camera
don't expect too much out of it
you can check the sample images on my website
you can use this tablet in portrait as well as landscape mode
I am now connecting this 64 GB
pen drive yes this is a 64
let's load the file
explorer here is the pen drive 64 GB and I'm also able to access the contents of this pen drive
I will try running an exe file
I have this tally
application and let me tap on tally 9
the screen size is so small that it is difficult tapping at the right point
okay so here
is the tally light application
that's running on this tablet
I'm running this exe file from an external drive
I am now going to use the HDMI cable
that came free with this tablet going to attach the mini
the tablet screen will be mirrored on this screen as you can see
i'm using the sony
bravia tv with full HD resolution and as you can see it's not using the full screen on the TV
it's the same 64
GB pen drive and I'm going to connect this mouse
receiver it's a wireless mouse receiver and this is the mouse that I'll be using
the sound
output is coming out of the TV so I'm going to reduce the TV volume
here is mouse
it's much simpler faster and easier using a mouse now
this tablet is connected with the TV
and it's using the mirror mode
let me go to the display
settings here is the display option
and as you can see it is set to duplicate the display
this means you get the output both on the tablet as well as on the TV
I'm going to change the multiple display option to show only on two
that means the display will show only on my TV and as you can see
I'm getting full screen on TV
this is a Sony
TV with full HD resolution 1 9 2 0 by 1 0 8 0 pixels and
it is using the full resolution capacity so technically my tablet has become a CPU now
I have connected the wireless mouse as well as the USB pendrive
you will be able to work faster
I'm going to try installing the nova bench
3 benchmark application and while installing it requires the net framework ok
I am going to install that too as already mentioned
the knower benchmark
it's now asking to install another application
I'm going to cancel that because I've got limited storage space
I'm going to try playing the Wolfenstein enemy territory game
the whole package is installed on the external storage
and let's see what happens it works
I'm getting a smaller window
but yes the game is working now
this is the online game and I am already connected to the Wi-Fi network
I will not be able to play this game because I have not connected
the external keyboard there is lag but the game should be playable
ok the next thing
the screen quality on the tablet is not that great
but you can always connect an external screen using HDMI cable after one r51
the battery dropped by
21% the eyeball slide i-70
one is as good as a netbook but with limited storage space of 16gb
the screen quality is not that great however for the price tag of rupees 4999
this is a very good option if you don't have a PC at home but have a HDMI TV
you can buy this tablet a keyboard and a mouse and kind of have a low cost
desktop for under rupees 6000 you
the doodoo from fusion garages caused quite a stir here at stuff on paper
let's find out so underneath this huge 12.1 inch screen
you'll find a 1.6 gigahertz Atom processor Nvidia ion graphics and a 4 gig SSD all encased
the juju is pretty big now
you can override this sensor to make everything just a little bit brighter
your only option is to pretty much weight
which is rubbish
still once you are online
the experience isn't stifled by it
the lack of flash support and working in the cloud is brilliant
it's just a shame
there's no way to install client software for the likes of Spotify or Skype
Lulu directly into a browser-based PDF reader
there's no media player software installed either
the speakers are horrible though so plugging in your headphones to the 3.5 millimeter
jack is a must
so there's a lot to fix before the juju can go up against even a netbook
it has decent hardware it runs
but perhaps this could all be saved by a future firmware update
this is Lisa from mobile tech review
and this is the HTC Flyer 7-inch Android tablet
this will be available at
it's really just the bezel on the back you can see we have that very clean up kind of I pad metal
look with the curved sides on it
it's nice it's a little bit appliance
white maybe here with these rubber end caps and here
we've got your volume controls power button up top here headphone jack
this is the front video camera and your five megapixel rear main camera is here now
this does not have a user replaceable battery
there you go
it has 16 gigs of internal storage
put your own movies on there
pictures whatever it is you want
Buy you have to buy it separately for I believe
$80 this is an active digitizer pen that means it has a battery inside
it requires power to operate
this is what the box looks like
you can see the best by co-branding on here
and we'll show you that later so the flyer is a 7-inch Android tablet
Froyo you've got 16
it's a single core but it's quite fast at 1.5 gigahertz in fact it did very well on quadrant
Tegra phone results on Linpack
it did a stunning 47 of course
Linpack does favour Qualcomm GPUs
and that's what this hasn't signed but still very impressive
so you can see the three of them together
obviously they're similar in size
next back view
HTC looks you know like an HTC phone kind
it's got that curved
look in the silver
7 inch the grandfather of 7-inch
Android tablets
I guess you could say obviously science wise
they're about the same and they're both quite bright when they're set the maximum brightness
it's very easy for your fingers in your eyes
you've got all your great
send stuff your questions
I inflict clock with the weather over here
you see the 3d effect as you go through here on the camera
I'm not sure it's the easiest thing to control of it
it's an interesting effect so here we're gonna take a look at the HTC software
it's my one they were gonna show you the unlock screen and this is interesting
you see your applications over here
if you don't actually want to unlock the device
you just wanna quickly go to calorie just drag
its and lock ring pretty cool so on the bottom here we have
of course capacitive touch buttons for your home
your menu button your back and this is for the pen
I will show you that in a minute
this is the pen aware spot here
if you touch that it brings up the two pen
print it share via or save it
and we're gonna discard this one and notice
it's known they're taking application so here we are in the note taking application which
it's an incredibly useful application
you can actually throw photos on their web pages
all that kind of thing sounds so
here's a blank note right here
and we've actually created a couple of notes the user interface is largely self-explanatory
now how do
I get to my list of all notes
so here's a note
I created earlier
Corel Painter or one of the other painting applications like our traits
you can choose your brush
you can use an ink a highlighter paint
I'm going to go with red
we want to go back and you know sweep you with color
this is oil paint style
Windows tablet PC at school to doing those very handy drawback there is no ink to text conversion
so that's the notes application and again this does sync with
this is really
Kobo books and it starts out with a nice cover view of all the books that are on board
and we're going to take a look at Jane
here gives you a bunch of public domain books for free
its opening in the book
and you've got the cute page-turner animations and it looks like it
you go back to something brighter
you can change your display language
pick the account that you use with
Kobo books and again you can choose your font size
it's portable these same sizes no caller
basically it's good for you
we'll take a look at watch
we do not have an account on this store
but there's a place where you can buy some movies and TV shows from HCC service
you can say we have a choice of 15 movies 15
shows are $2.00
let's gonna
this can play 480 and 720p video 1080p video
that's a pretty high bitrate video
it's looking very nice the 1.5 gigahertz processor and
I'd say it's a bit more stable and reliable actually done the Samsung Galaxy Tab
it's doing a good job
third person has a YouTube player
for those times
imap4 you name it
it should work with as well
email accounts this
we're going to take a look at HDMI output
and it's a bit blocky because we're not putting out 1080 to this 1080p 42 inch DVD
but it's not bad looking either so that's HDMI output
good for mirroring
it's gonna be $4.99 at Best Buy Wi-Fi only available May 22nd
it's a very nice 7-inch tablet
the only the only thing that holds us back from hardly recommending
this is the fact that it doesn't run
kind of stuff
we can see why
HTC thought that they could do some value added by throwing
they're a very popular sense on a tablet
but just keep in mind that it's probably going to be into the road
be sure to visit mobile tech review for the full review of detailed information on battery life
and just about everything else you want to know about this tablet
Let’s take a look at the Gaomon PD1560 screen drawing tablet.
The tablet worked great in all five programs
None of the other programs had this issue.
My top critiques are
If you’re having these problems the solutions are in this review.
The PD1560 costs less than similar tablets from other companies.
The other tablets are a little bit bigger, yet they have few or no shortcut buttons.
On a Wacom
Personally I don’t notice
The screen has a protector over it.
You can leave it on or take it off.
I tried drawing with it off and the there was noticeable resistance between the pen and the glass.
I’d be worried about the screen
getting scratched over time without a protector.
My PD1560 had some kind of oily effect between the protector and the screen when I unpacked it.
Wearing a glove helped reduce the oil
Then I put the screen protector back on.
Problem solved.
The tablet comes with a pen.
Pen holder filled with extra tips.
The bottom of the holder is a pen tip remover.
A USB to charge the pen once in a while. A one finger glove and a two finger glove.
You get both so you can choose which kind you like.
A combination HDMI-USB-power cable.
The power plug.
The stand.
A screwdriver and screws for the stand.
And the manual.
There’s one more thing the PD1560 comes with, and that is a carrying case for your tablet screen.
This is actually really cool, and I wasn’t expecting it.
I don’t feel worried at all about using the case.
You can’t tell from the video, but this tablet is lightweight.
The stand is heavier than the tablet.
It’s the most portable screen tablet I’ve used.
Take your folded up stand and turn it so
the long bar goes toward the top of the label.
Insert the bottom two screws into the holes.
Pull the slider at the back of the stand and insert the top two screws.
Everybody else, carefully
place the stand on the tablet as is.
You’ll feel the screws line up with the holes.
You can wiggle the stand a bit to make sure they get in there.
Screw in the top screws, then the bottom screws.
Fold the stand up and finish tightening the bottom screws if you couldn’t reach them before.
Done! The stand adjusts by pulling the lever at the back.
This stand has such a wide range
Even this far up it’s pretty stable though.
Next take your combo cable
and plug the end with two pieces into the side of the tablet.
Take the three piece part and plug the power cable into the round end.
For the last step, plug the two remaining ends into your computer and plug the power in.
Press the power button on the side of the tablet
and you’re ready to go.
You may need to charge your pen.
Uninstall any existing tablet software
you have and unzip and install the driver.
Once you’ve installed, restart your computer.
Turn your tablet on.
Press the Auto button until the menu is gone.
The tablet software doesn’t start up automatically, so you need to to right
click the tablet icon and Run As Administrator.
Do this a second time to get into the controls.
Under Press Keys you can set the shortcuts for your ten buttons.
Under Stylus Pen
you can change how sensitive your pen is.
You may program the two buttons on your pen on this screen as well.
I didn’t see artists
Go to your desktop
on your main monitor, right click, Display Settings.
Choose your tablet monitor.
In my case it’s 1.
Notice how the settings are upscaled to 150%.
Change the scale to 100%.
Close this and run the tablet again.
Go to Work Area.
Use the dropdown at the top to select your tablet monitor.
If you are left handed, check this 180 radio button.
Now everybody click Monitor Calibration.
Take your pen and press the red dots on the screen.
Then your pen will work.
I swear there’s always one weird thing with setting tablets up and it’s different for each one.
Press the Menu button to enter an option.
Press the Auto button to go back one step.
The PD1560 has a lot of options, which is nice.
Other than that
the default colors were rather good.
You’ll notice that the side-to-side viewing angle for the tablet isn’t as good as my monitor.
The colors change a lot
when you turn the tablet, versus a high quality monitor there’s not much change.
The only reason this would be important is if you plan to mount this tiny tablet on a monitor arm.
The tablet screen needs to be facing you for true color.
The other screen tablet
I’ve personally tried that I recommend you look into is the Huion Kamvas GT-191.
It is more expensive, slightly
Here’s the quality ranking for the tablets
I’ve used as of this video.

thank you for choosing this little little lion thing
if this will focus sorry
my camera is still broken
I never really had a tablet pen
what there's a weird actually love it
let me let me open a swimming
open this
Wow it's open with magic
who woulda guessed
okay so this is like a oh this is a clicker
Oh what I mean
I know I know what these buttons do
why whoa
I guess I have to figure out what this is
I had to charge it and I'm guessing with this one
I don't so which is mega plus with me because I hate charging things and then right here
good guy this is like a bag of like little nips
I don't know what this metal ring is for
I I can't review cords man
I mean it's just a regular cord
it looks like it's really long too
that's what I really liked about my last seen on tablet the cord was really long so
I didn't have to worry about it putting it too close to my laptop with my current tablet
the cord is really short as you can see
I probably should read it
okay so here is the actual tablet itself so tiny and so cute
I love it so brushes okay
so it's pretty
it's really really tiny and small
I could pick it up in my head and I can't wait to use this for four things
let's just enjoy this speedpaint featuring some miku fan art that I actually drew
what the tablet that
the unboxing of the package was really nice and it looked perfect
who never it came in the mail and I was really excited whenever I got it
I absolutely enjoy drawing with it
I was fairly surprised that throughout the entire time drawing
I didn't have to worry about all of these buttons and what they do so it was very nice
I'm a very minimalistic person
that are on the go
it is a smaller tablet
I'm not really into that kind of lifestyle now
but not really enough for me to really get flustered and angry about
I just wished that it would
it's not really that big of a deal that's just me being whiny
I'm trying not to repeat myself because I really do
love this tablet
I've already talked about why I loved it
I just it's it's just been such a long time
since a small tablet it was has such a good quality
so if you're if you're starting out in art and you're buying this tablet
I envy you
I wish I had this whenever I first started out
we're not talking about my poor decisions around pets
I highly recommend this tablet
I am 100% gonna recommend this one and I'm not just saying that because huion sent me this
this is 100% my own opinion
I really like this tablet and I really wish I got
now you know what this toilet is capable of that
I really like this tablet so I'm just gonna stop rambling
that is my review
I will see you later again
thank you here
we on for sending me this tablet
I absolutely love it and I'll be back next week with a big announcement and yeah bye either you
Welcome to something a little bit different.
We are reviewing the XP-PEN Artist
15.6 tablet today.
that has a few extra bells and whistles.
that are often double the price, sometimes pushing into the thousands.
It’s worth noting that unlike the pro
here, so you have about as much as control over your work as you could ask for.
After a few minutes of playing around, I was able to draw comfortably with almost no issues.
The pen itself comes with a nice little stand, and requires no batteries.
On the subject of customisable buttons, there are six on offer on the tablet itself.
Within the software, you can set these globally or on a program-to-program basis.
if you’ve set up some custom commands that would otherwise be unusable.
But that’s about it
as far as features and thoughts go, so let’s quickly recap with some pros and cons:
For more details on specs and pricing in your region, feel free to check out the description.
Thanks for listening, and I will see you next time.
hello this is a very quick look at the
Alcatel Pixy 3 tablet
this is the 10.1 inch version and it just says pixie on the back around the side
you've got the screen lock volume and memory card slots and you will need a memory card
I found the memory
this was running
this actually turns the tablet almost into a a little console
Alcatel are really good at producing nice hardware for a low price and the pixie
3 tablet is no exception
I hope you found this short review so thanks for watching
I collect peripherals for many different systems
I got the you draw game tablet for the Nintendo mate is a beginner's computer art tablet of sorts
it's like my first
Wacom Hey well I come for the Wii
that sounds bad out of the box
the system itself is well designed and quite sturdy
the tip of the stylus acts as a button itself
and there's a long one to the side
oh you're got the wheel come down like that
don't know what comes we it's we and finally there's an area to put the
Wiimote into some future games
we'll work off of the balance of the internal sensors and I also like the size of it
it's small and can tuck away very nicely
it's not like other game peripherals
it's not bad at all so let's look at the game menus and see how this thing works no we got
Stacey's stylus eyes
Stein stylists steel steel scissors
there's the tutorial area with several bits of information on basic controls
then there's the different sections that you will be using more than others paint
there's the gallery area where all of your saved artwork is kept
are you kidding me
nobody can finish a piece of artwork on this thing in 30 minute
wait a second
they mean 30 minutes of actual drawing okay
I see see every time you make a line
it counts towards your 30 minutes fractions of seconds
so you really do have plenty of time to draw something but you can only draw so much
yes you can draw and edit from all the way back to when you first started well okay
say what's that son
oh come on pop
it's a knight with a sword in a castle and a key and a dragon
geez dad use your imagination haha
that's my boy also
there isn't a lot of tutorial on how to actually use the system
I mean sure
it gives an explanation of tools in the manual
and then how to do something
but there's no practical application that walks you through it
I made quite a few mistakes until I learned how to shade correctly
then teaching them how to use it is real essential
I mean even Art Academy for the DS had tutorials on how to use a program
now it's not a sensor per se
it's a pressure button
if you want to use that bit of a program
this might just be the model that I used but it was an inconvenience another complaint
is that it's not made from left-handed people
it's a genuine one now
get on it
and please remember
this is a kid's toy
it's not a professional tool by any stretch of the imagination
any but then again it wasn't made to be it was made to be a game
it was made for kids from the get-go and that's just what it is as an artistic training device
look ma no mess all in all
it's a nice game and a nice peripheral
I don't see much happening with the upcoming games like pictionary
who know nothing of the you draw program of the positives
there's a 30-minute time limit for your artwork
there's no tutorial on how to use some of the more interesting devices
the target audience here is going to be kids and artists sports fanatics
unless you're an artist
don't get this game
I just want to say I think this is a great idea
but there's so much more room for expansion
Nintendo y-component n-no I think I will draw it Chuck
oh my oh
it's gonna make you gawk now that doesn't work
I'm sorry
the kneepad 3 is the latest tablet from the Chinese company
Xiaomi it costs right around $300 in rifles Apple's iPad Mini in build quality and specifications
display are relatively thin as well
there's enough room to grip the tablet with your thumb but not too much more
the display itself is very crisp
it has good contrast and viewing angles the only concern
I have with it
is the display size itself
the smartphone in my pocket measures in at 6 point 2 inches
the software is very appealing out of the box
the meet pad 3 is running
Android 7 new --get which is a must for an Android tablet
multitasking is not available with this version of me
UI I read a report that said 'my UI 9.0
will be coming to this device in
there's no excuse why multitasking isn't available here out of the box with Android 7.0
it's just such a tease but what that said there are some other features
you can do this on other
it's reminiscent of a full-fledged laptop or a desktop
I think it's pretty neat
it's being powered by a mediatek mt6752
the biggest con is the lack of roms got support
mediatek processors equals 4
I found it to reform on par with the front facing sensors
found in many flagships out there under the hood
we have a 6600 milliamp hour battery
that should provide an average around 8 hours of screen on time
let's need to see however is that the battery is larger than the previous me pad
give or take you get a fast
Android tablet with a good screen and amazing build quality
the biggest problem I have with it
is it's awkward sighs
I mean I mentioned that earlier
if you are at all interested links will be down below as always
I'm Billy HT from phone Doug comm
I hope you enjoyed this video
thank you for watching and I will see you right back here in the next one see ya
there is 150 dollars there
I can't even get half of an iPad for what I can get an entire
Iconia 110 for okay
so let's get this disclaimer out of the way right now
acer is not paying me to make the video
i don't get to keep the tablet
I happen to like Acer products
I personally own the Acer Tab 8 tablet
I happen to be a big fan of tablets especially large tablets
that's why I bought an iPad originally because of the nine point seven inch display
I'm not much for the smaller ones
what do I you use tablets for let me show you something this is how I used to consume content
remember all these
I watched movies on this thing
here's the thing
I'm getting 32
gigs for 149 bucks
yeah come you 110
let's do business in the bathroom
hey there Konya 110 helps me
keep from being bored on the treadmill
that's important guys
you want to stay fit for the ladies
let's do something funny
let's make a viral video feed
you is so not one of the things
I love about a tablet including the Acer
Iconia 110 is
let's take it whether you throw in the car and off you go
so we have a 10.1 inch 1280 by 800
IPS display on here LED and which makes it HD
it's not 1080p but still is quite good for watching movies
social media email
reading is just fine
the color is beautiful on its colour
reproduction is really awesome on their comes with
Android lollipop 5.1 pre-installed
okay it's going to come with the Iconia suite which will pull that up here
it gives you easy note
easy setup easy wakeup easy gadget easy tracking on there as well as you
okay to sum up why
I think this is a good value for the money it comes from
Acer Acer is a well-known reputable company not an unknown from some company
you never heard of number two it comes with a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core CPU
it comes with a very colorful bright
IPS display it is HD
it's not 1080p
but it's still very very good for doing everything we talked about in
this video comes with bluetooth 4.0 wireless a B G and n Wi-Fi on it
it comes with 32
gigs of flash storage and a micro SD card slot
eight five megapixel rear camera and a two megapixel front-facing camera
you're getting a lot for your money
runs comes with
Android lollipop installed very snappy very responsive so for a hundred and fifty dollars MSRP
I don't think you're going to go wrong with this tablet
hi this is teal from
Park Blocks calm today
I'm going to show you this wireless tablet that is made by weon
they sent me this unit for review purposes
so that's the disclaimer
so let's take a look at the tablet itself
this is the packaging box by the way
the working area of the tablet is actually thirteen
point eight inches by eight point six
so this is a very big tablet
let's open this up and show you
thank you cut the manual
we have the pen the pen holder and some extra lips so the extra nibs are hidden in the pen holder
there are four extra nibs and there's this nib remover
in addition to all this stuff it also comes with some cables
this is a wireless pan that is powered by a battery inside
you just need to plug it in and use it at the same time
the other cable that is provided is the charging cable for the tablet
this is a wireless tablet and this is also powered by battery
the battery is also non removable
life is quite good actually
let's take a closer look at that tablet on the top left
we have the power switch and below that our signal lights
let me turn this on
there's one signal light for the wireless connection so once you turn it on
this will turn blue the top line here
the battery is running low
they are preset
as for the surface of the tablet
I'm feeling it it's the same when I'm drawing on the Wacom tablet or the real tablet
the texture feels exactly the same also when you take note of the size of this tablet versus the
Wacom tablet this way on tablet is almost 2 times the size of this
Wacom tablet and this is a medium sized Wacom tablet
I would put my driver files onto these thumb drive so if I want to bring this tablet to my office
I can install the drivers from this time drivers
this is quite convenient and you have a very convenient place to store it as well
just at the corner of this tablet
alright let's talk about using the tablet on their
let me show you how to do that
just click on this advanced setting button
and in this panel you can see the twelve buttons here
you can turn them off as well using these two buttons here
if you are left-handed you can check this button here
that's all there is to customizing the pen and tablet
let me open
Photoshop to do a drawing demonstration create a new file and Lochte is and use the brush
so let me show you the light touch first with their pen on the tablet so this is quite sensitive
I'm barely putting the nib on their surface of the tablet
and if you want it to be thick you can just press down hard and the performance is very smooth
that's absolutely no lag at all
the curves are very smooth as well
no jagged lines or anything on
Mac os10 I find a drawing experience to be flawless
the lines come out exactly the way
I want them to be
there's no glitch or anything on the Mac OS so let me switch over to the windows now now
I'm using the Microsoft Surface pro 4
this is a tablet and it comes with its own stylus after
I install the free own drivers
I find that the pressure sensitivity on the Microsoft Surface pen stopped working
Pro fall as mentioned earlier
this is actually a thumb
drive with eight gigs of storage
that's why when
I plugged it in windows
open up this folder to show me
what's inside the thumb drive
I'm just going to minimize that now
I'm going to open photoshop
it works perfectly now
I did find some glitch
these are actually two separate lines
I stopped drawing here
sometimes it doesn't so it's quite frustrating
I recommend you install this software called lazy Nezumi Pro
this comes with a trial version
let me close this fall and open a new file so now
I've switched on lazy Nezumi Pro to draw the same thing again
I'm going to draw several lines
this is the first line
I stopped and the second line and the third line and let me move
then you don't have to buy this because other applications
they actually work quite well
drawing performance with this tablet is very smooth
there is almost no lack and pressure sensitivity works very well
the only downside to this tablet is the driver compatibility with Photoshop
I have tried this with Photoshop
cs5 cs6 on windows 7 and 10 all of them
Nezumi Pro
I don't have any problems with Mac OS overall
I will say this is a very good tablet
it works the buttons here works
the pen works very well too
and it's very convenient because it's wireless so yeah it's a good tablet
that's all for my video review today
if you have any questions feel free to post them in the comment section below
I will also post links to all the software that I talked about in the video description
so you can go and download them and try them
yeah thanks for watching
see you in the next video and remember to subscribe to my youtube channel for more
our product reviews you
this is Lisa from mobile tech review
multi-touch display running at 1280 by 800 resolution making it also the highest resolution
Android tablet currently on the market
you can see honeycomb looks quite a bit different than standard Android
we're to take a look at that in a minute
after we do the hardware tour you see
top here
light sensor down on the bottom and then here we have a whole lot of little ports
we have the standard micro USB port and micro HDMI port
there's a sensor for a dock connector over here
this is your charging hole right here and that's the microphone
this is a nice metal chassis and it's got a soft touch finish and do think soft touch finish great
it's not going to pick up fingerprints well as you can see
it's gotten a lot of fingerprints already
looks nice and feels nice other than the fingerprint nation
this part is plastic up here because there are antennas underneath and then
I want to block wireless reception
you have dual speakers here at stereo speakers
here's your five megapixel autofocus main camera
they can shoot 720p video quite good video in fact dual LED flash
this is your power button right here
which feels really good when you're holding their device it's kind of natural your hands
are there if you want to just hit the power button you can do so up top
here's your 3.5
millimeter headphone jack
and under this door
and you'll have to send that back to
Motorola there's no charge
so you're not going to be running out of space anytime soon you can see
it's quite a thin device or a tablet feels nice
feels like it's all about over here for a size comparison
here's the 7 inch
Samsung Galaxy Tab Android OS
Froyo tablet
you can see obviously the Motorola Xoom is a lot bigger a lot more screen real estate
and obviously you're ain't going to be bitten the Motorola Xoom in your pocket wears large pockets
you might be able to fit the Galaxy
Taman now here we have it next to the iPad
you can see they're about the same length
iPad is wider though and in terms of weight
they're about the same at each one point
we'll show you in a minute
and this case that's 39 bucks
it's kind of neat case
it's not leather
it doesn't add bulk
this makes a lot of sense if you're gonna use the neurons accessory bluetooth keyboard
this also $70 in fact
this is the same one that's bundled with the Atrix $189 dhoklas keyboard plus mouse
and it works
just fine and you can set it up
that said the on-screen keyboard is so good
but it's nice to have that option
this has a dual core
that we showed you
that's not yet enabled
hopefully it will be soon via a software
update that's a bit weird it's running android
Talk video chatting and we test
so it's free and it works with
ok let's take a look
this is the new honeycomb interface right here
you can still put shortcuts to people contacts and applications and stuff like that here
this does not make phone calls however over the cellular network
so you won't be using over cellular
of course you can do white calling and video chat and all that kind of thing
we've got a million heavyweight applications running in the background
so it gives you a panoramic view of all of your home screens over here
and here's your selection
you can choose widgets app shortcuts wallpapers and others stuffing
I want to have my email inbox widget so I just take that and I pick an email account well
I'm at it and that's done when you're done just hit the home button gone
are the hardware buttons now
you have everything
there's a software control here
this is the back button and keyboard
minimize this is your home button to bring you back to the home screen
this is your multitasking button
here you can see
we have a lot of apps actually running right now
Danny tap here
you've got your status here
I got my tweet caster running and telling me other
some applications installed the music player running in the background
I can just tap on that to start it again
playing and here
we have just your time wi-fi's battery status
they're also tapped over here
you get more stuffing switch to airplane mode
you can look for system updates there you can see is running
Android 3 you go back home again now
and this is a side-scrolling
Motorola verizon really haven't loaded this with any applications in them
many of these are actually my own that
I put on here you do get of course Google Marketplace Google Books
the web kit base web browsers are really awesome
they're quite small surprisingly for
Big Town
you can do that before
you're playing find out what the movies are
and we'll just play transformers
we're gonna take a look at the YouTube player which is pretty awesome
we've got the main YouTube interface first
so you've got your wallet
TVs look here for all sorts of videos also very responsive pick something
so you can scroll through there other videos here and related videos plays in the window there
no problem full screen so this is this is YouTube player this is YouTube mobile
this is not Flash 10.1 10.2
rather and it looks really good on release date there is no Flash Player 10.2
ready yet
I would say given how the Motorola Atrix with a dual core Tegra 2 perform
it should play those videos well
Google Books so here
you've got fancy pagesturning animations just like apples
I booked page slider here
you can also jump to chapters depending on the book its format and you can do things like change
the brightness set the day/night theme text size line height oddly
this can make a very nice ebook reader
of course there is screen glare
that's one thing for those of you prefer ink
then we're going to take a look at the web browser which as you can see here supports page
we've got our own website going right here
it supports pinch zooming
this is the following gadget site
which as you all know is very heavy
there's no problem with that
and you can
set your home page
pop-ups yes or no
now you have that so clearly
it's a beautiful browsing experience
and let's take a look at another page
we've got the phone
the art time tom page
and here's a video when we have it a trauma most of these been mobilized in html5
so it's gonna play right in a YouTube player New York
Times front page videos tend to not be very high quality though so
I'm not sure you expect much from this
what's actually looking quite nice
there you go inline video the New York Times web page in the YouTube mobile player
so here we are in Google Maps
and obviously this is bigger than most portable navigation
thanks we're gonna look at movie studio
the movie the project and drop more movies in here to join them together
I suppose is better than nothing
that's movie studio so yes
Angry Birds runs fine
we'll show it to you very large birds under ten display so yes
Angry Birds good news is here obviously runs perfectly in fills the screen next
you can filter by politics and this is mostly about live video and we are doing this over
I'm going to take a look the 3d game Dungeon Defenders
that's included with the tablet
this really makes use of the Nvidia graphics and dual-core processor
I think it will look at one more third-party application here movies is Flixster
but this is looking pretty good so it's nice to see that third party folks are getting their apps
ready really quickly for the tablet here
of course it says the Android Market
it's not quite the look that you're used to
it's it's much better in fact so you see right here
these scroll independently if you want to search you
don't here and here you can see the keyboard then
I can actually type two-handed as if I were touch typing very nice
our we're going to show you that by using the Atrix ism HDMI cable
for some reason
this doesn't ship with one
we're just going to plug this guy right into our HDTV and give it a test alright now
I've hooked up the Motorola Xoom to our HDTV over here and we've used a HDMI 2 mini HDMI cable
the one actually that came with the Atrix for some reason
there isn't one in the box with this and as you can see we'll just wake that back up again there
we have our Android desktop looking mighty fine on a very large screen TV
and now we'll check out you do
$5.99 making it
Tegra 2 processor which is very fast
this is just a joy to use
it's so quick and responsive
I'm Lisa from mobile tech review
so about two months ago the kind folks over at galwan were like we give you tablet
you give us review and i was like give me
wow this is really big
um can i have some help please
so yeah the company
gaomon sent me their 15.6 inch drawing monitor in exchange for a review
and um here it is
i'll be doing a fun
also if you're interested in buying the tablet i will leave a link below
let's just get into the video so today is sunday october 11th and we received this package on
i believe wednesday so it's been sitting in our garage for a few days
um but as you can see
i don't think we need any of these boxes now
so here's the box and they have this nice little illustration on the front
wow i don't know it's like you feel that
actually you can't feel it
i think this is probably here for um to like uh just soften it like kind of for some padding
i assume so
actually let me open up this case this
this case feels pretty nice
oh and it also has the gaomon logo
i don't know if you can see that and yeah it's just a little case it's orange inside
i'm just gonna move this traveling case away so we can look at
what else is inside of this box
obviously right here we have the actual drawing tablet
it is pretty big
this is a 15 inch
um drawing tablet
yeah wow this is really big and it's probably really nice drawn
so let's see if i can open this up
okay let's pull the drawing tablet um they have this dial wheel
wow pretty cool oh and also as you can see they have um 10 expressions
that's a lot of express keys
this is actually a very small stand
um when you compare it to the size of the tablet it's actually pretty small
um let's open it up
all right
let's see what else comes in here
um all right so obviously here we got the stylus or the tablet
um let's open it up and see how it looks and feels too
oh it
just kind of peels open
i think the stylus are pretty durable
so wow okay that i actually really like how this the stylus feels
it feels really nice and light settling
now let's get into the review
starting with the basics this is a 15.6 inch drawing monitor with a fully laminated hd screen
it has a battery free
i'm gonna pretend i know what that means
this tablet comes with a pre-installed
matte screen protector
this tablet is 15.6 inches
this mainly happens when i'm using a really big brush on fire alpaca
hey folks how we all doing today
i hope you're cool
it's kind of winding down
and i looked at how much they are
and they're like 350 to 650 dollars
somewhere in that pool park
let's face it um also
nothing too hardcore
so i don't need this sort of hardcore monster and i wasn't sure what was out there
i won't really need or use
i've got no idea so i did panic for a second but i got in touch with the team
i explained this and they were like it's fine river
we like you
we like your style and we just want an honest candid review
so that's what i'm gonna do
i want something that feels like
it's not going to fall apart at any moment
you know budget's good but i don't want you know completely not to trash
i want it to feel good
i want the picture to be clear
let's run through some of the specifications and delve a little bit deeper into a semi unboxing
okay so inside the box
um a little bit grubby there on the side
there's a dual camera and look
i've saved this moment
you just press the button
connecting to my wi-fi took a couple of minutes or less and actually the look and feel instantly
reminded me of my old google chrome laptop that i had a few years ago
it's got that center home button in the middle
it's quite handy
it's r i
lots of people saying they resolved the issue with little bluetooth speakers
so if the sound begins to bug me i'll just plug some of those in
but i have to say it doesn't bug me
it is a little tinny
it doesn't bother me
i quite like tinny
sometimes that must be weird but uh it's fine the swiping and scrolling as
what sort of pressure to apply
there was no difference so it was just a kind of lighting thing here on the camera
obviously my ipad feels a bit more luxe
it's got that feeling of a certain sheen and it costs a lot more but to be quite honest with you
i've actually ended up preferring the feel of this
it feels robust
it doesn't feel too delicate
the edges aren't too curved and too rounded
it's just right the color
reproduction seems perfectly faithful to my eye
it's not the highest resolution in the world but in a way that works to its benefit
because there's less pixels for it to deal with so it's apples and oranges really basically
it's decent quality for low end specs and a very low price
so now i'm going to run off the specs for all of you
that understand all those big words okay
there's a micro usb port for charging and one of its most popular features is a micro hdmi port
so you can connect it to a monitor for direct video output
it's very useful it's android 9.0
pi enhances performance and reduces ads
giving you a more customized experience the body of the tablet is made of black metal
so it's substantial
i'm going to be honest with you
uh the rear camera
the 8 megapixel is it's adequate
you can store tons of photos
ebooks songs and movies and also actually
this is a great plus point here
you can quickly get answers
take calls play a song
check the temperature control smart devices
scratch your ass okay
maybe not that last one but you know it does a lot
and and with that micro hdmi port
it also features a 5v2a micro usb power adapter now
i have heard different reports
that was extremely simple
that sparkling away
come on ah bingo
let's have a scroll through things
they've been saying on amazon
the top reviews good and bad
i charge it that night and it wouldn't turn on again
it never showed that it was charging and it wouldn't do anything after that first day
i contacted amazon
customer service
they immediately shipped out a replacement
so far we've had no problems with the replacement amazon
customer service was excellent
i bought this one
is that it states that it comes with hdmi that i want to connect to my tv
i use it all day and it worked very well
needless to say right now i like it and would recommend it to anyone who wants a tablet
it's a great product for the price
very good verified purchase
okay so that's five stars
another five star verified purchase
here great value hits all the marks
i needed a tablet to read emails
read pdfs and books watch videos and do some like internet browsing from time to time
sounds a bit like me
this device fit the bill perfectly
i used it heavily ever since i received it
she received it
in my opinion
it should be priced less than what the purchase price was
when i bought it that being said on with my review the tablet feels well built
i did buy a case and screen protector and immediately use them
youtube runs on it with no lag as does clash of clans game from google play store
does that mean anything to you guys
it doesn't do me
the game does not look as crisp clear and colorful as it does on my phone which is a samsung
i could find no setting to resolve the issues
with color and clarity speakers leave a lot to be desired
okay well lisa sounds like
she's got a similar attitude to me and she's given a generous uh four-star rating as well
so she said it should be priced less but that was in april 2019
so it's probably gone down in price since then i think roger i do not recommend this tablet
but he's given it four stars
he sent emails to tablet express support
didn't hear from them ended up contacting amazon support
explain the situation
they wanted to send a replacement tablet but he had already been refunded
eventually he received the tablet has used it on a daily basis for two weeks
hasn't had any problems quite satisfied
finally i'll add that my contact with dragon touch customer support
jack q chan this time around was exceptional
okay so a few blips there
nice tablet for watch
tv tablet's a good price
so i bought it for my two-year-old's daughter
she used it to watch tv
two-year-old guys don't buy tablets for two-year-olds give them a book
she used it to watch tv
it has clear picture and nice
i put the tablet in ipad to case the width a little big but does not affect use the battery
life almost does my ipad 2.
so can you see
she doesn't write very well because she doesn't read many books
another glowing five-star report from stephen gilroy
i ordered this just before it was released
so it might be different
more wi-fi connects via five gigahertz
just fine attached a screenshot of a third-party device hardware info app
the sound from the speakers is very good for this price range
okay so perhaps i was just judging it next to my ipad which was probably a bit unfair
replugs didn't fix so they were just literally the first top reviews that came up
you can go and have a look for yourself to verify that but they seem pretty good
don't they guys i'm pretty fair
so what were my final thoughts about the dragon touch k10 notepad
you know if i'd spent 500 on it then no i wouldn't be happy because you know
the camera is not absolutely amazing
it doesn't move with great speed and agility but for 99 dollars
it does what i need to do
you have to kind of get used to it being a little bit slower than high spec models
but that's why they charge
it's you know what it's like guys a few years ago
multiple windows open
you need to be constantly gaming you know
you're a heavy gamer
something like that
don't buy this
this isn't going to be for you
you're just going to find it frustrating
so let's not pretend that it's going to work for you
the sound is not superb
no problem i'm just jumping in here to mention that
i did play around with the video camera capabilities on the front and the rear
they're not good
they're not good
i mean they capture obviously sound and vision but not to any kind of quality degree
i do all of that on my phone so for me
i don't need it
i know that for myself personally
i'm not doing that but we're all different
we've all got different expectations different needs
how i make my videos disclaimer
i am not a professional at this field whatsoever
i'm just trying to do a tutorial on how i make my videos my own style
it's basically like timelines or like thumbnails
on how the animation is gonna look
roughly yes i know
media bang paint is not an animation program
but i try to work with it
and why don't you try
learning an animation program is stupid
yeah no i'm too lazy
of course you gotta add your audio in this video
i'm gonna do two time by jack
stauber canvas size that i use is 1920 by 1080 pixels
it's basically like the standard youtube size
it's completely up to you if you want to
color or shade your animation
i use sony vegas pro 13 as it is very simple and easy to use
i'll probably upload the whole thing soon once i finish it okay
time for the tablet review xp pen deco mini 7 wireless
here's a quick unboxing video
it looks cute
it's very small
honestly what i like about this tablet is it's very portable
not only it can be for wireless but the size of it is very small too
so uh using this tablet for a while
paint isn't an animation program
guess what card animator 4 is wait
follow me on instagram
because that's probably where i'll be dming you and lastly follow at xp and aliexpress on facebook
but if you're from the philippines you can follow at experiment page
it's the cartoon animator 4.
here you can see me
considering its price
this was pretty worth it
and that's it
and i'll answer them
probably thank you and goodbye you
today have a very highly requested video
which is where
I'm gonna supply some links to old Satori graphics videos that are based around
Wacom tablets as well as give you guys the rundown on
and you're even going to see a few scuffs on my
Wacom tablet but right off the bat
I'm gonna say that the Wacom splash
one tablet is one of the most basic models of any
Wacom tablet out there but for me
that's just fine
Wacom splash one
tablet is ideal because it bridges the gap between developing logo designs on paper
and then we're finding them digitally in the daily straighter
it's also really handy for digital hand lettering
Wacom splash one tablet
however if you're like me and use a laptop a new
I found that when I draw with the Wacom splash one table
1 table is very smooth
indeed there's a button in the
I find so in closing
I find this
Wacom splash one tablet
I said this tablet isn't too advanced and it's not too intricate but it does the job it's heavy
GT as you can see
Wacom one splash table
design your future today peace
hi today
H 10 H 610 Pro v2 friend of mine mentioned that she has this 610
Pro like the one before this one
she's had it for a while and she really loves it so yeah
let's let's open the box
oh it smells good
thank you for choosing chu-young warranty stuff
there's the pad itself
mmm it's beautiful cool
it's got all these little buttons
I think this is a drawing glove
dad helico this
um this is weird yeah
um this here is a gift
you all shouldn't have really
I don't know what those are hmm I guess we'll find out see the pen
here's the pin lovely is this
I guess these are extra nibs cool
all right and pen goes like that eat
looks like it uses a mini
I'm looking forward to this
this here is a drawing that
I found in an old sketchbook I was flipping through a little while ago
I just found it and it was unfinished and it just looked good to me
maybe enhance the color and shadow of these cords
a bit but yeah
I'm just trying to put them on a blank page at this point
Photoshop like there are five different ways to do this
I'm sure and probably all of them are easier than what I'm doing
I had to start over again because Photoshop just completely froze on me
I think that was part of the problem
I just had some some wonky computer issues and stuff
running in the background and a nice refresh was was a good way of fixing that
anyway this pad here
I guess we're doing a review video
so um yeah this
Huey on tablets nice
it's it's responsive the pen is nice its Wireless doesn't need to be charged or anything
it just works magically
I think it has eight thousand something different pressure points
it's fantastic granted
this is a really simple drawing
I get the hype
there's one other one
Groot Groot brushes
I bought a big brush
pack from them pretty affordable
I think it was like six hundred different brushes or something and it was like $30
I don't know if that still exists
have a good week
welcome everyone
I'm gonna be doing this unboxing today of this
Ematic ewt 826 BK
there is an 8 inch screen with 1280 by 800 resolution it does have an EPS screen IPS
so that's a very promising item that I look for because screen
quality can be quite important
let's see it has a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core Atom processor
I believe it's Z 37:35
there is only one gigabyte of memory which is quite limiting for a Windows tablet
so we're gonna see how that works out
32 gigabytes of flash memory
I'm not too concerned about that
that's a standard amount for these type of devices does have front and back cameras
there is a micro
SD card slot USB and Bluetooth
so you can actually dock this tablet you can see
oh yes so
this keyboard does not need any type of batteries or any type of power supply
this is important because if you used some of these
so this is interesting so
the screen quality is pretty good
why getting the task manager up and showing you folks its performance figures
this is in fact an intel atom z3580 gigahertz
it does go into turbo mode up to 1.6 gigahertz so it will do that dynamically
it is a dual core system
so when you get the system do expect to have
Windows do its update and tie up
Windows does its updates
it needs to space so don't put too many applications on
there does have a 32
what's most of the
it supports up to 32 gigabyte s microSD card however
I did plug in a 128 gigabyte Samsung evil SDXC and it recognized it just fine
there was no problem with it whatsoever
it was really fast and that will definitely be your best option
if you're going to be looking at expandable storage for this unit what
I'm gonna do now is load up Google Earth which I downloaded last night
gigahertz only band so it does not support 5 gigahertz so the zoom is pretty good
I don't have any problems with too much lag here
that's not bad at all
actually this is very usable okay next
I noticed by typing on this last night
if you go full on pushing down in the middle it seems to be okay
what about battery life well
I'm currently at 27% battery life and it's showing about of hours 16 minutes
I don't really know exactly what the total battery life is gonna be like
the brightness is great by the way
I haven't had any problems with it
don't expect stellar quality
remember folks
if you need it you got it okay as far as the web browser goes
I got a YouTube
this is one of my videos here and I'll try to play back part of this
let me just kind of jump around a little bit here so we can see some spinning
it is a little bit slower than you know
it doesn't excel very well in web browsing per se because generally if when
I like to get a tablet with good web browsing capabilities
I like to have that paired with good battery life
and this doesn't seem to provide that there are better options out there but this is a
it worked perfectly fine
there was no problem whatsoever overall do
I think this tablet is worth it it was 56 dollars so I would say yeah
it's definitely worth the 56 dollars for my purposes at least because like
I said I did have
and how does that compare to this unit
I hope you'll find this review to be informative for you
if so subscribe to my channel and you can receive some future review updates as well thank you
hello everyone it's me again and today
let's get into the unboxing when you open the box
you're fated with a big beautiful tablet monitor covered neatly in a protective sheet
so here we have the power adapter which comes along with multiple regional power plugs
it gave me all of them but on the ouya website you can choose a specific one
I bought it from Amazon so I have plugs from everywhere
so that's cool
here's a little baggie filled with things
I'm gonna go play melee
and here's the stand wrapped all snug in a thin foam sheet
it also came with an extra pen as a gift
wow how do they know that
I constantly lose my tablet pen specific
looks like mini
HDMI USB and then power plug on one end and then a baked HDMI on the other end
Here I am forcing my boyfriend to do everything for me
the stand is pretty cool
it's like magnetized so you can set it to like different heights
I like mine high because I'm pretty short and I can't look over my desk without
I'm super hurting my back
here's some saying that it's a nice sleek material and it's also very sturdy
here's the late
there's like a scroll
II kind of touch screen thing
so drawing on this tablet was pretty nice
Photoshop and I didn't have any problems with the driver
this tablet works as a second monitor instead of like a like tablet
at a time
it feels really cool
the pen is actually really light and nice
it doesn't come with a pen
stand or anything though so what
my posture is really bad
which isn't the best is that the calibration is not always going to be perfectly accurate
it feels kind of awkward
being a second monitor it is not a touchscreen
it only works with the pen stylus so just keep that in mind
I noticed that was kind of wonky when I when I started drawing with it
was that the middle button
that's that is touch for your finger that Scrolls and zooms is very choppy
the buttons on the side of the tablet and around the tablet are very a very nice smooth material
it's very comfortable
I kind of wish that's a pen which is kind of like a hard plastic
was the same kind of like velvety material that the rest of it is color
quality on the tablet is phenomenal
it looks really beautiful and bright and vivid
I don't see any errors in that
the quality is also phenomenal
it's very crisp
it feels really really natural drawing on it also one thing
I have to mention
is that the screen
quality is really nice like the physical quality
it's a matte screen and there's no glare and it's really really nice so in general
I recommend this tablet to anybody who is wanting a cheaper screen tablet
although you're sacrificing the fact that it isn't a touchscreen
it's really comfortable and it's definitely a nice start one thing
I will add is I kind of wish that the stand went slightly higher right now
I have to kind of put a book behind it
I'd like to throw in is that I really do wish that
you know when you when you draw something you tilt the pen it changes its shape
I definitely recommend this once
it's not a super beginner tablet though
I always suggest starting digital art on graphic tablet before you go on to a screen tablet
Huyen keeps impressing me with a lot of these products and I'm really happy to do reviews for them
I hope that you guys like this
I'm going to leave the Amazon and liuyan link in the description
thank you all for watching and I'll see you in the next video bye
