we have a few more specs to talk about
like i said has three gigs of ram
there's not a whole lot of you know customizing or options
it's a very good quality tablet basic android build
so that's kind of neat it does auto rotate
because of that octa-core processor it is really fast it does
i'm just going to click on this video here
i just gotta click on the right spot there there we go go back
hit the home button and go launch another app like chrome inside chrome
let's go to this little car page right here
you can kind of see how fast the internet loads on this
we'll be able to kind of see that right
see if we have anything that pops open there get a little book
it said there we go and then we'll go to a different program
see how this loads go to google maps
the other thing to talk about would be the camera
the um the back camera is i would say decent quality
it's a decent quality camera you know it's definitely nothing to write home about
i just have to hit the right buttons there
we go and we can take a picture this way too
i have on youtube and rate comment and subscribe thanks
my name is fi and welcome back to the channel
i just want to say thank you to everyone
so we are going to start with unboxing so we have the tablet itself
which is you can claim one year warranty
you can look on the detailed description on the screen
m106k pro can be used on windows mac and android one of the reason
so you won't be needing a keyboard anymore when you're drawing or animating
let's look at the pen so the pen is very light
it doesn't have a problem for me to to draw and everything is smooth
it is the drawing that i made with a m106k pro by gomon
i was just like focused on my drawing and coloring and stuff
nothing really bothered me so like i think
check the links below as for my next animation
and i'll see you in the next one see ya you
olds but you can get it for 119 years
obviously at this price point everything is plastic but I was quite quite surprised
US dollars I kind of expect 16 gigabytes
but that's not what we are getting here
you can store music movies and so on on my grade
they're two cameras with a resolution of 5 and 2 megapixels
end devices of all the performance is pretty good
this is not a gaming tablet not because of the performance
I got around 350 points and in the mighty quadtest
Android 6.0 marshmallow has been out for why now but Samsung still ships
N word and that's pre-installed on it by when you get it
it's not as overloaded as it used to be
Samsung did not pre install a lot of apps on the Galaxy
I don't like it but other features that we like that
I like in touch with like the multi window feature and that still included
they're only some from Gmail but it's really it so 9.5
you get a good build quality a nice display
it's kind of said that we want to get eight gigabytes
then it's a very nice tablet all right
this is a quick review from these ten some Galaxy Tab 7.0
fire seven tablet for view here is the SD port
it's the heart just so you can have more data
then we have the jack for the headphones
so you don't really need wires and then there's like volume very nice usually
it comes with this camera in the back and this one upfront
they're not really good but this efficiently gets the job done
if you're gonna get this tablet for a present
I love this salad and I'm really happy with it
they also when they're driving around in the car
you're now to be able to see anything see you
yes you can see you with your thumb
oh and then you can have different profiles
were nice enough to send me a review
1560 drawing tablet rolls right off the tongue doesn't it
but this is where i need to give props to gaomon
it was a bit of a headache getting it to work
15.6 inch tablet with 18 92 and 81 92 pen pressure and hd ips
the plastic makes it come off as a bit cheap completely
i think for that you can also use the protective foil
on the top edge is where you'll find the headset jack
edge is where all the action is and here
the tablet on the cradle it charges the device wirelessly
del does install pocket cloud and Dropbox apps for external cloud storage and collaboration
comm with the Dell Venue 8 38 48 inch Android Intel powered tablet
hello everyone and welcome back to the friendly horse
here's the box and as you can see it's a
there wasn't much in the box you know
obviously there was a whatever they call it
the first thing that struck me it's quite heavy
i don't know if you can see that
but we've got power on and off volume up and down
that's the charging port and unfortunately it's only the old micro usb
it's not the usb type-c you've got a 3.5 millimeter headphone uh socket
there and then you've got two sockets here now
i'm gonna give it eight out of ten now screen
i have to tell you you know you know it it
um but you know it's what it is now ram
maybe an eight out of ten again now
the weak point of this tablet is the processor
you know things aren't quite as rapid as they could be so
that is the weak link in this device
and i'm only gonna score it four out of ten
i don't know if it's just this app
picture size is 13 megapixel on the rear
i'll give the camera a six out of ten battery
i'm not getting more much more than about five hours of screen on time
it's the full android 9 but that's it
it's going to be stuck on android 9 with a july 19 security patch
know certain websites vanco matrix pad z10 android tablet
probably just a little over 100 pounds because let's face it tablets
you know three gigs of ram fairly reasonable cameras
but you know if you're looking for something competitively priced
yeah i think i can get recommend it
the pen and this pen is battery less
it's nice and light very comfortable and then you have
I think you'll be fine too all right
first thing is the drawing size its 6.5 inches by 4 inches
you're drawing and right now from my research
this is on par with like 70 to $100 tablets in that regard
it's on par with tablets that cost around seventy to a hundred bucks
so that's another really good thing about this tablet for the price
I have the artistic talent of a tree stump
so don't expect anything fancy but you will get to see how this works
you could just lightly scribble something and then you know anyway
I think this shows enough of how it works
I'll have a link down in the description below
thank you for watching if you like commented subscribed
I appreciate it helps me out have a great day
hi Rosie good morning and welcome back to
the channel is the sketch monkey here and in today's video
I'm excited about this because it's not one of these expensive brands
can he get a redesign done without any hiccups or problems
and that's we're gonna figure out it right now
it might be mistaken for a tablet with a battery inside
it's simply a vein monitor that you can sketch on and it needs
it's a simpler stand but same thing here
you also have a scroll wheel for zooming in or out
is this little character inside the scroll wheel which
we have the case in which we'll find the pen
the pen itself is a little bit shorter than a
I only use the front button and I use that as a right mouse
15.6 throw the cables are pretty much straightforward young
not exactly sure what these things are but
I assume they are part of the Holiday Edition
you go enjoy now since this is a review
we have an active area of 344 by 193 millimeters
the tilt for the pad is 60 degrees
the pen is battery free in the shortcut keys
we have eight of them of course with the roller wheel
the surface feels a little softer than what
I'm used to as if the pen has more bounce in it
if that makes sense not a bad thing
I didn't really have to do any calibration or adjust
well it's pretty much the same as what
I have the keyboard next to the tablet
I use to control everything in Photoshop such as zoom pan rotate
I can see this set up being useful if you get used to it
this could create a nice workflow for summer but since
the contracts is has good blacks and whites and the responsiveness is sharp
I'm happy the rest is just stuff I never use or care about
it creates this gap between the two points
tablets this is a good thing because it means the
XP pen didn't interfere with my workflow and is the tool
done a good tool shouldn't bring too much attention to itself instead
I want without making a lot of noise about it if that makes sense
so that's the review of the XP pen artist 15.6
I say it did everything that I was expecting it to do
the bottom line here is if you're looking for a tablet a displace
it really means a lot to me if you enjoyed it
i love it because it looks very clean
the pan has a very nice grip right then
this is the latest one download extract the file and install
i can do whatever i want on this jam board
and above it currently does not support ios but uh the tablet supports
you can use it in your macbook but not on iphone at the moment
okay so you have to use it on your android phone
i don't have ones i couldn't test it for you
now let's move on to um photoshop right
just look at the photoshop so it also supports in photoshop
you can scribble you can color or you can change it
you can use it to color you can use it to draw
you can use it to scribble so far
i am i kind of like the the smoothing of it
so there you have it gaomon x620 which is really affordable uh in malaysia
i think it cost you less than 200 ringgit
the various links online on the e-commerce website like shopping malaysia
and all that because i think it cost you less than 180.
inches it is a 16 to 9 ratio so just standard widescreen
it's got a great great viewing angle 178 degrees
it's really not a big deal so it's really really nice
in fact it can reproduce a 16.7 million colors so
but it's a graphics tablet not a TV monitor or computer monitor
I guess some people might want it brighter
but this thing is not those things so
I think that's not a problem at all
it's up to you to decide if it is for you but for me
I don't have any issue with with the quality of the screen
it does come with a screen protector on it in the package now
there's almost no reflection so that's great and I don't mind the paper feel
I actually like the the smooth glass field
the inputs are toward the bottom of the display
I haven't had that be a problem in fact
stand which if you fold it all the way flat
I have no problem I keep it at about 45 degrees
some people have got could but for me
it hasn't for me because it's a really really really great displaced and
you just pull on it and adjust it and let go and you're done
I don't see I haven't seen at least in pictures
that aren't who yawn but they they don't look great from other companies
so it's not going to fly it around on your table now
it does connect only in the middle of the unit
but you're really going to have to push to notice it when
I suppose it depends on how you have it
Express keys which for me is not an issue
it has a few buttons for monitor settings
I have no use for hot or for Express keys so it's fine now
the pen is kind of an important part of a pen display tablet
so you actually get two pens in this package
having extra pens nice even though they last 800 continuous hours on a charge
you can do that four hundred times before it runs out of juice supposedly
I haven't been able to test that yet
they do give you the cable to charge it in the package
it's pretty much standard for these kind of tablets
I have an issue with for these pens
it will sometimes give you a little go to this step
I've noticed it might just be my the way I do my strokes
I don't know but that's something worth mentioning the Pens
do have two buttons on them which are assignable
you're going to want to use the artist gloves now
your hand will move smoothly across the screen protector
slide your hand across so having the artist
I mean I guess it could be nicer
it's not quite the same level as my television
I can't see how this isn't going to be a competitor
I don't know but at more than doubles of price
this one is definitely going to be worth worth giving a shot
so if you're not into this you might be into that not my thinks
I like the displays but you might want to check it out
I have new videos up every single day
click that little bell to turn on notifications
give the video a thumbs up if you liked it
it's baby no money whysa trial by him why she's trying

I'm bringing a new video today about a brand
Then there's a stand we'll have to fix to the tablet
a cleaning cloth and a half glove with this set
this one has a different design to what
which makes it too big to travel with it or move it around
it will take you no longer than a minute to do this now
we'll be downloading the drivers from the official page and run the Installer
I've decided to do a redraw of a drawing
I had drawing on big display if you can afford it
a size of minimum 13 inches is the best for a proper workflow
drawing in just 3-4 hours compared to drawings
I have to comment about the device for now
so you should definitely check it out you
i'll be reviewing this android tablet by vanco
it has a lot of features packed into it
and that's something that really stands out excellent build quality
it has the power button and the volume control
it also takes a 3.5 millimeters headphone jack at the top here
it has two speakers as well so the sound quality is brilliant
i would say around six up to six hours of usage time
so take care of the tablet when you buy it
generally this is a brilliant tablet for gaming
brit is brilliant for web serving for anything
um operating system so you can download majority of the thing
unlock weight of this is 525 um grams
so you've got all the features like android
you've got a security and location where you can use face unlock
it's a tablet that wouldn't overheat has amazing build quality
so it's just a free item really swell cotton see functioning function
Salam alaikum SMO so I need review was I believe a fertilizer time
MC uni near the 40 what we smile then
Pro with 4gb of RAM ting and 64 gig room HD
you know cheeto so their buggy free me that blue
okay for everything on okay in a placement and in which
yeah okay me try to get food all right so
I'm gonna use it right in stylus pen
I bet but I get that so the vision would be missing pen
memory is put a put a photo memories here 43.9
indeed had a pistol so Laguna placed on him to download stuff
syncope from the world can see me so
so what's up a stiffener body so the view volume
I see so funny like see that in this particular song
all right they see they put so far our food look at what
well good enough community who order hurry awkward
I had I could apparently I could have the the coded
Buland put up to join blend blend cat
Greg Oh Stevie this is the Vanco matrix pad
go edition which is like a simplified version of Android operating system
which will allow you to get a hundred ditional 128 gigabytes of storage per
which goes for that one goes for 50 bucks
another thing you might want to do on
this tablet is not a speed demon so loading up apps you can see
I mean it could be better but it's for 65 bucks
it's not too bad another thing you might want to do on
oh you got me but yeah you can see it
doesn't have any issue with it but again it's not a game
it has the search bar with the microphone
you also have a back button home button
they're not going to be sideways the way they are on most other devices
all that kind of thing that you would like
the other interesting thing is does not come with any bloatware which is wonderful
I said I wouldn't probably take any photos with it
it doesn't do video like I said but you can see
I mean you can definitely get a photo out of it
I would think for somebody that loves to read books
that doesn't want to spend a lot compared to the fire tablet
you know hardware specs or similar to it as the fire tablet
it's just an overall in for 65 bucks
it's don't expect a speed demon of a tablet
have it be you know looking at a website or playing a game
you can get this for you know a few dollars more fifteen dollars more
you can get this tablet so if you want to pick it up
I'll link it down below if you have any questions or comments
hi guys and welcome back to another product review
today we're gonna be looking at a new tablet from the company
you may recognize the name from the past
we previously reviewed their a1 and old version of the n1
but today we're gonna be looking at the new 2019 and one tablet
what's in the box and give you our top six features of this new
let's open the box and see what's inside okay so straight out the box
we have our warranty card with all the repair information
we have a USB charging cable and we have our USB charging plug
okay so now we've seen what's in the box
it's a brilliant feature and white isn't featured on
they're saying ten hours which is absolutely fantastic
they've got fantastic battery life and unlike other
Amazon tablets that we've reviewed and had when you put it to sleep
and that is the pre-fitted screen protectors on all of their tablets
an absolute mission to put on screen protectors
I think you're getting a fantastic tablet for the money
standalone tablet does not come with a keyboard not a detachable keyboard
I'm also running this on developer channel software something
69 is because we get this nice touch screen friendly
I wouldn't really recommend using them for anything
Arak chip our k33 nine-nine processor it's a six core
we can open up a couple of tabs here
it's not what I meant to do though
Chromebook that's one of the things that makes this sort of tablet
you've got this little back button down here on most screens
here and there is support for multiple windows of chrome
and if you wanted to do split-screen you can do that
sometimes they'll just want to take up the whole screen now
you have a couple of different options there
so let's go ahead and switch back to portrait mode
pull out the stylus and say we want to create a note
I'm not really sure what's going on there
I need to choose input with a pen
so it's kind of a slow way to enter text
let's draw a teddy bear so Charlie sure I can draw a scorpion
okay that should be a little bit easier oh
I know I see circle or blueberry or lollipop more for crappy
some apps seem to work better than others with it
so here for instance is an attack on
they're relatively easy to reset if anything goes wrong
tricky and overall performance can lag and the device can lock up now
it doesn't necessarily matter that this isn't as compact as it could be
but it includes a pen it includes the full
it definitely has a feel of a work in progress
not just the screen mode and I prefer a built-in keyboard husband for something
I usually prefer something a little bit smaller than nine point seven inches something
it's a little bit easier to hold in my hand and that's why
so that's the Chromebook Tab 10 this spradlin derp with little buting
i've tested out a bunch of tablets and i've deduced
the only tablet i really liked was actually my first tablet
drawing part of the screen just didn't work
about what huion tablets are actually like so
you got the main screen with seven customizable buttons and a wheelie thing
it's maybe a bit big for me but keep in mind
i have really small hands so if you get it you should be fine
the cables are very easy to set up
this is my article tablet compared to my other two tablets you can tell
the screen is really nice and doesn't reflect anything
unlike my huion does the driver is pretty easy to set up
it just feels like you're doing naturally on paper
i found that it works almost perfectly fine
it just didn't work well but only for the pencil
i looked around trying to fix it but i just couldn't find much
i used this tablet for half of this map
amv it's a reader of one of the frames in it
you should really go give it a watch
it's one of the best amv's i've seen in a very long time overall
this is a really great tablet especially for the price
I really like about it is that it's actually got curio genius on it
uh you don't have permission to use apps right now
if you've got a phone you can actually download the curio connect app
once you're connected you can actually send them pictures
you can send the messages you can send emojis
there's also a kiddo store all aimed at kids you know educational fun games
that is a lot that is a lot so what
we hope you enjoyed this video for more help and information go to curate
here and welcome back to another product review in this one
the bat huion was gracious enough to send this to me
let's just let's just get the pleasantries out of the way
which first you get a little little thank-you card which is pretty nice
I said this is gonna be mostly a talking head video
so if you don't care about the visuals and you just want to listen
go to the website and get the drivers
this is kind of weird for me as you
anyone who's watched my videos before knows that
this is a graphics tablet the difference between this a graphics tablet when
I'm used to which is I think you can see
tablets are not like that you plug this in through USB
I've never played it and then I guess
the H for 20 apparently has three buttons on it
I see where the 420 comes from four by two point twenty
three resolution is four thousand lines per inch
I don't think this would be your main tablet
I actually would recommend taking a look at this now
but it's probably gonna get in the way here and say oh
I would have no problem giving them this and saying here
if you enjoyed the video give it a thumbs up
make sure you use the subscribe sub scribe and hit the little
all right i got this new tablet and it is a wonderful size
um it's got a very nice high-end camera and it just it runs beautiful
um i'm just going to pop over here to youtube real quick
uh internet connection just really nice internet connection
um i don't know what all we got going on here
let me see but i mean it goes through
um i mean it handles the memory chips
i was going to bring up my netflix
just so how nice that is and it sounds sounds real
now this is a tablet that is designed to replace all your notebooks
so you can write on this tablet you can read pdfs
you have of course the remarkable two tablet
you also have replacement tips for the stylus
personally it does not feel like writing on paper there is friction
i wouldn't complain that oh this doesn't feel nice
your palm won't interfere with the writing on the tablet so the whole writing
there are very few features but all of them are very useful
you can copy and paste little sections onto different notebooks and different pages
the undo and redo feature is of course really cool something that naturally
if you're writing in a notebook you wouldn't be able to do so
it's a bit like a notebook but on steroids
then another really cool thing is the convert to text feature
you can quickly convert text and send it to yourself via email now this
i use it every day multiple times a day
whoever i've shown this to so for example my sister she absolutely loves it
she wants one so everybody i've shown this to they
it doesn't feel like using a samsung tablet
i wore out my first pen tip within about two to three months
that's not too bad but i just expected the pen tips to last longer
also do not give this device to kids they will f it up
because then you can just be done with it in the tablet
you don't have to carry around a bunch of different notebooks
that's pretty much it for this week's video
if you enjoyed it give it a thumbs up
share it with your friends and subscribe to my channel for weekly content
you can use it for drawing playing also and online teaching
we do the considerations watching the drawing process that i've made using vague establish
i really like this tablet because it's small
besides you can draw on your cell phone
i never was able to draw my my cell phone
this tablet is my recommendation to people who want to start drawing digital art
this is a 7-inch 800 x 480 screen
capacitive screen has a 16 29 widescreen ratio
nothing here has two external speakers it has a docking port
are these three buttons here on the bezel
there's a home button mini button in a back button
unfortunately they are not backlit so in the dark
you're not going to be able to see these buttons
so let's just turn this on and you does use android 2.0
it has some apps listed here on the bottom
okay one complaint that we had and hopefully there will be a firmware update
it's really not as responsive as we will hope especially from a capacitive screen
so this is definitely something that we're very disappointed with as you can see
it's not as responsive as we want but let's go to the browser
which is our preferred browser of course anything better than stock browser
it's going to make your your interview in
Europe is going to make your internet viewing a better experience for right
let's just go to the New York Times website okay
we have had experience obviously with the epad
disillusion and how small this really is compared to to a 10-inch tablet
so as you can see there's not much real estate on here
that we're having with the responsiveness of the tablet
usually our internet connection is not this slow
I guess there's a lot of people on online today
the stock browser the pinch to zoom does not work on the stock browser
just for your information and let's go back there
let me apologize for again the delay in the the Wi-Fi connection here
we're going to show you the multimedia functions
there is no pinch to zoom in here as you can see
the external speakers do work well with music
well no problems at all at least with this file
now we do have problems with this 720 video you watch again
that just really has a hard time processing this
i think it was a 1.3 version of the app
gigahertz am or 11 processor the image in the resolution which were significantly better
in here again you can see how pixelated it is
it just gives you a poor resolution of it
Android apps that the suite of Android apps obviously google android market
mind that if you will use the cruise market do not use
the any other browsers accepts a stock browser
obviously there's not many apps here one thing
excuse to try to increase the number of so-called apps on their market
the quality is very good on this though
I must say it does appear to be glass
thank you very much for watching talak connect
it's got a single back button below the screen uh smudge prone back
you got a speaker on the back as well
it's just got kind of like rounded edges
uh so i do like the design of the pocketbook
i just wanted to compare the page turns initially because the pocketbook
it's really slow to turn pages as you can see here
so i find it interesting that uh i mean the screens
look so completely different as you can see here so yeah
the puck look a little bit slow to respond here
so one thing about the onyx is it
so let's just keep that down for this comparison
so let's load up a different comic here
um so like this page is a little bit interesting like on the pocketbook
it doesn't have the best refresh so you have to kind of refresh it
i actually have a setup to minimize ghosting
you still get quite a bit of ghosting
how different the colors are on these two devices
when you're using onyx's you know customizable contrast or color saturation settings so yeah
i find it very interesting that how different these two screens look
so um that's one thing that pocketbook definitely has an advantage on
so yeah the refresh is definitely better on the pocketbook
how these two devices with the same screen can perform so differently
another thing i notice is like a text balloons with the onyx
see how much darker the text is they have more of a contrast control
you don't have control over that kind of stuff
here's sort of a similar layout with the text
when you're using just a regular ebook we got
you control the contrast separately from boldness whereas the pocketbook
it just has a boldness option so when you go bold
i've kind of find that it's just too thick
i say it's a little more neutral on the pocketbook
front lights vary so much from one to the next though
someone told me that you can install a reading or a a viewer app
that will make the uh comics a lot faster
the puck book is like 90 cheaper than the onyx which is significant
this is a Smart Tab 2 in 1 tablet as you can see
here is the front of the box the top the side the other side
and you have the back in the back
you got all the specifications for the tablet itself but this
I would explain that on in the video
it's like a box inside the box with inside
ok this is the tub itself it is pretty heavy
pick this out see here or just patience
and oh yeah it smells like plastic all right
this is the front it does have a matte finish to it hasit material
the head jack micro USB DC slot with the reset button all this button
we have the second speakers on the top
we have the front camera you know for some reason
it did not work with this video so
I'm guessing this is meant for music playing
this these options will not work only the playing pause
pad is that it cannot be clicked like a normal mouse pad
sometimes the mouse pointer will not land on that specific item
since the mouse pad is a bit jet-lagged
Amazon okay so the keyboard keys are a tad bit small
now let's test out both of the cameras and see how they compare
I'm pretty sure if I kept on playing this game
I got around 2 to 3 hours of gameplay overall
not really maybe if it was 20 to 25 dollars less
welcome to a new video on the geeky noise channel in today's video
i'm going to be sharing my opinion about this android tablet
it was sent in free of charge by the manufacturer for me to review
we've also got just at the top here
apart from a couple of speakers at the bottom
let me just unlock this again and put my uh passcode in
i don't want that on camera and here we go
we are unlocked so it's just a passcode unlocked
point is an extremely extremely good price point
it's mainly the google apps that are pre-installed
a good selection of apps pre-installed on this also
actually let's concentrate on this a little bit better
now it does come pre-installed as well with a screen protector
the primary build quality on the side is plastic
you've got some grip along this bottom edge
it's a matte finish on the back and the cameras aren't fantastic
though it's a very very nice product really great great value for money
so this is the drug dragon touch max 10
i think it's a very very nice budget
pocket friendly android tablet that still delivers a great experience
nice size screen and overall very impressed with it
ark27 and d d v stata omega greetings from texas awesome
it's really good plenty of you tuning in so thank you for that
if you're not already subscribed please do subscribe
i've got another video coming up very soon
and i'll see you all again on camera on youtube very very soon
it is flexible so it won't break easily in my opinion
I also wait to change battery in our pants sometimes
this is really nice tablet but you need to get used of it
I think that I've said everything about this tablet
make sure to leave a like and subscribe see ya
and they haven't paid me any money or anything to give any positive reviews
sent me the tablet for me to give my honest opinion in this video
we'll pick two winners to win those 580 tablets
this is not available to everyone in the world
the first thing is a thank-you note from Shu
Yan and underneath that is the tablet itself and I was actually really impressed
it looks very stylish and very professional having the twelve buttons along
the left side looks great as well underneath
that is a bag for storage and for traveling
they provide the rechargeable pen which again looks amazing
the build quality on both the pen and the tablet is super impressive
the tablet has a ten by six point
two five inch active area with 2048 levels of sensitivity it also has 12
the tablet comes with eight gigs of memory on a micro
I'm going to try and bring to the channel this year
I'm really glad that I got this opportunity
because this tablet has been so fun to use so huge
this video are hugely appreciated as always another huge
thank you so much for watching this video
I hope you're having an amazing day and I'll see you all soon you
Android multifunction tablet aimed primarily at beginners to digital art and students
it comes with both a pressure-sensitive pen and a case in the video
thank you to some bands for sending me
so thank you very much to them for that as always with my reviews
my thoughts and opinions are 100% honest and my own
the tablet comes well packaged in a nice box
there are a few different bits and pieces
then there's the pen which is battery-operated and the box contains two batteries
the tablet itself is not as thin or as light as other tablets
I've placed a layer of plastic over the tablet screen
just because the tablet was reflecting everything and in order to film
I had to come up with a solution for the video
so that's why there's a layer of plastic over the tablet
the tablet does come with a screen protector
the tablet fits into the case really snugly and one of the things
everything is included in one box and I really liked that
the case felt pretty well made to me
the pen also feels really nice in the hand
it's very similar in size to a regular ballpoint pen
to the case the setup for the tablet was really easy
it even had a line straightening feature which
it felt very much like a regular pen
it glided across the screen very well and the only thing
I didn't like about the pen was the fact that it took batteries
the pen was especially compared to some of my other digital stylus pens
the tablet is meant to have palm rejection
I found this feature to actually be very good
talk about the palm rejection not working very well for them
not all apps and brushes are pressure sensitive
I found that sketching things on the tablet was really enjoyable
the tablet definitely did have a little bit of lag
I noticed it more at the beginning but as I was working
I didn't find the lag to be bad at any point
I thought it was good when I placed the pen down on the screen
you may be noticing during the sketching phase of this drawing
is that some of my lines of wobbly
when i zoom in further the lines are much better and smoother
I've also found the move ability of the tablet really useful
then this tablet could be a good fit for you
so that's about it for the review today to sum up
I think the tablet is good value for the price point
it's not going to have the resolution or the power than a much
more expensive tablet will have but as an entry level tablet
the pen was good and it comes with a case as well
my name is alex and welcome back in today's video
so this tablet is powered by an octa-core cpu
that's paired with 4 gigs of ram and 64 gigs of internal storage
but we'll talk more about that later on in the video
we have a six thousand milliamp hour battery and on one charge
the back of the tablet is not gonna get damaged so for the price
i'm not a big fan of drawing on tablets
it is a bit on the heavier side
so if you'd be to compare this to an ipad
so it's a good thing that we have dual speakers
we have a 8 megapixel camera so those cameras are definitely useful
so this is a recording done with a front facing camera on this tablet
they're not using a heavy launcher on top of that android 10.
well that's not the case with this one
the tablet also doesn't company installed a bunch of useless apps
everything works pretty smooth mostly taking in consideration
how affordable this tablet is with that four gigs of ram
if you want to do a split screen you can
but everything that i've done with it does seem to work on pretty decent
i was also able to play call of duty now
the experience isn't going to be as good as a more expensive tablet
the tablet also supports dual band wi-fi so of course
if you're using the five gigahertz wi-fi band you will get better
everything you get in the box for that money i feel that
not to mention this is much more powerful than the last fasting tablet
i've tried maybe like four months ago now
of course there are some more powerful tablets available on the market
i think this will do great all right guys
thanks for watching and i will see you in the next one
hey guys the CTA Prime back here again today
if you can get it for the right price
you're gonna receive the charger and I believe this came with a stylus
I mean it's definitely all made of the plastic but this little crooked
I think the PCB is kind of hanging off inside of here
the keyboard does attach to the tablet with these little magnets here
it'll disconnect the keyboard from the tablet even when
point one gigahertz but we do have a burst
33 megahertz this is non-user upgradeable and is soldered to the mainboard
it's 802 that 11n Wi-Fi plus bluetooth 4.0
it's definitely not the best screen in the world but for an $80 tablet
with this tablet another thing would be the 32 gigabytes of internal storage now
is this keyboard not working even at $80
this keyboard should attach and it should work right out of the box
plus there's a copper pad on the back casing
they use gloves but I don't think they're using them where they're assembling these
so it will be a bit slower than if it was running in
it is before we get into the testing
it's around eighteen hundred for the single core and three thousand for multi
so we're right on spot with the multi but single core is much lower
I figured I'd test out some PC games
we have csgo 720p all low settings get an average of around fifteen
I can never get sound out of HDMI with this
I turn as much as I could down
Li 720p although settings average 19 there was one game that performed quite well
but that's pretty much a given this thing runs on pretty much everything
this is actually the Windows Store version either way
set moving over to some emulation first up
we have some dreamcast using the re dream emulator this is
4000 CPUs PSP is another one that performs pretty decently on the in 4000
this has got a four chains of olympus a harder one to emulate
this is just a harder one to run along with
so if you've been thinking about picking one of these up
so that's pretty much it for this video guys
just let me know in the comments below
but there's only so many screens and rooms to go around
okay so let's pretend pretend we're surprised right unbox it
oh it's so clean and then the best part of any new electronics
oh yeah hey you can see my camera rig
speaking of which headphone jack someday these will be history
I need to pick one up before my next road trip
it's about a hundred and forty dollars on Amazon
so you feel like you're reading a newspaper
it's much more readable than person than it appears
here it doesn't come through very much on camera
that's supposed to make it easier on your eyes for late night
the camera loses fine detail and it makes things look like a beauty filter
Netflix back-to-back with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on when playing movies from the SD card
I got four to our movies with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned off
there is occasional UI lag high-performance games and apps can struggle a bit
the same thing happens on my s10 so who knows
the camera juts out just enough about the width of a piece of paper
those are becoming a vestigial feature on other products anyway so
I can't really hold that against this tablet
the camera falls a little short model specific accessories
like cases and screen protectors will be hard to come by
but if you're stuck indoors like me who needs a case anyway
this is the newbie and I'll see you later kids turtles
a truly glass screen not plastic like the ifly tech flush screen
embezzle this one's truly glass as you see on the right here
so this one's actually dipped down about a millimeter
there are a fair amount of things in the way in fact
the onyx is a fully fledged note-taking android
google play enabled device with audio and video
that's an indisputed fact that you can do more on this than this
but in terms of the overall look and appearance and everything
reading is a little bit different and looking at them with your eyes
adobe whatever the case may be you can put it on here
although both of these display manga beautifully they both do pinch and zoom they
the flush screen has nothing to do with it
you actually do have three different modes you have speed mode a2 and normal
i don't care what the advertisement campaigns say about either of these two
check it out if you want to see individual reviews and comparisons on these
in this video we're gonna unbox and review the van
the first thing you'll notice is the large 8 inch IPS screen IPS
technology is better than LCD technology because it allows for better viewing angles
Keogh matrix sa tablet is powered by a quad-core CPU
I really love the fact that it's a clean vanilla Android experience
it honestly feels like a pixel device with no bloatware unlike
Samsung which has all this bloatware in general
it's very light and compact even at 8 inches
it's very easy to hold on one hand
I think this is a really good budget tablet
it's not too big but it's not too small
I'm able to connect to the Panasonic image app such that
it allows me to see what my camera sees remotely
it's been very helpful and I really appreciate the larger 8 inch screen anyways
that's it for this review of the Venky
thanks for watching it and I'll see you in the next video
now if you follow my channel you know
that is up until now i took delivery of this
i'll check it out in my new series so stay tuned
that's coming soon now for those that do follow my channel
and that was unfortunate because i really loved that two-in-one check out that review
all the opinions you're about to hear are my own
they're seeing this video for the first time just like you now
this unit was purchased with my own money
let's find out what you get inside the box
that's good and as i mentioned you get the keyboard cover
we'll get to that in just a moment
it's a usbc power adapter and it's pretty compact
we'll get into that a little bit later
it has a really nice anti-fingerprint coating on it not too many smudges
it has that legendary thinkpad style keyboard with the trackpoint
and it's working well so far and yes
the magnetic connection to the keyboard is very secure
and speaking of the kickstand very rigid and very sturdy
we like to see that especially over the long haul
hopefully that will stay that way and here
they have a very similar size and similar footprint
the ports on the left side is a usbc 3.2 gen1 port and above
that is the sim tray for the optional
jack moving over to the right side is the kensington
this area is look at all these laptops
you know this is the life of the tech reviewer
this is where i sit for my live streams and so forth
there's the back of the studio which is a total mess with boxes
don't mind the mess that's going to change
i'm going to straighten it up so don't worry about it now
it did 1080p video so not bad for a two in one
plus where you have to pay extra for the keyboard and the pen
no complaints on that front working really well now
the pen doesn't stick magnetically to the side
as far as performance is concerned this is running the core i5 1130 g7
don't expect it to be a major powerhouse
it's soldered into the motherboard and my unit has a gigabyte ssd drive
considering it is a low-powered tiger lake processor worked really well
i don't think but this is really an excellent competitor
what do you think about this bad boy
now i love the fact that the pen and the keyboard are included
you can pretty much count on all day battery life
don't forget to leave a comment in the comment section below
i'll do my best to try to make that happen
I just throw it over a cross-leg to balance it out
and it's active pen too with the tablet
so you're ready to go out of the box
you'll probably have trouble using it outside on
what's a bit of an annoyance though is that lenovo's pin storage solution
we got 6 hours and 27 minutes in our streaming video test
i still made to some other tablets that are slightly
but keep this in mind as i'm talking about them
this review was supposed to be at the launch of the tablet
but with how crazy this year has been
i reviewed last year inside of the box
and the tablet only comes with what it needs which to be
feel of this tablet more than anything else
i've used so far even my ipad pro
the button on the pen is actually quite frustrating to use
i think that i can push aside those relatively minor shortcomings
the drivers was also incredibly easy and xp pens
i'd say that the drawing experience feels quite nice
i still think it's a tablet that is worth buying if its strengths fit
xp pen always seems to be looking to improve their products
and i hope that they'll appreciate some of the feedback i've given here
it covers the same things that i'm going to talk about in this video
so let's do a very quick unboxing first the packaging box
this is a thank you card and this is
this is the most premium looking and feeling tablet that
so let me click this aside and show you the set arrays
this is the box with manual and driver
that has a pen and a wireless receiver
there is one charging cable for the pen because the pen is also battery-powered
let's take a closer look at the pen case
this is the 10 it has a nice weight to it
two buttons on the side it has a matte surface texture
there are eight replacement lips provided and this is the USB receiver
this is a bit small so be careful not to lose this
you need to plug this into your computer
in order for the computer to be able to detect wireless tablet
it's a very comfortable working area for screen that is 20 inches
and this is the track pad for the track pad
all the basic finger gestures like pinch to zoom pan
so here we can customize the pressure sensitivity of the pan
you can choose the dowel here on the right side here
and this is where you can customize the two side buttons
you will not go to the right side this is other
the transition between a thin and thick lines is very soon suddenly
Bank so that's one glitch that I found this
is this cheat pressure books here as well this is
it's the same problem with MIDI Bank pain to prove
and now let's do a quick pro's and con's recap so the major
they asked move as well not angular and this applies to
and you lift up your pen suddenly there
I show you that you can pinch to zoom with photoshop
Pro quite well they work well but with MIDI Bank pinch
I think we need a pinch to zoom in
they are 9s they have a nice tactile feel to them and it worked
I prefer to turn off the functionality of the trackpad for me
you're charging the tablet so that's quite real anyway
see you in the next video bye you
Brad Linder with will repeating and this is an asus memo pad 8
it's got the same intel atom z3580 fastest chip on the market
but it's going to be good enough to give you a pretty good performance
we've got stereo speakers which are on the back here
and they're only on one sides if you're holding it in landscape mode
rotation you could make this the topic you really wanted to
I said there's a couple of nice touches there
Google Play Store and while early tablets with Intel Atom processor is
I feel like didn't do a great job of running every Android app
we've got support for pinch-to-zoom webpages load reasonably quickly
when you're not having issues connecting to the internet or something yep
I've had no problems with Netflix or YouTube
so it doesn't really matter how you're holding the tablet
you should be able to see don't know
some people might lament that it doesn't have a full
HD screen held a reasonable distance from your face
you're probably not going to see a huge difference
between this and a tablet with a 1280
you don't hear anything coming out of this side speakers reasonably loud so overall
I like where Asus is going and I like where
you're probably not going to notice much especially now that
I think that's the way it should be one thing
I think I forgot to show here is
let's go ahead and there is a custom keyboard application here
there's a lot to like for $1.99 budget
alright so let's start so it's quite small
that seems like something nice to start with
it's thin you can see but it doesn't
I've seen they all need a battery battery free pen
we got nice and this is not an actual CD
download all right so one of the things
I sample with alt and I switch between the colours with X
I always had that this way so this is really great so far
you have of course the mapping you can map it in my case
my and/or the mapping because there's such little space but if
so let's see how it does in clip studio
it's very small something you would take on the road probably from what
I understand you can also play games with games
that is so definitely a nice little tablet very versatile
very lightweight doesn't take much space perfect for beginners or outdoors traveling
I would definitely keep it as a backup
the pen feels really nice and big closet
let's just jump right into it as you all know
i've been using vague tablets until this day
all are the other necessary accessories as you can see here
i was quite surprised to see two pens
the fact that they had to provide two pens is amazing
it has a very nice feel to it
we have here the greeting card a cleaning cloth to help
we have the cables to connect the tablet to your computer
eventually and here we have so many extra nibs and a key nib remover
i swear they provide so many nibs which is insane
it's a 11 by 6 inch display tablet
i love the design and its thickness overall
the colors are way different from my laptop which is good
the screen has an anti-glare design which also can protect your eyes
i'll link it in the description down below
i'm comparing its size to my ipad which is 11.2 inches
what i like about bix driver is that it's not separated per model
it's just one driver installation and no matter
what big tablet you plug in it will detect which model you're using instantly
i always provide a speed paint process so in today's occasion
which is ya boi kaiman from doro hedora
the fact that it only has two cables needed was beyond my relief
i also did a fingerprint test and it doesn't leave any behind
that is very slippery and stuff like that it
it gave me the feel that i was like literally drawing on paper
well you can take it on the go which is very convenient
and of course it's battery free so no need to charge the pen
i love the product definitely recommend to any beginner artist
you can ask your relatives as a christmas gift
or what inspired you to do digital art
well i bid you guys good luck and stay safe everyone bye you
you has made some very nice touches with this particular tablet however
that is the charging cords that it comes with
it just doesn't quite sit in as it should
I don't want to fit into certain cases
this is open enough to come any and it does come with a micro
put it in there and then you can cover it up which is like
I said actually a nice thing because it prevents accidents accidental popping out
click they respond excellently superlatively so nicely done
you notice how it's grayed out that's inherent to all IPS displays now
I just have the kids at Kids Place which is a very safe environment
because this is huge as you can see
so that's a huge selling point in my eyes and of course
it was pretty rare to actually have these budget
so you just go to settings go into bluetooth
they're either you know market for kids but they act
although very well fit on a child does have a enormous amount of flexibility
you just turned that button on that button is only for the FM transmitter
you're going to want to look at the instructions
I did which is really unusual for someone like me
who's you know gone through hundreds of headphones
it's just nicely done its depth out of the
this is the third pair of kids headphones
I've evaluated and this is definitely without a doubt
I mean these are some upgraded kids headphones
these are definitely not what you expect with the kids headphones
it's emphasized ties but with some bass punch to it
it's good pair of headphones so between the two
a lot of great touches with context shows kids tablets and headphones
so this is the vankyo matrix z1 tablet
now this is a very low end tablet it features android
it would have been a better price point
i think for this but overall it's a very cheap tablet
there's really not much to say about it
it's got good viewing angles and overall not a bad
tablet does its job but nothing special you
Android drawing tablet that was sent to me recently by the company sim bents
so that got me interested to review this tablet but before
let's check out the things that are included in the Box
there is not much printed on it not even the specifications
the tablet is prized at us $200 and it includes this carrying case
the tablet has a one-year warranty and here in this small box
we have the power cables and pulp locks
that's included this is the USB charging cable that's included
this will go to the wall charger and this site here this
it doesn't make that have let go to sleep
this material is quite smooth and there are
here there is no eraser at the back of the pen
I'm not sure about the battery life but it's supposed to last quite long
I haven't used the pen enough to drain out all the battery
I do not see any replacement tips included so
you get this pen you get the case you get tablet
I actually do not expect a lot from a tablet
there's price range especially when they included all the freebies as you can see
this is a 10-inch screen on the front
and it's a bit heavy a bit thicker or behaviour compared to other
Android tablets that I have used before on this side
we have some buttons and pots the power buttons here
they are quite close together so sometimes when I'm pressing the power button
I mean accidentally press the volume button speaker on this side
though this is the 3.5 mm audio jack
a small microphone port and this is the micro SD card slot
I can also sort of show you how fast the Internet is loading
this tablet will auto rotate so these are the specifications
the viewing angles are quite good as well
this is not a very high resolution screen for a 10-inch screen like this
that's the recommended app for use with this stylus
let me show you some strokes on sketchbook app first so
this is something that you have to get used to so these are slow
wahwah drawing this lines and I had some stray strokes here so palm rejection
I'm going to put that tablet in the case
so this sort of prevents those straight strokes from happening enough of the testing
so let's try and draw a quick sketch using this pen and have it
you can use finger gestures if you draw at this speed that
Jeter it's not really that big of problem
I can raise my palm on this side here drawing performance
I do not have a lot of jitter
here's another sketch that I drew earlier with sketchbook
let me just scroll slowly to let you see the lines
this are how the lines will look like
sometimes there are jitter but sometimes there aren't any so for lines like this
there are some slight cheater but overall still looks quite smooth
for some reason the strokes in up flow they are a bit smoother
compared to sketchbook pressure sensitivity is supported here as well but again palm rejection
it doesn't work too well but I'm glad that the strokes here
sometimes it depends on the app that you use there is still some slack
oh let's do a quick sketch again because palm rejection doesn't work very well
I'm going to raise my palm on the case here
what though definitely feels much smoother compared to sketchbook and
so if you look at this sketch that i drew at normal speed
I think it's a bit difficult for me
this is quite responsive you can definitely take notes with this dollars
I think captured quite accurately although not at 100% accuracy but for Android tablets
there is slight lack but not for a big problem
so let me draw those slow diagonal lines again
there is slight cheater but not too bad compared to other apps
life for this tablet is actually quite good
I can get around 8 to 10 hours on a hundred percent charge
this is at its brightest in fact let me just
I'll show you how dim it can be
you can use it to watch youtube videos but the song isn't that great
you can surf the web panning and zooming
so that's a good price point for those
we've limited budget for students for beginners who want to try our digital sketching
I am more than satisfied when drawing with this pen and tablet the 10.1
inch screen is a good size to draw on color
Jeeter but some apps they are they perform better so again
the drawing performance is as you have seen
do you think it's good enough for digital sketching
hello everyone it's Apple mint and welcome back again to my channel as always
so if you're into art videos please consider subscribing so for today's video
I received this tablet a few weeks ago from huion
thank you so much for sending me this
I know but this tablet is totally amazing
Julian always includes these little thank-you cards so this is the best part
so this is the tablet stand so it opens up like this actually
you don't have to worry about having this gigantic stand with you
you can just slip this into your backpack with your tablet and you're good
so yeah these these are really they really come in handy
this is the pen case and the pen is actually a lot nicer right
these are so so useful so uh yeah
so this tablet if you buy it off
Amazon which I will provide the link below
or you can purchase this it is 483 dollars and let me tell you
their tablets tend to be super super expensive
they're like the Apple iPhone of the tablet market
they are really expensive and their quality is really good
it is a really good tablet for what you pay for
it is amazing so you know this is honestly my new
I love health than it is at the price
because if you're looking at a Wacom Cintiq which is 13 inches
it's about like $1000 so already right there
I think in this price range you should
it should have it and this one luckily does so
that's another plus and just the overall portability of this tablet is really nice
I I'm gonna say it's not you know it's not perfect you know
I would definitely definitely say to take a look at this tablet
I've always wanted a nice tablet screen tablet and I just kind of love
thank you for sending it to me so
there's a link in my description on exactly where you can get this tablet
i'm going to be reviewing the gammon m10k 2018 drawing tablet
i'm going to flip it over again and let's see what's in the box
it's really nice as you cannot see in that angle
this is the first badge or is it
um i don't know why i didn't think that it was a case
it obviously is fits on the tablet nicely
let's just see if it fits in there
so those are the nibs and that silver thin tape them out
oh it's really nice so it has two buttons
that's not the right way you put it in but okay
i thought that was only with the pro version
but that's really nice of jam on to include that
i'm gonna open the bag inside the bag
um if i can yay there we go
everybody does then the warranty card then how to download the driver all right
the pros are that it's smooth and i really like all of it
the only con i have is that there was a strain recorder
good there you are my name is Alex and welcome to a new review
I'm not sure how useful this could be
I guess you could use this as a mini PC
we also have four gigs of RAM 64 gigs of internal storage dual band
the box is the brand name and the model name inside the box
those metallic legs can be used as a stand
the device itself so even though this is not that big
it's not as comfortable to hold so for example
then you can basically hold it in your pocket if you want
you're going to find the holes for the speaker and
I do believe that this has only one speaker
the speaker doesn't seem to get that loud either
and lastly on the back we have the port for the power adapter
now the battery life will depend from user to user
and how you use your tablet connectivity wise
alright so first of all these loops just like any other mini
I notice that I didn't like that much was the screen resolution
I didn't do a whole bunch of updates yesterday
I also wanted to show you the task manager here
this is the RAM so we have available two point two gigs of ram
at this time this is the harddrive yes so we have a Samsung Quran
that we've seen on our other mini pcs with the exact same configuration
this is the hard drive so we have some type of a Samsung storage
and you can probably tell it stops it goes again it stops
it goes against all not a better experience for watching YouTube videos
just you have a better idea how code use the form for live strings
so let's keep on this again and we'll just wait a second
I'm not even sure if we should try the other file
look if it's going to be the same all done all of them
let's try this on just out of curiosity turn again
there is no point in trying other ones
because you've seen there girl needs slow motion so long
I wanna play a game for a couple of minutes
how gaming would do on this okay so
I totally enjoyed this video if you did like it press that like button
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you in the next one
the drawing tablet i've had for the longest
satisfying shot and with the drawing tablet comes a little drawing glove
the other cap serves as a pen stand
the left side of the tablet has eight customizable shortcut keys
there's a little red dial that you can either use to scroll or zoom
i hope you enjoyed my little review of it now
I used the translator :,,) I HAVE A TABLEEEEET!
So ... I'll show you what it brings, I guess first
the first thing we see is the huge tablet, I can't believe it
It has ten shotcut buttons, man, TEN, WHAT TABLET GIVES YOU TEN BUTTONS
beautiful felt case, does not use batteries and does not have to be recharged
Look at her, how beautiful (inclusive language, Hispanic thing, info. in desc) also later,
because that's what amazed me the most when...
ok, class, let's see how well you draw hair)
nope, it didn't die, it's only in ... (how to make an interesting protagonist?
the meme is a backstory, but not a character, it is a fact
I hope I can show if I do the pilot ...
I don't know, make theories, I don't know, you are for that >:^
ok, you saw how everything works, it is beautiful <3 now
that's less than half of what it costs about 10 seconds of wefere
(Hispanic thing x2) make your investments u u
I wanted you all to see it too
it's actually different from the color in two ways
and since it's now a tablet it has a dual-core
you'll be spending most of your time touching the beautiful 7 inch
Amazon they don't have a place to buy music on the device
hi everyone and welcome back in today's video
the tablet taking a look at what comes in the box
so the tablet comes really well packaged in a sturdy box
everything is well protected and set into a molded packaging insert
the first thing in the box is the tablet
it has an IPS screen with a 1920
there is a full list of specs over on the Galman website
it's just one that you can draw on
I liked here that the cables were all connected as it keeps everything tidier
issues they have all the drivers for their products available for both
the driver took less than a minute and so did the installation once installed
I could fiddle and adjust any of the settings to the tablet
I was ready to start drawing for the drawing portion of this video
I'm starting out drawing lines and swirls varying the amount of pressure
how much pressure to apply to get the line that you want
the pen itself is actually a bit shorter and slimmer than the other
it was also a little lighter as well
Galvan Pen and some of the other drawing tablets
I've reviewed in the past is the lack of battery or charging cable
but that was the computers issue and not the tablets one thing
I did find however was that the tablet heated up as I was working
now this is the same as my other
it's a small tablet the working area of the screen
it's actually just a little bit less than this
I normally do as my other tablet is much heavier and thicker
it's also important that you have the updated driver software as well one thing
I want to mention here is that the tablet doesn't come with a stand
this again is going to be entirely personal preference
some of you may prefer working completely flat
Galman for sending me along this new model to have a look at
thank you all for watching and have a creative day you
today i'm going to review my first ever powerblock graphics tablet
the first thing you will notice is design
and this part you see extends from the right top corner
let's start um let's start with a quick unboxing first
they all are pretty similar to wacom intuos graphics templates
it looks like a good quality battery free stylus
it doesn't have a rubber grip but it looks comfortable
it is usb type-c my favorite and also it looks super sturdy
and there are two usb adapters for the android mode one type
let's start testing as soon as you plug it
it would be great if it was heavier
the tablet and the pen shows a really good performance
now it is time to test the android mode
the good thing is the cursor is visible
i know there might be shorter problems in samsung phones
and i will record a video about that with the solution
your phone needs to be in the portrait mode guys
it's good and finally i will change the nib and yes
yeah it's a good price for a medium-sized graphics
it does the job uh by the way guys
if you have any questions please comment below and let me know
i'll be with you in another video about online teaching
I was on have come back with the Amazon fire
its internal storage comes in two sizes ranging from 8 gigabytes to 16 gigabytes
however you can't just increase the internal storage yourself
by inserting a micro SD card up to a maximum of 256 gigabytes
is that it already comes pre-installed with Amazon's personal assistance Alexa
how good is this tablets to actually use now
the camera for sleep does let it down and should really only be used
it is in fact just a simple tablet
that's entirely on what you need it for
hello everyone and welcome to the second installment of the seer
today i will be reviewing a graphic drawing tablet specifically the goemon
i still don't know how to pronounce it pd
i will review the tablet and then unbox it
i'll start things off with some basic facts about the tablet
it has a very nicely sized 15.6 inch display
there are also 5 buttons on the side
the other four are used to adjust the display settings of the tablet
now let's go over how to set this thing up
the first thing to do is assemble the stand
there are four screw holes on the stand
there are even pictures to show you how to do it
I think this is the first product I've ever received
where a Phillips head screwdriver was provided I loved it
it would have taken to find my own
the next thing to do is get it connected to your computer
it's time to download the driver which you can find on the goemon website
you've already made before in the work area
lastly there are the press keys aka shortcuts which
I am so very fond of in drawing tablets
there are 10 shortcuts which you can format using the fairly intuitive button
I don't like it when tablets are smooth or slippery
in my opinion the pressure sensitivity worked fine and the shortcuts also worked well
there isn't much else to say about it except it draw good now
please enjoy this footage of me drawing some stuff on the tablet
I gave her a small spoon to use
she made surprisingly quick work of the box
despite the excess use of packaging tape that had been applied to it
the items it contained were a note from
for one of those screen covers that are super satisfying to peel off
and yeah what it's supposed to be is a textured screen
alrighty let's move on to some final thoughts
I don't like the software that goemon has made for
this isn't a complaint about the tablet itself
but if you get the tablet you'll have to deal with the software
I do because you can't set different shortcut inputs for specific software
connect the tablet to a power source and connect the tablet to your computer
it's not a bad thing that this tablet isn't portable or convenient
it's just that it shouldn't be marketed that way
lastly is that it feels kind of cheap
I'm not saying it isn't a reliable tablet or that it doesn't function well
I wish other tablet companies would include things like that
most importantly about the tablet is that it's functional and reliable
lastly and very importantly it is relatively cheap
I hope you found this review helpful and anyway thanks bye
as promised here's my review of the wacom cintiq 16.
now let's get started so for the pen
the pen buttons started to feel quite loose
you have to keep pressing it until it does
each a pro of the pen is that
and i like how the eraser is as pen pressure to it
the screen is really nice and fingerprints or hand
prints don't really show up which is good
the screen also feels really natural to draw on
but that's just musing like i said earlier
i'm not really a fan of the whole pen sleeve thing
it doesn't feel intuitive or natural to me it's just not ergonomic at all
it's quite rare but when it does happen it's very annoying
look up references or even to watch shows whilst i draw well
i tried using the keyboard at first a lot of my keyboard shortcuts
i use a two-handed i found this rather finicky
i didn't want to change them so what i did
instead was i got a numpad i messed around with this
software called hidden macros but the software didn't work at all
you know the camera will be moving in each frame separately
and it'll just look awful so here i just bring them in
i made this using a tablet from gaomon now
they have this seven day offer on at the moment
it's got some good hot keys that you can
it's very simple just with the driver you can
you can put them to wherever you want
so i put them to like ctrl c ctrl v ctrl z
and so on um also the pen has quite a nice grip
you're not going to do that because you have this really neat glove
um with a tablet and it was actually quite cool
i don't know how i feel going for it
i don't know if i'll use it much or not
you know um but it was really cool that it came with the tablet
yeah here's some footage of me just initial doodle of technical blade
it's quite it's quite nice especially as a beginner tablet
it arrived really quickly and it is very accessible for newbie beginners
so yeah there you go and that's the video
it's it's only a little bit a month
if you can chip in anything i would be very grateful
you know and there's different perks and search for different levels
you can see this video on the side go watch that
oh also the animatic that you saw me making
that'll be on the side as well see ya
Ranjit from tech to bus comm and in this video
I'll be doing a quick review of this Samsung Galaxy
Tab 750 this is a 10.1 inch tablet from Samsung and to unlock
this is the lock screen and to unlock the same
I haven't inserted a SIM card in this
this tablet can take a SIM card to provide 3G functionality
it is very subtle and it's nice and as you can see
the operation of this tablet is really smooth
you can easily swipe between panes and it performs brilliantly
the interactions are done via these three buttons
the browser would load and at any given time you
let's say this is an open pane over here let's say
I want to drag the browser shortcut window
I just click here and I drag it and the shortcut goes over there
I click on the same and I leave there
I want to talk about is the actual screen quality of this tablet
so everything looks really great on this tablet
this is the standard web browser that you get with the tablet
me.com take also the on-screen keyboard is pretty good
I'm gonna click on the same and one thing I am really impressed about
this browser is how quickly it renders to their pages
let us go to tech to bus comm
I just click on the same and boom
just click on this pane and it just switches so it switches pretty easily
no problems with that also as this is an Android tablet it will support
what do you say flash without any issues so just let me
you get the optimized version for the tablets for the market and
it does not need to be a specific tablet app
go back to the home and let me show you the
the front-facing camera works beautifully with the same
according to me now let me go back
and this area is the notification pane for the honeycomb tablets
also you get a notification like you are
look to this tablet this tablet excels and actually
and hopefully i'm going to see you in my next video you
hello there and welcome back to the channel
today we are going to be talking about this
the dragon touch max 10 android tablet now in this video
display is housed by a small black bezel that runs around the side
on the right hand side of the device
you will spot the 5 megapixel camera with an integrated flash next to this
you will find the icons for each one telling you what they do
and there is a small reset button located just below the volume down
this tablet is running the android pi vision 9 operating system
i've added one or two more but it still leaves me plenty of space
so don't worry if you don't have one there is one with it
overall i actually think it's a bit of a bargain
i will put a link to this in the description of this video
if you've liked what you've seen please do consider hitting that subscribe button
i am really really impressed genuinely with this one
if you'd like to support the channel please do check out our patreon page
that's it thank you for watching and i will release another video again soon
now we have the 10.1 inch display right here
unfortunately the micro SD and the micro USB port
we don't have sound because we have the
I think for you and let's choose 720p but of course
interestingly the eye tell of course has the same
what actually would be the case right now so
Oh Google will find us but I don't care much then
said we have here a nice little email theme you already know that from
Android you can browse through your emails here
I will just compose a new one can type for example Julien
let's go to English and then we can write even long words like McDonald's
it's kind of hard for me to write upside down but at least
I missed that but it still knows what I wanted to write
let's see if breaking works actually as a husband if you already did
McDonald's tell the other company so we have borer and no
I think we have a 30 day trial here and then you can
of course see you can do a different things here and make it bold
maybe or things bold that you write you can actually make it even bigger
this is a simple editing tool of course we have the same thing for
Excel which is pretty nice and then we have the same thing for presentations
which looks like this so you can do your own
I think you should be able to select can I select the words
I don't know you have to use it
Toshiba 8200 which actually I forgot to show you with the iPad
also where you can charge your device and maybe do something else
I'm sorry for that and we have the New York
take much watching and till next time tune in again
you could rock it up and down and you can hear it there
and you can see that little micro SD card in there
it took twice as long to get it to fix him and micro-hdmi
USP tree read and write speeds again very good power
but you know really it is very good color
well looks great and and that so there's nothing really wrong there
I'm honest I didn't do much gaming on this unit
they're they've really come a long way and orti itself
it does feel like a developed platform and actually the only reason
try something a bit different and this table
but that's pretty much it the a couple of points one
Farsight touch to cover so it's illuminated and and it
the original touch cover was not as good as this it it
is you know this is very accurate you know
it's it just doesn't replicate like a full-size keyboard
and you know if you're looking now let's say use models and that
Atom stuff is like I've had the Dell Venue Pro Venue 8 Pro
I haven't had the the new 10 Pro and it was pretty
this is a polished product the office the productivity and all that honor is
Lumia I don't know I'll know next week anyway
my package is here today, oh hey there it is thanks
Disc, a little helpful booklet, a screwdriver to help us build!
I'm not quite sure what this one does yet?
That's a good feature HDMI cables, it's another cable
So they sent me this box and inside this box
there was another box and then inside that box there was a pen
Then they send me another box as a gift
What? They also sent me this glove which keeps me friction free
and that's my hand freeze in the chilling
You're gonna notice how big they're this is my hand on it and
Like this is like a size of line paper
That's a lot of space to draw on
this comes in handy because they sent you four screws
Okay, first of all just a friendly tip if you're upgrading tablets
So you can get drawn real quick first thing
you're gonna notice when you use this tablet
is you have a lot of room to?
Need to plug it in for like five minutes
And then it lasts for three days and with two pens
so you're gonna be super productive and you
Have a smudge guard glove, and I really like the glove
I can look at look how hard I could press
I got to give it a ten out of ten
So thank you very much and don't forget to
hey i'm ryan from technically well and i'm checking out the taj
atoll t 10 plus tablet at the time of this review
switching between applications was also very fluid with only an occasional hesitation
this is the e X Pro x1 7 inch Android tablet
I want to say that right off the bat
it's a 7 inch tablet which is kind of an odd size
I'm not quite sure whether we're going with 7
but they did a few things to mention on this tablet
I'm gonna mention the things that I don't like first
to be honest those are the two major cons that
I really don't like I'll show you the screen quality
so let's plus this guy open show you what's going on
they do a pink and they send me the pink one
this charge cable is your going to be your standard
so you are kind of intriguing one for the other
it only has half a gig of ram
applications comes but not playback or not actual execution
I'm going to power this guy on real quick
I guess you can recharge it that way
you're not gonna have to worry about that if you want to check out
YouTube it again will take a couple seconds to load up
well doesn't have any problems you know running
you can run 3d games on this now
it does take a few seconds to load up
I want hit jumps and you know it does good
it looks how that plays back really quickly
Beyond and we'll play it back and I'll show you guys again
this is me obviously not the greatest quality but you know
I'll switch over to and you can see
I can watch YouTube media consumption and it all works
Google now built into it so you can ask it questions
you can do whatever you want to do
it doesn't do such a bad job if you can
you know deal with a little bit of wash out there
the wash out on the the verticals obviously not horizontals
if you can deal with that if you can deal with no
Windows 10 and it retails for 240 dollars starting off with the design
inches with the 1280 by 800 display which is sufficient for media consumption
I would use this to take pictures on notes
there's a Windows logo which is actually Palmer
the keyboard is responsive for the most part
I liked a little flap to rest your hands on
and if you don't then you can always flip it underneath
I also tried to play a game on Steam
Dark Souls was the only game I had
I also realized that the 5 pin magnets are weak
this tablet is also packed with an 8,000 milliamp hour battery
I missed in the description as well as any diss count codes
it's plastic over here on the end caps
USB port here this does support USB host
probably in fact flexing which is a little weird
Arco seven here it is next to the iPhone force
Lib which is a customized version of an application download refer the device
it is not the fastest thing as you can see here
Wi-Fi it does have Wi-Fi 802 and EG since
it's about as stable as an elephant on rollerskates
half the time it seems to crash the device try to use it
Arcos used to be great about offering updates for the device itself
new firmware is but with the Archos 7
they're done see me any updates since this first came out about
I'm not sure we're going to see much
no too bad today only with the web browser
we suggest that you stay within relatively close range of your Wi-Fi access point
we are about 25 feet from our access point
Android menu button here so you press the little software menu button
that's up here to get your controls and here is the Android keyboard
because it's not capacitive it's not multi-touch display likewise with the keyboard
you really can't type with two fingers and do input because of that
Arcos players are good at which is multimedia
the video player on here does a great job
avi MPEG 4 stuff like that up to 720p
it will fast forward to a more interesting point of it movie
what you get on here is an alarm clock
you've got a photo frame function which is pretty cool
we'll take a quick look at the photo viewer
they're pretty fairly pretty good quality and you can scroll through like that again
I would say bring your charger with you
Android app has been around for quite some time
you want to read a book just have it
though it's much faster on a motorola droid than it is on this
Archos seven home internet tablet it runs Android 1.5 and
can we got ours from expanses USA as a review unit
there are some things that are attractive about it
visit our website to read the full review of the Archos 7
xB pen says the 24-inch unit which I loved
but they also sent us this brand-new 16 inch unit
so this is their brand new 16 inch tablet
I'm gonna do another drawing and let you guys know what I think
how this compares to the 24 inch unit which
just be able to make room for the 24 inch tablet
we go this is during this there he is he was really cute
oh whoa there's no feet on this one but this one
I think like you know it makes a good tripod
let's see let's see what kind of accessories we have here
this is the stand so mom take out right now
of course we've got pen in the nibs and for instructions
yeah so we're gonna try this one out
got a click wheel and everything on them all right
the car both colorable mascot model so I guess you can
I would be really roomis if I didn't
it's very much like a resin or something
but you're gonna have to fight your daughter for that yeah
so and she's supposed to be like bubbly
Wacom we reviewed this a couple months ago
so you can kind of see you know
there's a lot more drawing space on the 16 inch unit
Wacom this is how thick the 30 inch
lock-in is and it's a light unit and it's a really good local unit
you don't have to use a stand with it
it does have function keys on the side
you can zoom in and out very nice because you can you know
I had the same issue with the 24 inch
took me a little while to get this unit
I did hook up to our gaming laptop whereas the XP pen 24 inch
I think would fit comfortably into a laptop bag but I just love
this is very portable other than that and again
you don't even need the stand you can just take the the tablet itself
I had a really good experience wrong with this one
alright guys so here are my final thoughts on the innovator display 16
it's great it's actually a lot of fun to draw on
it's feels very much like drawing on paper or drawing on an iPad
inches the whole unit is about the size of a 17 inch laptop
it's thinner than the stylus that came with the 24 inch
XP now currently this unit is retailing for only 499 dollars
I love that you've got the function keys on it
I had no problems right out of the box
there was virtually no parallax at all on this unit
there's no lag loved it absolutely loved it now
again it does have tilt the interface is you
xB pin for reaching out and sending us this tablet
and if you want to join our community go to clownfish talk com
we will talk to you next time you
hello tile artists its talent here of course and we are back again today
a lot of you guys always asked me
tell her have you tried a human before should I get he won
he won this he won that and I was like whoa
I'm just gonna open the box first over here
I don't really need like an exacto knife or anything to open this
I probably should have opened it like this
I didn't even know it was gonna be like that
I thought this was the original box but I guess it's this one
I don't even know to be honest so it turns out
I do need an exacto knife or wait do I
yes oh my god that was such a workout
oh my god oh thank you for choosing huion huh what
whoa whoa whoa and on an off button no
I know has a not enough button is the Cintiq 13 HD
I don't get to open this part yet
whatever so there are about eight there are eight control keys
I'm just gonna put the size of the tablet on the screen
moving on there's the DVD instructions ticketing agent against it hmm hmm
I don't know what's wrong with me today
I can't do a normal unboxing like everyone else
I love how there's these little boxes okay you know
this is great because honestly like with the Cintiq
I just exaggerated that so much but seriously I love this okay
whoa this is really nice great job like
so here's how the pen holder looks says huion on it
it was just me kind of warming up
that's about 15 inches or 13 inches diagonally
I would definitely recommend going with this size
oh my god like it's a normal it's like
I did use my laptop on this so just let you guys know
you don't need a huge heavy hardcore computer to make this work
just a basic laptop will do just fine though yes anyway
better like you know in my painful size so I was like whoa Nelly
I don't even know what I was gonna say
oh yes so if you guys want to check it out
I think it's like 120 right now on Amazon
and that's pretty good for a wireless tablet for me
I got my welcome for like a hundred
this was like four or five years ago
you don't even need like the huge chunky piece to attach to it
just to make your wireless cuz it's already wireless to begin with anyway before
I don't know I really really like it
I don't really have any other words for it to be honest
yeah it's just like it just has everything you could ever want
it wasn't even the the tablet that was bothering me
because there's this and this wrong with you you know what
I mean there's nothing really wrong with it to be honest
so yeah if you guys are really confused as to what to get
that's the only way you can really judge and see if it's good
bye bye oh yes by the way guys before
we are doing the same today except it is a newer model
so let's crack it open and take a look again
i love the silver embossment on this one
it's just really pretty so let's check out inside here
we have the main board of the tablet
they just give you all these nice little extras and it's just
one also came with a really cool little
thank you note which i think is really sweet
let's set it up with my laptop and check it out here
it is all set up and i actually found out it
i post on a lot of social media
there just really helps me out and helps me keep creating content
so it'd be great if you could check it out other than that
and this is an android tablet and it's a big one
it's called the max 10 plus plus size model
hopefully this will be the business you can see
it looks like we have a volume rocker
the power switch and a three and a half millimeter headphone jack
that is like true blacks on that bad boy
i think this is just so big so what i want to do
i'm going to show you here that the back here
there are also two sim card slots there too
it makes it so much easier than a fingerprint reader
alright so i also want to show you that
as expected it has an accelerometer built in there
is maybe just a little bit of lag on
its responsiveness i don't know if that's pretty typical of android
the screen on this little bad boy is amazing so it is one huge
i think 10 inches here but it is just incredible in fact
part of this tablet is that the speakers are good
i've consumed a ton of video on here
i think it's going to be really really simple for you now
the last thing i want to talk about here is the overall experience
this thing is phenomenal and i would think at this price point
because it's a really high-priced piece of equipment
i think this is the one for you
so if you want to pick up this dragon touch
i think it's a really great big tablet
that's probably going to satisfy almost everyone's needs
i'll put a link to it in the description below peter
I'll explain why shortly so stick with me for that
I was surprised how well the tablet performed
this was a quite a lot of fun
this tablet is fifteen point six inches in size
I'm left-handed obviously but yeah you can see that
the tablet has kind of a greenish tinge to it
you know you can see on the screen recording
it's fully black but don't worry about that
a lot of that is my camera but yeah as you can see
also this guide to all of their other tablets came as well
we can see all of the specs and they're looking pretty good
I'm impressed that this has USB C is host powered the viewing angle
this works with Windows and Mac OS X now
let's get on to the unboxing looking forward to this one
nothing really fancy here but the case is nice and sturdy
it's gonna last you while you're carrying around that pen now
now let's get to the setup we can see straight away
they haven't used any of those old fashioned cable inputs
nice and quickly for me there so I was really happy with the setup
the colors straight away on setup were nice and accurate the one thing
well you'll get a lot of use out of this
you know there was some difference in variation but barely any
it was pretty good if you look at the tests here on screen
absolutely great moving on to the drugs first day
I spent about an hour and a half on this draw test
that one at the beginning of the video was about 10-12 minutes this one
I spent about an hour and a half on
the initial sketch for this was five minutes by the time
I can't say the tablet felt wonderful but the pen does feel good
I do think this is a great drawing tablet especially for the money
it's definitely a good tablet for the right person
I spent a couple of days tinkering with the color calibration now to me
don't be put off by the fact that my video is a bit greenish
I know his face looks a bit squished as well
that always happens when you're filming what you're drawing
let me know what you think below in the comments
is this a drawing tablet that sparks your particular interest
does this tick enough boxes for you for me
you know it gives you a variety of ways to work
if you're a student that means you could take this to university
I have to lean across my own hands to press hotkeys
this isn't so much of an issue it just means that
I don't end up using the hotkeys so much now for filming
it's okay because it means that my hand doesn't get in the way when
I do it if I was using the tablet without filming it
I did wonder if I put the wrong drivers in but yeah again
I just pre transformed the picture so he wasn't as destroyed and that looks
it communicated very well with the computer I was using
well a 15.6 inch screen for me personally
I know a lot of us more comfortable with a 16 inch row
they may only have the room in the studio for a 16 inch
I would want something a bit higher resolution like a 4k
and that's all that matters at the end of the day
I talk to a lot of younger digitalized
I ought to think that the tablet is the reason for the lack
I still only have Photoshop open or Corel Painter open whatever app I'm using
I still only have that one application open
face this is where really came to life me
I think but it would be more time consuming and as a professional illustrator
that's no offense to the powered life for me
also having tilt and rotate on my pen means
it's just about tidying up those other things that they could bring in
let me know what you think in the comments below
let me know if you like this would you think of the illustration that
what do you think of the tablet itself
what do you think of stylus or do you think that balling one cable
you could attach this to a laptop take it out on the go
you save money instead of buying a surface book or something
let me know what you think in the comments below
I can't wait to see what you think of this until next time
yeah okay so absolutely cool actually see you soon have a great there
I'm Dominic and I just wanted to make a video about the huion tablet
I bought the Huey on back probably in 2013
the customer service is not very good because you got to contact them through
and there's not really a number to call so to me
if you're going to get a tablet it might seem like a good deal
save your money wait longer get wake up now what
I'm using right now to ink this piece of artwork
I have never had any issues installing it
sure the next tablet i buy will be a
I don't even use it anymore every time I try to use it
Wacom so in my opinion for someone who's owned the Wacom tablet since 20
some one whose own I mean a Huey on tablet since 2013
today we do a tablet review for kalman
more than those that i just pen tablets
i've seen so far are those that are pretty heavy
built and basically cannot really fit my workspace
i feel like there's something missing with the package display
this would probably help first-time buyers a lot
the installation of the driver is not that difficult
the colors at default doesn't really match my computer
there started drawing and i find the screen very pleasant to work with
would the lines look clean despite not having stabilizer on
it was smooth to work with and i just love it in general okay
however is that there is no tablet holder to put the tablet on goldmine
you already have a full set of accessories
maybe you could add just one more to make it
i really didn't like the fact that it involves a lot of connectors
it makes my desk look a bit of a mess
it's light convenient and you can bring it everywhere
hello friends and welcome to another youtube video
i hope that you guys have been well
i will be reviewing three of their new drawing tablets
unboxing of me opening up all the packages
i want to say that i have been using a wacom
that was gifted to me by my uncle
and so i guess i will open them from the smallest to the biggest
one the tablet is so tiny and compact great for traveling
we got the extra nibs the cutest little notepad
okay let me one thing at a time
let's open this first okay so similar to the first one
uh we've got a adorable printed line play characters on there
we've got our line play branding on it
oh my this is the greatest thing i've ever seen
and i've watched a few reviews on xp tablet display things
so we got our guide another cute pencil pouch another glove some more
because i'm sure i'll get lots of fingerprints on it
okay so yeah we've got our nibs in here which is actually quite nice
yes oh ooh i like the the silicone-y feel of it
that's nice all right and on to the review
so first we're going to start out with the smallest one the star g640
uh you can't tell that there's even an image there it's completely flush
and so given its size and it's really affordable price point
but i would say that you might as well upgrade to a larger size
the smaller tablet came with one as well
i think because of the way that they die
i think that this is a great starting drawing tablet
it's a bit more on the shallow side in terms of the angle
i put it on because i actually had just put hand lotion on
so that was a really nice thing to have but overall
i don't think that i will really need to use the glove
most of the time and then here i just switched over to the screen
i'm just kind of fiddling around with it as you guys already know
some areas were super smooth and then some were a touch gritty
i don't know if maybe that was the nib or the angle
you don't have to worry about charging the drawing tablet or the pen
i found that i didn't feel like it was getting really really hot
um because it's so small and so light
i think that this is a great alternative
they're at and also at many different price points
we're going to be reviewing the XP pen artist 15.6
so let's get this thing open and actually before we open out
I thought I'd do a quick run-through on the technical specs here
I don't know if you guys can see that's probably not on the camera
the main box is a big white box sorry
so here's what it looks like in the box
see what's in here and this is an actual unboxing
it's all this black stuff on black background
so this goes to the power adapter according to the sticker
there's also it looks like uh it was at mini DisplayPort
maybe we'll see one of those fancy two finger gloves which
okay let's get all this stuff out of the way okay
it's lighter than I expected it to be
this little sticker says please peel off this mask
I don't know if I'll clear on that yet
I think since where I left you guys
turn it off and on again and after that
I did run the calibration software and that seemed to work
keep looking over at the keyboard to see what
the number is there's there's definitely this is only a 1080p screen
I'll try to figure that out too but the like on this device
I don't know how big of a deal that is
honestly you're definitely going to be what's where
I'm looking for like I think if you put this just on its own
I ever need to get you know when you're brushing
that's one thing or and so far so good
I'll get to the pros and cons at the end for sure
there are a few of both but for the price you know
I thought it was and I was looking at this before
I think that would probably be the equivalent
they didn't pay me to do the video
I kind of expected to be let down by this like a lot
I expected to find a lot of problems I really did and I'm just
I mean I'll go down my so pros and cons here real quick pros
it's extremely comfortable like it's got this sort of soft touch
it's really not so yeah three pros like I said the price I mean
for sharpness and image quality can ask my wife like
which is the distance between the pen and the screen
it seems like a lot relative to again what
I calibrate it it is because I calibrate it from my eye
there is some kind of protective film over it that
and and they they recommend not removing it
there's actually two films when you when you open this thing up
you tear off the first one that just protects and shipping
and then there's one that's like super stuck to it
I guess at some point there was a driver issue with that
which means it's a quarter of the pixels that are in 4k
s' there's no battery nothing to worry about there
it's going to be obvious that this is a 1080p display
whatever for you know magazines and that's your job
you know maybe that color gamut comes into effect a little bit
really you know didn't make much of a difference for what
I could see and my know my monitors calibrated that
I was comparing it to so they were
I don't remember if I mentioned this earlier
I don't have to return it but I wasn't paid for the review
any of that kind of stuff that they wanted an honest review
it is powered by a quad-core intel atom z3580
the keyboard is a small chiclet style setup
but it's a rugged sort of coating regardless that resists scratches nicely the t100
Wacom for a full review with all the benchmark details
welcome back to another video so for today
we've reviewed xp pen and now we're going to be reviewing article
artisol has sent me one of their tablets
article has not sent me only one though
oh gosh they sent me two of them
because i'm gonna be giving one away eat
i'm gonna be giving away to my instagram followers
only though so make sure to follow me on instagram
so yeah let's see if this tablet is good
alright so unboxing here you can see the box
let's see if the insides match and it does awesome
the first thing you can see is the warranty card for the warranty policy
then that pamphlet where it tells you to download the driver
while right below the tablet you can see a bunch of things
we have the smudge guard or the artist glove
in case it wears off along with the nib remover
one is a micro usb and one is a usbc then unpackaging
it has eight keys and a dial and below the tablet
okay guys so i'm about to test it on this phone right here
i tried this one but it didn't seem to work
um it kind of sought as a charger instead
i followed the instructions as well but still nothing happened
so i'm just testing this with my backup phone my old phone
i'm not sure why it's not working with my other phone though
so maybe it's just that but yeah yeah either way
it's just my issue but yeah it works perfectly fine before anything else
actually but it's kind of a waste of a shortcut key though
i don't really mind since i don't really use shortcut keys
well now let's get into drawing for the speed paint
that inspired me to use live cd and she is an amazing gadget
i swear we never and what is forever
feel it it's like i can't walk on the scene
the short cookies are really clicky and handy
i really recommend this tablet for beginners intermediate artists or even hobbyists
box below magic and that is all for the m0610 pro review from artisan
if you guys enjoyed the video be sure to leave a like comment
ding ding for more videos for more reviews probably anyways siege out love
this is brought to you by my weekly podcast
the we geeks podcast which you can find over at we geeks podcast.com
and you can't use your pencil in Photoshop
it's really difficult to sketch or draw with
Wacom sits on my desk everyday not sure how I'm still alive
I'm going to give it an eight and next up
first we've got the pen and pencil or the pencil and paper
I should say you put the pencil to paper
the functionality virtually literally drips off of a good tablet
I've used a mouse since I was three years old
if the results don't really need to be really really great
I'm going to give it a 7 now for the Wacom
I'm going to give this a 6 now for price
I was proved right because as I mentioned before this child of all things
Wacom tablet and why I would love to hear from you about this
make sure you go ahead and like the video
I would love to hear from you below that's it for this one
Athena Dodson touch vidcom catch you guys later
and today i will unbox and review the human inspiroi inc h320m
okay now let's open the box now and here is a little
okay now here is the cable for plugging the drawing tablet to your device
you are going to be drawing with these are adapters
also a wiper cloth to clean those spots and smudges on the tablet
it prevents your hands from putting those prints and spots on the tablet
one doesn't go into your device if both adapters
don't go into your android device plugging the cable to your computer
without the adapter should be your best bet
i would give it a solid 10 out of 10.
you guys have a great rest of your day
see you all in the next video bye you
and today we're taking a look at this
felt beauty is the Sony Xperia z2 tablet
it's really minimalist so the same deal with the front
you would think that would get in the way but it actually doesn't
your power and your volume rocker and up top
and we do have the micro USB charger port
you can pop a fingernail in there to open it up
this is really the star of the show here
I think has it beat but in terms of color reproduction
and that's because of Sony's triluminos screen technology in terms of performance
it's no slouch either since it does have the latest
Sony is obviously one of the biggest names in media and entertainment out there
whatever it is you're ready to move for all
I myself and very firmly in that corner
Stoney's is probably the least offensive like it or not
and that's that that's not just because of my face now
eg tablet is that it is dustproof and waterproof
it goes for about a hundred and forty five bucks on Amazon
I really wish they'd put USB see now this tablet runs Android 9
the colors are gonna pretty much stay the same
I said any angle which is always an awesome thing with a tablet
I played a game of this game already and it runs it fairly well
and it's not amazing but you would think you know for 145 bucks
you can do a fair amount of stuff on this
and it seems you know fairly decent for the time
it's a 1080p display and a five thousand milliamp battery
you know issue with any of that you can see while
the speakers are awful on this to be honest with you
I don't even know if you can tell but they sound awful
the speakers that the screen is very you know especially for the price
so you do have a headphone jack right here and I'll you know
they sound tinny they sound low they don't they don't have good volume
you've got your volume keys up and down
you get your power you get your headphone jack
you have at the top here the micro USB charging port
you have the two stereo speakers which sound awful and on the back
you have a camera along with right here
you can see that got a score of 239
Meg's download 36 upload and this was just know five minutes ago or so
and let's check out upload upload speed so obviously
I'm running it on the tablet right now but on my note 10
I'm on an android 9 Qualcomm Snapdragon 855
so we'll see what kind of score we get on the tablet
I said because that the the sound on
so it's good that you can plug in a pair of headphones
but again you can add more via the microSD security and location
there's no fingerprint or there is face unlock
unlock so just keep that in mind but it does that face and lock
I believe it's system and then you go into gestures
you can jump to camera by to quickly open camera
you can see you can press power volume up to turn it
I checked a few days ago when there was not again
you could use the speakers but they just sounds awful
you can do some gaming on here as well web browsing looks decent
you can open at up and open up tabs and stuff
so don't think you're gonna be available to you're gonna be like a multitasking
now let's see if you can run multiple windows yeah
I guess you can run multiple windows on here
what's up guys it's will from tech beat
this is of the wacom intuos4 bluetooth wireless pen and tablet for this video
kind of my overall thoughts and any downsides of the product
why don't we start and dive right in
alright guys is the review portion of the way
let's go into the actual pen tablet itself
if you do run into any issues you can be away comes of website
I was able to connect to my 27 inch imac relatively easily
I have other devices that are connected via bluetooth
I didn't get any skips or inaccuracies when using Photoshop or anything like that
it says it's up to about 33 feet
it was pretty good but other than that
select the brush tool and what you can do
you know lines based on the color template so
I'm going to go to maybe a yellow
it gets that deeper deeper markings on the actual Photoshop as you can see
so you know you can sketch out whatever you want
look but you can write pretty much whatever you want
whatever you really need so there you have it guys
and now let's go on to the finals section my thoughts on product itself
all right guys kind of going over the overall summary of what
it's the the nibs that were provided depending on
10 tablet is really just a nitpick has nothing to do with performance
fingerprints were magnetized to this section of high gloss right
I got closer to with usage with my normal everyday usage
instead that's from shutting it off turning it on cetera et cetera
if it's left on constantly it will drain your battery past
it's safe zone and what it will render your battery essentially useless
shut it off whenever you're not using it and you're good
you should be good to go other than that fantastic products
we're gonna unbox and test two things with this onyx
color device seven point inch eight inch color ink device
we're gonna look at the device we're gonna unbox it
good energy all kinds of productivity tips and just fun
this is a community more than a channel
i opened up the box that it came in
i wish they would put the factory screen protector on at the factory
this is i'm just not good at it
i i doubt i'll put it on here if i keep this
i may be ebay this product by the way i did buy this
um this is a not not a spent to product review
okay we have a couple screen protector accessories to get the screen on
we do have a sheet of paper from a google play
uh that's how to get the google play store on here
where like the remarkable 2 is more of a minimalistic or the super note
let's go ahead and open it up and take a look
the packaging is is decent as always with their products
it is going to be going up on ebay
so let's see i just want to see what the cover is
let's see and it is not a nice little case
it's not bad little you clip in case
i don't know if that comes with it from amazon or not
i want to get the initial stylus test
i did get some complaints on the ghosting from a couple of my subscribers
here it comes out of the the case and again another screen protector
i don't like to put on screen protectors please books
i'd actually pay extra you know i bought this device
i just think it's just a pain for some of us to put on
so here's the device um it looks pretty good the colors
so we'll see i'm going to power it on in a minute
it's pretty small but big and i don't have big hands
okay all right so let's look at what we got in here
which is the stylus and i have other styluses
i think that's got a little hole there for this
this thing that you can put it on there
we're going to do a writing test color test
um and that's where we're going to go so let me charge it up
be right back and we'll get on this okay
okay compared to the remarkable two and other styluses
uh this is just kind of a cheapy thing for 400 device
i wish books would do a better job
okay let's go ahead and look up here
uh than the the stylus that comes with it
um again it's pressure as you put more pressure down it comes
so let's go ahead and erase see if that erases
i don't know if it's really going to work
because as you can see i'm on eraser no wonder duh user error
um there's red you can kind of see red right and if i go
let's make it real thick here but for me
let's go ahead and erase all this and see
so if you come over here and refresh the screen again
too of kind of how they're going to work
i think they're still a little way from the color
there's black let's go ahead and go with a you know red color
i don't even know what wt means so i haven't gotten the instructions again
my reviews are just right off the cuff straight out of the box again
i purchased this as far as black and white looks great
one of the things i do like is the web browser on
it is pretty cool so i went and grabbed a video
let's refresh it's an advertisement on my video but you can see the ghosting
okay here i am talking so you can kind of see
let's go into regular normal mode and we'll move it
this device isn't meant for video but you can see there is
there is some stuff there and the color isn't bad
i mean it's again the ghosting you can see
and let's refresh this and we'll take a look at a webpage
this is my webpage and there's still ghosting on there
so a lot of people want it for comics and i
i don't know what these refresh rates are
but it's not anything spectacular like game changing and here's some books ideas
you can see a little bit of the color on some of these apps
let's see news and you can kind of see
they got a little bit of color to them
is it the the big game changer that i thought it would be
it's just do you want to spend the extra money on this device
2.5 i think they just need to keep working on it
it's it's fast and again when i take that and put that on now
nothing great all right so i just wanted to do this
something i would use probably not would i use it as a reader
i'm gonna try it but i think the ghosting's gonna drive me absolutely crazy
i might use it for some comment comics but even then
i'd stay with my kobo because it's just easier so again
this is just like a regular review of me
i don't know i'm gonna give it and i bought it
i'm gonna give it a week or two right now
and if you've got some comments down below if you're saying hey jb no
let me know but even in all the different modes
so if i'm trying to read something in color it's going to be hard
what do you want me to test on this
is there something you would like to know
is there a specific thing that you need for me
this is an Android 3.1 honeycomb tablets 10.1 inches and this
grippy does shows some fingerprints but not too bad
I think that guy out like so now
used as an entry duo sense display on the device
stylus the front is a little different most
the operating system is designed not to use buttons
maybe you'll like them on the side here
we have a little door that drops down some things recover the doors
except for your power button volume controls are over here and on the bottom
for some reason it covers the full-size USB port with USB host
mice flash drives we plugged in an unpowered
USB hard drive and it spun it up
this will also connect to the Lenovo ThinkPad optional keyboard
that we're going to show you in a bit that sells for $100
NVIDIA Tegra 2 dual-core CPU with a gig of ram
we do notice occasional slowdowns when using them
this is a quick launcher and because there's so much software on here
you can configure what you want each of these to do
but you can choose to assign gallery to that or something else
least they have different icons to give you a clue
the built-in gallery application does a better job playing
obviously your email and web browser in the middle we've got
all this utility does is let you copy
say if you've got movies or something like that so that's good
I wouldn't call this the most beautiful or intuitive interface
and all this going to do is copy
they say you should turn the display off if you wanted to charge
the three point to a little bit of a bummer there
scrolling is just fine so we have pre loading here
look if you want to sideload books lenovo likes card games
so we've got a bunch of card games pre-loaded over here hearts solitaire
spades euchre and mention em spot videos load if you want to rent videos
uh their prices tend me a little bit higher than average
slacker is pre-installed their social touch social networking which is basic social networking
because you've got this really big screen here so we've got Netflix loaded
Lenovo speakers and that's a good terms of size
Tab is so darn thin it's lots thicker
and you get a very basic interface at first with keyboard deployed
Lenovo's to make knows how to make keyboards really really good keyboard
we've gotten it slid into the mountain and you can see here
you've got three positions and it's firmly in placing now
you've got your your laptop substitute to go on the road again
you've got a dedicated number over here and a bunch of Android functions
ipad transformer here with the keyboard dock in it
that could make a larger keyboard and welcome both side by side now now
we compare the two keyboards as you can see the
they also have more travel and just more tactile feedback
CSUN that's a half cap of the screen twice
I'm not sure of this because of the enteric digitizer
this is not horrible but once in a while it will it happens
we're going to take a look at the web browser
inch display which is the same as age
60 online packs multi thread tests and about 32 on the single thread test
so it's pretty much average among honeycomb tablets
tablets won't even let you try to play 1080p
high profile standard profile and peg 4 is a lot
we've complained some about the software the excessive amount of software
I think one of those reason other than the usual
hey everybody likes to make some money is
subsets rather what you can find on the Android Market
who have watched our HTC jet stream Android tablet review
and there's a sketchbook pro that supports pressure sensitivity with this tablet
but did you just say that one color and you can see it
works very fluidly no skipping nothing like you see with capacitive styli
PDFs there's not too much beyond notes mobile but not small
you can select a word if you want
yeah honestly overall accuracy on this is about 70%
it is and does a nice job making your handwriting
look a little prettier than it really is
that's sealed inside the unit perfectly capable playing game since it's your standard
Nvidia 1 gigahertz dual-core CPU with graphics acceleration as well
even if lenovo's not thinking about gaming you can whenever you got some downtime
so that's the Lenovo ThinkPad tablet running Android with a 10.1 inch IPS
hello today and welcome back to my channel
I'm bringing you the RCA cambio two-in-one Windows 10 tablet
I'm sure they're gonna receive the same hardware refresh as well this device
you can pick it up for 120 regular price not on sale
I mean any device with a reset button is one that I just
I do not recommend the camera is I
don't know if you can see it but it's not centered properly
this is a reset button on the side of this device
you can have it behind a cabinet and you know it's just
the you know at the bottom of the barrel
Android devices you will not have this problem here
which by the way is not that bad anymore
you find in a laptop or like a mini desktop computer
but this thing is optimized to run high-definition videos
it sports a 2 2 megapixel cameras and they're of questionable quality
the screen protector is still on this device right now
it does have a 1200 by 800 display
it does not come with office with an office license
you will have to pay for office with this
it says on the box that because the word mobile Excel mobile
if you can like and get it right you can see underneath the jeez
RCA computer I never thought I'd see a RCA PC
because technically these are pcs in the tablet form factor
I'm actually going to swap it out for a
I just picked up a Black Friday sale on a Dell laptop
this is hack the planet have a great rest of your day
let's get this [ __ ] out of here
maybe i should have done this on the floor
let's see what i broke all right so this is the stand
actually this one looks smaller so and this one actually fits
obviously they want it to be bigger and sturdier
so we're gonna have to peel this one
so the tablet is supposedly 22 inches or maybe 21.5
you have your usbs and ah what's this thing
you also got your little donut holder your little poke ball
oh okay for the um the stand all right
i can fit two and a third of my cintiq's 13 in it
i'm probably just too used to my 13 inch screen that
it can become the engine of the pen display
it has chemically etched ag glass for visual performance
the screen also has less cursor offset than other tablets which is worth mentioning
there's no house light reflecting in it while you try to walk
it has buttons on the side and no eraser so keep that in
it doesn't wobble around at all but also isn't too stiff very sturdy
this is excellent and definitely one of my favorite things about it
a lot of tablet stands tend to wiggle on lower angles
according to the site these are the programs
i wasn't feeling how slightly it made my hand
this is probably just a me problem though since
one had shortcut buttons or express keys on the side
the canvas 22 plus doesn't have any shortcut buttons
also here's something that's just weird for some reason
unlike the canvas pro 16 this special graph is very adjustable which is nice
you can play around with the pressure level to your liking
i'm basic so i don't mess around with it too much in conclusion
i think it's good if i'll get used to its size
i may as well keep it as my main tablet who knows
thank you all so very much for watching
I'm going to review the Pablo is 6
Pablo the official retail price is us $79.99
the main selling features it physical chaka buttons
we have a big piece of microfiber cleaning cloth and one artist glove
USB data cable the pen blue quality is solid
stand that you can use to rest the pen
horizontally or vertically the remover built into the back of the stand
the cable actually goes here and as you can see this tablet
it's not too rough and not too smooth
I have also tested the tablet on Mac OS with driver version
we can assign shortcuts to to set buttons on the pen
the pressure curve can be adjusted manually by moving this dot
I have only assigned two so to switch between all these functions
I just put no action and now let's talk about growing performance
drum performance is excellent on both Windows and Mac OS
Illustrator affinity photo affinity designer clip studio paint
I can maintain consistent pressure very easily so the thickness for the lines
it's very predictable and I can press down
basically tap on a tablet to create dots like this
Photoshop a Mac is a lot more responsive compared to Photoshop on Windows
I'm only talking about it because I saw this on the box
I am wrong maybe there is to test sensitivity
I have tested except for Photoshop on Windows
where there is this lack where it's less than responsive anyway
Pro works perfectly on Windows and Mac OS but less than ideal with Android
alright thanks for watching if you have any questions
let me know in the comment section below
these are always a more affordable option than the more fancy screen option
and i find that they're actually quite enjoyable to use
fortunately though this tablet saved the day and works just perfectly on catalina
so if you are a mac user you don't have to worry about that
it is xp pens 15.6 inch screen drawing tablet and
it's become my main drawing tablet ever since i got it
i love buttons on my tablet whether they're screened or non-screen
that's totally fine which i think is really cool
i've used has had that though so if that's something you're really interested in
i've actually never seen that on any other tablet
that's why my very first tablet looks absolutely like brutalized
it's not like whittling down to a sharp point
i want to talk more about the innovator 16.
this tablet is kind of my dream tablet in a lot of ways
the stand is really important because with a tablet that's relatively large
um it also comes with a protective little case for your pen
i find and also the battery is going to make it a lot heavier
which if you're drawing for hours and hours on end that's really not ideal
it has nibs in the bottom which is really important
there were a lot of bonus goodies like these little stickers
juliana davis ume lilly john moscat snow white schmeichel hidden squid
ASIS the name of this tablet is called zenpad
10 model number is Z 3 0 1
M and it's an Android tablet now this Andrew
now he's a 10-inch tablet as you can see at the bottom
okay and that can be it can go up to 128 gig
millimeters Jack Poe and it has a USB type-c charge impossible at the back
he has a five megapixel camera and the logos
okay so it does have a decent cameras
and it's at the front as you can see this bit here
it's designed with sleek metallic edge and imposed a mere patent in his book
as you can see at the back okay got that qualities
whoa it has a rich display as well okay incorporating
I'm software between Wi-Fi only doesn't totally take em a member a SIM card
basically now as you can see is very smooth virtually
if you go to saying there's you can see
just don't think gig go in to use okay
the battery life is very good my opinion okay
will you all have been asking me for
a new iteration and a series of mine
ears friends i am proud to announce that finally after so long
the overall build quality of the tablet feels incredibly solid
but that's not a bad thing necessarily the stand itself as usual
however the rubber grips on it are very very solid
i never actually had any issue with the tablet stand from before
the tablet itself is as i said a 15.6 inch drawing space
it's a little bit annoying to deal with
that means that it's a very accurate color space
this is a small step up from my previous xp pen
i didn't have to adjust anything with my previous model
i had to fiddle with it a lot
there's a little bit more traction on the screen protector
it doesn't feel papery so much maybe slightly more plasticky
it's a little soft but it's not unpleasant
oh and the art of the background is of mumiji from touhou
but i did finish chapter 8 of my webcomic
which is about standard for every single youtuber on the site so bye
I think it's kind of unfair when you're paying $50 more for it
was really glitchy just crash and spaz on you thank you
which means you get a full 1280 by 800 pixels on display
just as you would with a 10-inch tablet from a looks perspective
it's kind of macho and reddish because well it is a
Droid tablet and it looks just like the 10.1
just nice pretty curves but if you look at the back uh-huh you know
Motorola likes to put their controls and interesting places
this is your power button and easier volume controls
they put them on the side on the edge
Torx screws and they actually are real screws
they're not just visual rivets or something like that
so let's take a look at the specs of the zai board this runs
Android OS 3.2 honeycomb expected one good upgrade to Ice Cream Sandwich motorola
nothing customized there no integrated motoblur or social networking
this has a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core TI OMAP CPU
that seems to be the favorite for for
it does pretty well in bench just at the 10.1
this is aggressively given the relatively small casing and the smaller battery inside
that's one of the big differences between this and those iboard 10.1
so you're obviously gonna get longer run times with the bigger xiphoid 10.1
it's a double either 16 or 32 gig storage capacities through isn't a micro
and here we have the the old motorola
we'll take a look at our file manager here and see what we see
you can get that for like half price
so you can see how it plays high profile 1080p content plays perfectly
you're just going to scale down but it does have that micro
that's this not quite as fast as a board 10.1 but again you know
it comes with or without a verizon contract
Zhai board and the other important difference is the active digitizer
and that means it's like a Windows tablet
it supports both capacitive multi-touch and an active pen
and not the 8.2 software bundles also a little bit different
now that some of those things can be downloaded here
I find it kind of sluggish and well
seems to be pretty inescapable these days but also very popular
it's pretty popular cloud notes syncing application and sketches for the drawing part
bundle in this since it doesn't actually have the active digitizer for pen use
that's the only custom widget on the device
which is pretty handy to keep track of
PowerPoint this this is the most full-featured version
let me just pick the video off the front page
it's showing what's on and you can choose your cable
TV provider satellite over-the-air that kind of stuff and you can also set location
this is what the controller grid looks like
they support quite a few brands of AV gear equipment
Talk video chat among other things and a 5 megapixel rear camera
10.1 does have better stronger reception though more room for an antenna
and don't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel
it's kind of a long story you know
I didn't know just no I didn't exactly play my cards right cards
come in please thank you help me my Asian Santa and like he
he has a present for you come in Santa
Oh [ __ ] I didn't order anything Santa not Amazon Prime
you freaking idiot if Miami asked you know what it is
it's that drying towel you've been asking for you
don't you know do me like that one poison
what a fine tip is actually kind of kind of pretty heavy and godsend
I've set my bottom is saved and my up is transform as usual
I can use this feature to write funny harmless little messages
there is a pretty neat hue on up
I was pretty on it in early 2019 as you can see from here
a lot of people say that my art is good except that
I guess that shows how negligent I am ah haha
so you can't really expect much from this you can see the build
quality is not the best and it feels very cheap
he's a seven inch tablet and it does have a rear camera
it has a speaker on the bottom left corner
speaker is not the best the quality as well
um it squeaks a lot here it takes a 3.5 millimeters headphone jack
it has the volume button and the power button
and that's about it so this is everything he has
i've skipped the registration i went directly to the main menu
um spin guess learning animals so it does have a few
you still got the remaining demand for but for kids
you only have to download a few games etc learning gaps
it's a tablet that's worth i'm going for
this is one of the most inexpensive drawing tablets you can find
it doesn't have an eraser and it's extremely small
which are the primary issues with this little tablet for the value
the look and design gets a four out of five as well
and it's an entry level tablet from a few years ago
I got it for Christmas when I was 15 years old
I was able to find a few on eBay
and the fact there's two ports for you to plug in your tablet
and lastly the field gets a 5 out of 5
and it's just a joy to draw on
it's a pretty small tablet and it has the same little fabric
they changed the little charging cord to an L shape
the design is really cute and I quite like the new buttons
I think the feel is the best part
it's super light and you can get as comfortable as you want with it
it's really nice that they had something to consolidate them
because yeah it's a lot of cords one of the big things
the bottom of this weighted pen holder is made out of metal and
it's definitely a 5 out of 5 on the value scale
I'm also giving it full points on feel and design
I got this as a gift from my parents
this is a very very interesting tablet so there are screen tablets
I believe to purchase but now because only refurbished models are available
you can find it for around half that price overall
and lastly it's pretty heavy to look around based on its original price
I'd give the value a 3 out of 5
this one was originally going to be a much earlier entry
it was sent to me when my channel was first really getting started unfortunately
it gave me some trouble with the chargeable pen
I hope you guys enjoyed it and I hope that
this is the tech tip guy and today
may be covering some loopholes and talking about some things about the next book
I feel like I didn't answer in the first video now
I cannot remember I believe I said in my first video
those are the rear facing is 1.3 megapixel
but they had said that you know the tablet is great
they had not had a problem with it
they are going to buy four more their family members
well you know that man let me let me say before
not all apps are going to work on any device
I have noticed there is a popular game fan
another little thing with this tablet is that
but the back on the device is sort of thin and also this device
I've noticed using it tends to get hot
and sometimes it can get almost as hot as an easy-bake oven sometimes so
I don't know if that's true for just budget
you know some of the budget tablets are all anyone
I do not know if it will do it or not
I'm going to try to power it off
I would say for $99 you are really getting a lot for your money
oh I know what I was going to cover fellas
there would be no software updates for this tablet so
so it has that option to update the software on this tablet
but who knows but back to for your money guys
it will more than manage to do that for you
I want to thank you for watching my video today
if you don't mind could you please rate my video and fellas
they were given to them as a christmas present by us
um i've been wanting to do it for quite some time
previously they'd had some leapfrog leap pad um tablets
it's obviously much cheaper than an amazon fire
because i think the game still had quite a lot to them
i suppose more of a more of a big kid tablet
um i didn't want to get the kids ipads because ipads are crazy expensive
and i i just feel like for a kid's tablet a kid's first tablet
i recommend you keep an eye out for things like black
kids tablet is this access to kids plus amazon kids plus so amazon kids
so this is one of the things that i really really love about
basically it's safe so there is a web browse option but only approved websites
i am the grown-up and this is all linked to my prime account
i'm not limited in the way that the kids app is so
this is what i really love about this
there's the adult element there so say you do have a child
she doesn't have my pin number and she's never getting it
she can't get that so all so her sort of whole thing
the only thing she can access is the stuff on this kids
plus app which i know is completely appropriate
all your child needs to do is tap to download
they don't have to do anything they don't have to purchase
that's one year free access to the kids plus app from amazon thereafter
if you have amazon prime it's one pound 99 a month per child
the thing that they've played with before they can browse through apps and games
barbie star wars disney all sorts of different things
so that makes it really easy for your child
um it's oh it's about 500 grams in weight
it has a port for um headphone jack
so just normal headphone jack to go in there
we have actually found that that does fill up quite quickly
you have to go log into your adult account
uh downstairs i don't let them have it in the evening
i've got one child's device there their user data one device there
i can even see what apps they last opened
so i know without looking at the device what they've been doing
these kind of arcade style tap tap repetitive games
i can specify how which parts of the device
say an hour a day so say you're feeling like well
i'm happy for them to read whatever they want whenever they want
so those are my thoughts on the amazon fire hd 8 kids edition
i really really hope that you enjoyed this video
I was at the mall with some friends today and I was at Best
so here we have the insignia 10.1 inch flex
because we know we're gonna fill up 32 gigs pretty quickly camera
I wouldn't be skyping with anybody on this camera
USB type-c port and micro HDMI port other than that
let's go ahead and open it up okay
there is no tape for this this time he's gonna go ahead and just
I think this is the way they want you to open it there
we go and of course we have get these out of here
we're just going to go ahead and just sit this aside
there's one more piece in there but we'll get to that in a moment
why not you know where this is going
you're not much to see you know you got your charging ports here
it looks pretty sleek and I can see where it connects to the laptop
I'm kind of feeling this I mean for for $80 for $80
this was not a bad deal and then
I just believe this just kind of goes in like that
I finally got to tablet up and running
of course you can't see it here but isn't right on par with something
the internet is fairly fast as long as you use
Windows OS the tablet also comes off the keyboard and plugs back in easily
thanks to the prongs on the keyboard itself of course
the keyboard is smaller which can make it harder to type on
update is ready for your new tablet which is great too
the tablet is still supported for newer updates
there's just one big problem upon trying to install the update
you will need a lot more space than you already have on your tablet
I know being a bit picky about the lack of any real storage here
unless of course you're in the games like candy crush not that
Like and subscribe if you did until next time this is your old pal
i got a charger a 5 volt charger uniform and a mini
now let's see this device has a place for your earphones
a microphone for mini USB cable place and a micro SD card holder
and this is the place for your charger on top
the volume up/down button and back button so let's unlock this 9 there
we go so this is the home screen of a tablet
this tablet is great for playing some simple games
this tablet and watching photos is also quite smooth
what I found with this device was when I use the net
this is a great and a moderately priced
hello director this is a review of the new tablet
one and it's canon tablet is specifically the b3 a 40 model
these two models of this is the black model
I've been using it for about a week now
although the speaker grills are not or a bit misleading
and if you're holding it like that you do cover it up which
I don't like having a lot having the things like that
so that's what that's one of the bits in it
I had the odd lag on the home screens
where you switch into it like that but once you're in games it's okay
just mainly boom beach and classes are really likening
Wi-Fi so you get good speed out of it so for its price
yeah so that is the Acer Iconia one
I got this towel a few months ago
it's got this blue a plastic cover on the back
we got a camera up there in the center
this one has the upgraded 9 20 by 1200 resolution screen so
I do like the screen on this tablet
it's not as high-end as some of the other screens
I think it originally came with Android 4.4
gotcha is a little bit different than other operating systems on android OS
if you just double tap on the screen it'll turn it back on
I just got a set on standard view right now
as a matter of fact you can turn on and off dynamic contrast
initially there was some problems with sort of the
I think was the volume level or kicking in so if I would kick
even at full volume they updated this like a month ago
I went ahead and just customized my own
some other things you can do in here
there's some different security options in here one thing
remember somebody asking about apps you can save apps to your microSD card
you can actually set it as the default location if you want to
install the iPhone a text-to-speech because it sounds better than the Google text-to-speech
there's this weird high contrasting um makes the text kind of darker
numbers should be done here in a minute
34 376 is the number for this tablet
a store score came in at 12 560
okay so the tablet has GPS as well
it's just not in it's not just a fake
the only downside with the screen is is
it does show fingerprints a little bit more than probably some other screens
so as far as performance everything seems to run quite smooth with this tablet
HD movies play wells go ahead and load up this HD movie
Play Store taste nice and shoot very clear in HD
I think that one came pre-loaded I certainly didn't load it
where's that the real so this game doesn't play plays without a hitch
there's no issue with it with performance whatsoever
I don't know anytime I try to take
pictures almost always comes out slightly out of focus
I mean I don't know it does the job but it's not that great
I mean the iPads that I used to have the iPad air in
its camera definitely was clearer than this ones camera is so one thing
I wanted to talk about with PDFs on here
I kind of like the two column PDF layout on the Google Play
it's going to cut off to scale the PDF is going to cut off
there's just a big black space right here
I kind of like how it handles PDF
I mean you don't have any sort of hang-ups or anything like that
you do have an occasional you know slow down here and there
everything's nice and zippy so comics the layout really nicely in portrait view
I'm gonna go ahead and wrap up this video right here
check out the e-book reader comm for some additional information
thank you guys for watching and you guys have a good day
but everything's getting back to normal now and everything's working so now
it once again is the Acer Iconia 1:8 tablet that I purchased at Best
this is just something that I purchased at Dollar Tree and it really works
I can go ahead and use the tablet maybe watch some Netflix
b1 - 850 this is the 16 gigabyte
Wi-Fi only model so no 3 or 4 G access
this will only work on the internet via
Netflix basically do all the basic same things that I like to do
1 gigabyte of RAM now this is where I thought it was gonna struggle
but as you will see it really works well in this light
in this tablet it does have an 8 inch
IPS screen 1280 by 800 so this is a 720p
HD screen resolution is perfectly fine once again for what I need now
I would highly recommend getting something that has a little bit higher resolution
the cameras on here are really not not good for anything than your most
the front-facing camera is good enough for Skype
I would not vlog in or anything with it
I must say the battery life on this is excellent
I was very very surprised at how long it lasted
I believe is just telling you how to set up your Google account
the rest of the information is built into the tablet itself
this is just basically telling you if you have any questions just contact
Best Buy and I think that was about it
the touch the touch capability is very good
I'll go ahead and activate it real quick
I'm going to go ahead and clear because I've read most of these already
of course it's gonna have to play in ads first but here we go
I kind of regret using that picture yesterday
but yeah whatever yeah so as you can see
it's just using the one CPU because we're basically only running CPU Z
if I scroll over here you can see some of the different information here
DPI that's the screen density total of 970 megabytes of memory
and of course because it is android 5.1
it does use quite a bit of that so even just
these are just some of the different versions
that's the one thing that drives me crazy with these
just got the one accelerometer sensor so like
I would highly recommend getting something like this because for the 60 70 dollars
you can see the various buttons on the side here
which is above the volume rocker very very typical design
I like it on the top here you have your headphone jack
next to that is the micro USB charging port
I'll go ahead and pop that out real quick and show you guys
PNY card so nothing super fancy but that means with the built-in 16 gigabytes
I have a total of 32 gigabytes of space
get out lies and gentlemen welcome to draw with Gaza
I also asked if they would set up a discount
I never do anything for you because I just did
coupon code is helium to 20 and is valid until the end of
and how easy was it to set up
I'm gonna say through the process of receiving and then setting up the device
they also sent out the device with the screwdriver
the pen came charged enough to use from the beginning but also
Bose over 800 hours of continuous use and to be honest
I know it's a limited period of time but I do feel like within
in the option for the button functions on the pen which
US dollars the question is does that price pay for the performance and functionality
so that's my overall impression of the huion
GT 220 I hope you enjoyed this video review
you'd like to see me review in a future video
thanks so much for watching ladies and gentleman and until next time
make sure to subscribe to my channel for new content every week
thanks for joining the arty party and until next time
I spend about 40 bucks on it probably
I mean it's okay like I said I still think it's a little overpriced
it came with some pre-loaded stuff so I'll just turn it on here
it's a little bit slow its but again
I'm not looking for anything fancy I do like she discovered this
I don't know if I'd really let them do that
I mean we have a TV but for road trips and stuff
this is really really cool that they have this
you know pre-loaded stuff here you just need
it's not like your fancy phones or like for a 20 month all okay
this entertained here for a good 15 minutes so not bad you know
this is all pre-loaded on it and then the games see some art
I haven't learning notes so this really isn't art
I mean she doesn't really follow along with it but you know that's okay
what's another one just lay out kind of see educational games games
okay so the other games here educational games
I think are pretty much you have to maybe pay for
she liked this to see what this one is
you know a lot of people were kind of knocking it and stuff and
I don't really know what kind of expectations they had
oh yes it does that it glitches a little bit but you know
it doesn't cost a whole lot of money
it just depends on what you're using it for this for my you know
infant to toddler kind of age group and so
I'm gonna go ahead and oh yeah there's some like little stories and stuff
yeah and get it in pink or green
this is the vulgar prior pad x 100 10.1 inch android tablet
let's take it out of the box in the box
you have your power button volume up and down
there is a front camera and a rear camera will get into that
now before i show you the actual tablet on and working
and we'll swipe and it'll wake up and here's everything you need now like
do you want to go ahead and restore that i said yes
and there's all my apps just like that bam
go back in your bag and for games
you know this will run anything you can get from the google play store
everything seems to work exactly as it should obviously like
you can see playing a game like this quality is there
it does everything you need it to and that would be it
it has all of the options that you might expect from an android device
you have full access to the google play store
that's the main thing i have no problem using this as a day-to-day tablet
it feels solid and sturdy all around really a nice unit
here is a still picture taken using the front-facing camera
the resolution of this picture is 1600 by 1200 netting approximately 2 megapixels
now here is a picture from the rear facing camera
the resolution of this picture is 3264 by 2448 netting approximately 8 megapixels
these photos were taken in the 4x3 aspect ratio
the tablet can produce pictures in 16x9 format
but that will make the front and rear cameras effectively 1 megapixel
these photos were taken in the 4x3 aspect ratio
which in my opinion is the correct aspect ratio for photographs
here is a video from the front camera recorded at the maximum resolution
i'm now recording a video using the front-facing camera on the vulgar 10.1
and here's a video using the back camera
this big is not something that you're going to really be recording video with
inch tablet seems to be a great deal
i've had a couple of those over the years
generally those are like your quote-unquote bargain basement
units out there but for something like this
it feels well built everything in it is adequate
tablets are one of those things that a lot of people have them now
make sure you click like make sure you click subscribe and take care
reporting for the best bi can at a plugin blog and this time
the smart tab features a 1024 by 600 resolution
finally a clear removable protective case is included
and it's just like any typical smartphone case
quite well so this thing really has a whole lot going for it
the read and learn section has 15 different story books
Disney's froze and it's on there and this fun little Spider Man story
you can pretty much draw whatever you like
I actually enjoyed the shooting gallery game quite a bit
which is exactly what we'd expect a carnival-style shooting gallery but the one that
I'm showing right now is called Prague poppin
so that's it for now as always this is
Leo bond saying thanks everyone for watching and have an ex one day
Melling back here and I have a review today for Rey
a lot of surface area for drawing and also included is this
I feel like I have to keep pushing down super-hardened like you have to
I think you guys should check that out
I want to make more videos where I'm drawing it stuff so anyway
it really means a lot to me when you guys do that
and of course you're the best people ever forever
this android tablet is only available in black color but matrix pad z series
if you want to with this matrix pad z1
cover on top of it and is a very lightweight
connect your tablet with wi-fi by typing in credentials
connect your tablet with wi-fi connect your tablet with wi-fi and it supports 2.4
it only took me a couple of minutes to configure this tablet completely
and it's all up and running now over the tablet
you also have a google play store from here
where first to start with you have a google assistant
if you set it up you can use it on your tablet calculator
now let's check out the video output performance
actually that's a maximum on this tablet for the youtube
isn't that bad at all if you consider
uh and performance of tablet 2 megapixel camera
i suppose now here i have all the pictures
just been taken using the camera on this tablet
that shouldn't be a problem at all within the settings
and so much more in here and the response
time of tablet shifting from portrait into the landscape
seems to be pretty much fast as well
this video shall see you soon into another one bye for now
some of you might remember that about a year ago
I reviewed the huion GT 220 V 2 tablet but today
I'm Jazza and in this unboxing slash review
I'm going to divide this video into sort of three chunks
I'll sort of go through some of the specs with you in this video
Perot as how you know that's professional because it's pro
this is a really inefficient way of doing this
but at least it looks cool and we unsheath the box
you get a double of the boxing today
lucky you two boxes in one bloody day
we have with a third box without general cables a few screws
I have never bought a tablet device that came with a smudge guard
it's just got a little bit of that storage dust
so let's clean up our lovely new screen here
last time it took me about 10 minutes to set up the stand
so let's see how this one goes it's same
I don't want to wreck the screen but I do have to flip it
I've never had a problem with to be honest
I don't even know why sped nibs are a thing
I've never replaced a nib in my life
but hey better safe than sorry what do we get
cool that's unique a spare pen very interesting now
I can actually think of useless for that
I actually have lost my stylus pens in the past
so that's probably the real reason they give you free pens now
I thought it was kind of cool anyways
they're easy for you to download for Mac or PC download extract install
drivers are officially installed into your GT 221 Pro
I also recommend experimenting with until you find something satisfactory
I like something sort of second from the bottom
all in all it was a really fluid experience actually surprisingly powerful considering
I was using this device running off of a laptop
you're viewing at the specifications also boasts a quick response
time specifically a 14 millisecond response time which for a digital tablet
that you're drawing on is pretty nice now as you can see
there are a total of 10 press keys and touch bars
some people love these and some people preferred the keyboard on the lab
I tend to be a bit of a keyboard on that kinda guy
you've seen all of that but the goodies
the specifications rattled off what matters most at the end of the day
is the experience creating art on the device
that's a bit of a bummer for me
so that's my feedback to hear on the other minor problem
I have a spare and even more affordable with that five percent discount
the first that was actually quite noticeable to me is the build strength
I guess to best summarize how I feel about a device like this
let's sort of use the analogy of a cake right
you see behind me in the space of two hours with this device
by its reaction time and responsiveness the pressure sensitivity once
I could do within two or three hours now
I mentioned before about the lack of the double-click and the slight funniness
I don't know what I'm so focused on cakes
Pro today was delightful and I can definitely recommend it to you
thank you so much for watching ladies and gentleman and until next time
Jazza that's it for now and until next time I'll see you later
so here's the device itself that i it comes with a screen protector
that has some shortcuts which is pretty useful
it's kind of like i'm sat in a velvet
um i'm gonna do a testing for you
so thank you guys for watching and enjoy this video
um if you don't have a proper computer that is equipped enough to handle
you may experience lag and this is not our fault
it boosts the algorithm and remember to leave a comment just comment down
and what do you enjoy drawing and ask them to subscribe
we post art related videos on this channel uh you
no wonder usually dogs are scared of that right there
oh no okay so this is the on button
meats whatever that is if you go on this
oh my gosh you're purple so that's basically it
there's a cap in front to protect the tip
this cap is not able to go to the back
the grip section is matte surface does not attract dust
there are not a lot of accessories included just the essential ones
K is a budget tablet from gum on the build
there are 12 physical shortcut buttons on the site
the texture on the drawing surface is matte
I have already installed the driver so now
he watched shortcuts to the 12 physical buttons
you cannot assign control option and shift to the physical shortcut buttons so
this pen has 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity
the tablet is going to map on 200% of the morning
the transition between a thin and thick lines is very smooth
let me show you how smooth it is
so we have some other brands of tablets
let me zoom down to 100% so this are how the lines look
they are very smooth and a deeper white gradually the overall performance on
this is illustrator cs5 now for some reason when
and they say that these may work with cs6 or newer versions
so just at post cs5 it works on and off not just that when
the strokes the taper very nicely as well very responsive very smooth
this is a re sketches pro pressure sensitivity
that's because of the style of that particular brush
let me draw some thick lines by pressing down harder
you can let me know in the comment section below overall
I would say this is a pretty decent budget tablet
I think this is a really decent and capable tablet
reveal the link will be in the video description below
see you in the next video I you
we're gonna be looking at the artis you'll be 13s before we begin
also if you would like to kind of help keep it supporting me
alright so the audio for this footage actually gotten that stuff so
I'm gonna have to do the voice over you can see here
you have a bunch of information that you can read off
that has little adapter so that you can plug this thing into the wall
this is the stand which is really nice
I'll show you how this gets set up in a little bit
next up we have the obligatory container that has the glove now
we'll do a ruler test all that kind of stuff and while
Express keys a completely battery free pen that comes with two
so you will get a fit of parallaxing
I did the obligatory ruler test from what you can see
the display and pen had almost no wiggle at all
while drawing slow diagonal lines definitely one of the cleanest displays
things like not having the type see as one
connector is kind of a downside to me
I wish they had it all in one plug
I know a lot of tablets can do that
make sure you do some research you know
I think depends on if they have it up in the Amazon store
if you haven't to stay up to date with all my stuff
there are a few things in the box for you to go through
you also get five double-sided coloring in pencils and a black tracing pen
so the pen itself is quite nice and fine
I won't be using it today or just if I don't really need it
there's three different brightnesses and all you do is just here in
the top corner is a little power button
you can what the way that I would do
you can then get something like washi tape
so washi tape is that it just removes really easily with no residue
I do them from scratch but there is a way to do it
while you're learning that the light pad makes very easy
it comes with a few copies of this piece of paper
point of your star so very easy to do with the light
your lines geometric shapes purp you know petals and things like that
so now that we're done you can see
I then got a compass so we had used to have them at school
if anyone's done any of my drawing lessons you know all about circles dots
I'm just making this up as I go
well okay look so pretty so you can make this oh sorry
so that's the advantage of the light pad - so
I just realized but again what you want to do
you can then continue like you could decide you
or you can turn it off and continue to do that on your own
so now that we've had a play in a draw
it's really cool and give it a thumbs up
it's actually a bigger screen than the new
the tablet to sleep is set for 30 seconds when
I'll show you how it sounds right here you can see the sound
it's a squirrel that I rescued and fast in the air
it has really good quality with the photos
also and it's very quick and responsive you can see here
let me turn on the camera as you can see it here
it's also pretty lightweight and it has that nice color
I actually got a case for it right here
I've got a USB charger also or you could plug it into the wall
and here's a tablet in a true case here
here for a mini SD card you can have up to 64 gigabytes
it turns the screen off and you open
which they're the third largest manufacturer of laptops
you'll get this pen tablet with a big hello from brown coney and sally
i got stickers and sticky notes and a ruler slash
what's left in the box are the micro usb cable and some paperworks
i add a bit of chaos here and there
the box includes the pen tablet with 8 buttons
and there's brown coney and sally so cute
this one has an expansive work area measuring 10 inches by 6.25 inches
this one's only eight millimeters and also includes its own translucent protective film
adorable time to put it to the test time to color
i'm not an expert when it comes to coloring
i don't know color theories and principles and stuff
this is a great choice for working on the go
dial is one of the best features in a drawing tablet out there
and it has brown in the middle cute
drawing on an artist 12th row feels like drawing on paper
microfiber cloth usb extension with power adapter and adapters for different countries
stand it's so cutie pie look now time to put it to the test
now i'll add my favorite part adding what harris calls as the worms
the problem with that is it just couldn't compete with an actual pen display
xp pen gave me one of each tablet to give away
i'm giving away three never-before-opened tablets to three of you guys
include a brief description of your artwork and your instagram handle
don't forget to follow exopen and myself on instagram
so if you want me to share your artwork just post it on instagram
but don't forget to send it on my email
thank you to xpenn for making this video possible
make sure you have a great day bye bye
So usually I give a tablet away at the end of the video
I have three Artist 22R Pro Tablets to give away
Stick till the very end of the videos to learn how you can win.
So this is the Artist 22R Pro, first impression:
My favorite part is always the removal of this plastic film.
This one definitely feels like a more premium product.
especially when you have a beautiful product like this, it doesn't really correlate.
As long as this works and performs beautifully then I can forgive this.
for: is that it requires one cable to hook up to your computer!
I mirrored the displays, let's open up my Photoshop.
Course Series, this is Faye's master and I love the quality of it!
Oh, it looks so great, look at that!
I'm sure if you guys are watching this you are deciding
Is this better than the Cintiq or vice versa, you don't know.
So the 22R can be directly compared to the Cintiq 22
million colors, it's the same amount of pen pressure
(8,192), has the same exact screen size (21.5"), same exact resolution (1920x1080)
Ugh! Which brings me to the best part about
this tablet is the price point and it retails for $699!
That's insane! $699 compared to the Cintiq 22 which is $1199.
So spec-wise, overall, on paper, as of November 2019
Which I feel brings super healthy competition to Wacom.
Wacom is like the king of tablets, right?
I've been waiting for that but hopefully, I don't know.
One really big improvement about the 22R is the pen.
You know what, let's have her in the clouds.
I'm just kinda gonna drop it in and see what we can come up
Look at that, this really helped me find the mood.
Maybe I'm gonna try to add this cloud back in
Somehow, you know just maybe like a little bit?
Now it feels kind of like, like a bright midnight in a way --
You can keep trying new things until you find the mood
I don't think I've ever studied what bats look like
But I think no video is complete without some color dodge!
And then one awesome big light bloom- Aaah!
Welcome back! This is Amé, I really enjoyed this piece.
Best thing is its affordability, it is significantly cheaper than its competition.
And see what's the best one for you.
and if you don't like it, you can return it.
Now the moment we've all been waiting for.. The giveaway! Aah!
Rule number one: follow XP-Pen on Instagram and Twitter, rule number
Rob here and with me is lenovo flex 3:11 inch tablet slash notebook
you're going to see it for less during this holiday season
I was speaking to you in the end of November of 2015
so that's what you'll see it on the shelves
there's no reason on earth that a laptop in 2015 or probably 2016
when you're watching this should ever be two gigs
I'm going to get a touchscreen and I'm going to get a two gig
touchscreen laptop no get them without the touchscreen
I'm saying that I don't hate this device
ISO pose I will quickly go through the multiple modes
I've got photos of it in the multiple quote modes
it's well if let's mention our multiple modes first
there's laptop mode which is a standard laptop
we'll talk about the screen stand mode which
so it's actually pretty decent in this mode
so you can basically in tablet mode the keyboards facing down
you should of course immediately do that before you even touch the thing
Windows 10 so upgrade yourself to Windows 10 if you get one of these
I talking about I was going to talk about construction then
I will talk about ports and such so
it's not too heavy but it doesn't feel cheap and light
that is not fake that is actual brushed blushed
it's blushing brushed aluminum very classy on the other hand
if you look at the screen it's impossible not to notice that gigantic bezel
it's huge like look at that bezel on that thing
it's yeah it the bezel is too big it
I do like the screen when I'm looking right at it
the keyboard if you look at it it is a very flat keyboard weight
that said you know what after a few minutes of typing on
I really like it I I like just
not a bad keyboard at all doesn't feel bad
I wish I could say that for this right here
this this little guy is it just feels cheap
you can hear the click but it feels shallow
I did mention earlier that it was a 500 gig hard drive
so this is a mechanical hard drive 5200 rpm
it right away it also comes with an amazing amount of circus
Best Buy or something is one of the few times
I wouldn't be running battlefield on this though
I don't think I would be planning to do that anytime soon
I've had absolutely no lock ups with it it doesn't get excessively warm
I'm stressing it so that's really nice and it's very quiet
well let's go over the ports on this side if you look right here
there is a third on the other side making it totally acceptable
Ethernet port you need you notice they can can talk to you alright
I don't think yeah I did bring it
okay this is what the power connector looks like
here and right here is a button that locks the screen position
you don't have to do it in software
I thought they claimed ten hours on it but I in actual use
I think it has enough ports it has three USB ports on it
it has a pretty large hard drive for this range
I think it is great for work light duty home
it's not going to be a gaming machine by any stretch of the imagination
but you know you can play a little bit on it again
I think you'll enjoy this laptop quite a bit all right
operating system it comes with a anal company
and this is a 7-inch capacitive screen tablet
it has got a 1 gigahertz processor and 4000
so let's start with the unboxing of the fabric
there is a microSD slot here the 3.5
and this is the mic for visual aids for the video video calling
these are the volume black keys and is the reset key
this is it can be used to by inserting a small pin on it
like icing on the enola novo7 need to hold this
these are the multiple home screens sacrifice to Dustin
you can see the interface of the app
pages are shifted going to settings to check the firmware
it won't be anything hard for them to start up with the device
it's not a pretty by device but we like the iniquity option of 3g
but let's find out how good they actually are
but it's certainly more than passable with great colors viewing angles and brightness so
but we'll get to that in a sec
the camera around back of both of these tablets is extremely basic
it's a 5 megapixel fixed-focus shooter and no LED flash like most tablet cameras
but it's a nice secondary option if you really need it
Lenovo's camera UI is just as basic in bare-bones as the camera itself
there's a few basic shooting modes like panorama
HDR and beauty face but nothing too unique
that's worth mentioning if you're planning on uploading these photos to social networks
as far as zooming and cropping goes and photos
I'm a pretty heavy user when it comes to tablets
I was hoping for between 7 to 8 hours but on the positive side
losing only between 1 to 2 percent overnight
Lenovo keep these tablets up to date even if they are mid-range tablets
there are some lenovo customizations namely the custom launcher
but you can't actually use it for multitasking
because you can only get to it when you're on your home screen
the good thing is lenovo does give you the option to disable it
they're actually better like the front-facing speakers and the higher resolution camera
thank you so much for watching this review
in the right corner there is small white
tablet feels very strong and there are no plastic conscious when bang
nice printed and all the buttons and ports on label 19 near bottom
there is darker plastic bar with no functionality
a birth weight is 375 grams and the thickness is nine point
two millimeters screen ratio is around four by three
let's sight is empty and look right there
applications will work good and observe is pleasing experience given the fact
installed we will install desktop applications and run them with no problems
Lightroom and it worked fine for basic use but not for professional work
memory is low and in run with hard drives which is disappointing
system is running smoothly blazing fast between applications in
it's the brand-new welcome into his pro small
they don't need a battery so never have to recharge it and notice
we'll get a little base for it here
we've got 10 spare nibs no different types of nibs for different purposes
then we've got a table comes with a nice rubber tie
good thing about this cable couple of things one
it's a nice brushed aluminum with rubber feet
here nicely built same quality as in the medium and the large
there's no wrong way to plug it in
get it out of the way so right
so it's an ambidextrous tablet one of the other things
they all work with the pro pen - they have the
I can just take it anywhere with me
in fact it's about the size of an iPad
let's hook it up to a computer now
this blue light flashes on and off means it's in pairing mode
let's choose connect now says it's connected and we can see on a screen
everything is connected all right and we can see our window comes up here
we can import our settings from the medium
we can turn the touch and gestures on or off now
these are actually something that we do on the side of the tablet
let's just go next and we're done so this is the Wacom desktop Center
don't install the driver or they have an old driver features
we're going to go under our settings and here we are inside the settings
so we've got our touch options we've got gestures
it doesn't have to just work as an eraser
there's a lot of different things we can do
I only have to go here so now
and they wear out their tablet here in this corner so if that's you
I would recommend remap it to different areas
I don't think there's so much need for you to map it you know
OK and now that means from this corner is the corner of the screen
this corner is the other corner of the space
you have full flexibility the way you want to orient your tablet okay
so let's look at the first ones the most obvious ones are
that's what these are set for and we can change them
we can do different settings on the tablet precision mode
and we're gonna call this undo and now that one will undo whenever
we can specifically set these for programs so notice
a lot undo redo different things like that and in the bottom ones
what's out having to reach over the keyboard all the time
I can do a lot of that from the pen
let me show you on the pen here
click and we can do these keyboard shortcuts all these things
some people like to sit the forward and back button and sometimes
alright so we can set this to do different things
let's just talk about basic pen pressure right now
so why don't we go down and we're gonna grab our brush
we'll just get a regular brush here and this is our brush panel
this is how we get into our different brushes
we're gonna get a different thickness see as I straighten that up
I like to use the most is transfer and opacity
so let me just go to my preferences here
just adding a little dip here dropping this into the shadows all right
you know just where it's catching the light
a little bit a little bit on here
we're just adding some depth there by dodging and burning with this pin
it wasn't registering and in fact just pretty much every other tablet
you know the ease of use the convenience of this
the price for the small is two hundred and forty nine dollars
it's Wacom is the correct way of pronouncing net
I'll do them Friday on Saturday as well
welcome viewers to a special product review in this video
quad-core tablet with an isp display on android 9 operating system
you'll determine if the matrix pad s8 is right for you
stay tuned our full review is up next
welcome back so this is the box that it comes in
it's well labeled with some general info about a tablet to the back
you have the matrix pad s8 tablet itself
Wi-Fi support and here chose the 5 gigahertz band is not supported
the thermal information shows temperatures holding steady around 20 degrees Celsius
and that's it for system and hardware information
Prime video to only show in basic 480p quality
I also attempted an android game and played fairly ok
give this video the thumbs up and look forward to my next video where
I featured a bigger model - this version
don't forget to subscribe to my channel and see you in the next one
it's a 10 inch tablet running android 10.
it has a 20 80 by 800 hd display
let's go ahead and see what you get inside the box
and as you can see here we have our power button the volume rockers
our little microphone usb type-c right here on the bottom here
i also love the fact that this glass has a curve to it
so setup's all complete here is the ui looks pretty clean
gigahertz and 5 gigahertz wi-fi which is always nice
you can also turn on a dark theme which is pretty nice
another thing about this is is when you turn the screen off
it almost looks like it's 1080p especially on a screen this size
now the best we can do is balanced
let's um it seems to be definitely a lot smoother than a pub g
let's go to graphics as you can see
the graphics are set to low you cannot set it any higher
that's pretty much what it's going to be
yeah i definitely don't see any lag whatsoever
scrolling through previous applications pretty smooth microphone works pretty good how are you
i've been busy staying up to date on the latest election news
let me know if there's anything i can do for you
but i'm here to tell you i did
uh but it will work with your sd card just fine
camera here is capable of doing eight megapixels
it's nothing to write home about but again
are you really buying a tablet like this for the camera quality
i really think that the video and audio quality are also good enough
you can do that on this tablet very easily
the max resolution is going to be 720
so if you're going to use this in home like i have here
i have some lights on in the background
the viewing angles on this tablet are excellent as you can see
we're looking at it dead on right now
it is surrounded by plastic but it doesn't feel cheap at all
it feels pretty sturdy in your hand and at no time
life is also really good on this tablet
you really shouldn't see any lag at all again
there is a ton of two-in-ones and chromebooks but not many tablets
optimizing the chrome os software for tablet experience
so i just wanted to check it out
and then the kickstand is made of thin plastic
and then you get the charger and then obviously the 10.1
first impressions of this tablet are extremely positive
it weighs a pound or less just under a pound
i mean it's going to be smaller than your full-size keyboard
might take some getting used to but i think the keys have great travel
it has a nice click on the front of it
the kickstand itself is made of a thin plastic
don't be expecting like a microsoft surface pro type of kickstand here
it's not going to be quite as rigid as that
however the hinge does seem very sturdy it holds its positions
it has a 10.1 inch full hd 1920 by 1200 ips touchscreen display
that's rated at 400 nits so it does get nice and bright
but there's plenty of adapters on the market
so taking a look at the screen here i think they nailed it
they did that moving on to the keyboard
it's not great but it's also not bad either
it's very nice to have the thing about it
also the kickstand isn't the easiest to pop out again
i want to make you aware of overall
i think it's a really nice package when it comes to performance
uh you know video editing software downloads and stuff like that
look at youtube netflix or anything like that
do some web surfing do some research on emailing you know all that stuff
this is perfect for downloading apps and games from the google play store
i think you're going to be very pleasantly surprised
this thing does hold up very well when it comes to
that might be able to play on a pc
life has been really good as well now
in fact i cannot believe you get you know
a 10.1 inch full hd tablet that runs efficiently and runs well
and you get a keyboard and kickstand in the box
in my opinion a terrific value a terrific device for a student or someone
that's looking for a secondary computer that has a lot of functionality
this is a perfect solution in my opinion
hello friends welcome back and today we are going to do toss three
I have this back one along with the back
which is nice to hold nice to free land yeah the no
there is a aux volume control and power buttons on top
you can see there is a charging port
let's try to load the Google main page
yeah it's loading quite easily without any hiccup okay
try to load the YouTube to load some video
yeah as you can see the buffering and everything is quite fast
there is not much delay into it so finally
okay yes so that's I think it is
this is the perfect tab to check for
thanks for watching my channel when I stay bye
the performance is not bad while web browsing is fairly smooth
more complex pages may take a few extra seconds to load
the k77 has a half gig of ram
the display does have a narrow viewing angle
this also helps make the tablet easier to hold for small hands
simple games play very well in the tablet
such as subway surfers shown here the tablet is also fine for watching
but it can be expanded with the microSD card using the slot
in the back there is also a headphone jack
thanks to the durable cover that can stand up to some abuse
the snappy processor is sure to keep kids entertained with gaming streaming Netflix
we're gonna review the trust tablet graphic tablet so
okay guys so this is harder than I passed okay
so here's the actual drawing tablet so just oh look
there are the batteries so yeah let's open this up
okay guys now we what we are at the actual reveal
we need to install the drivers so cut to the computer
so oh yeah oh no my my cursor is stuck
oh we gotta make it unstuck with a big snap
this was actually very cool and very careful
say that it's bad and you should not use the circle tool but apparently
I've been excited to make this video for a while
it has finally come in the guys over at artist
this drawing tablet asked me to to do a review on the channel
so here it is just unpackaged it so uh I am
so yeah if you're looking into getting the tablet
hopefully this video will kind of help you out in making that decision
Hollywood studio in totally not on my kitchen table
we have the tablet enclosed in a very soft sheet of whatever that is
it felt safe in the box the last thing
was it getting damaged by how it was placed so of course
looks super good and by the way that little red dot in the corner
you can basically have it at any sort of angle you want
which is super useful for mapping different functions depending on the software
I don't think this is the fault of the tablet itself
I just think it is a combination of Windows
10 being weird with tablets and also the firmware
so it's not even working correctly with the tablet
know sort of delays or weird glitches on the screen
I did following grant Abbott's beginner sculpting tutorial
I'm sculpting and I want in deeper indents
I can just push the pen down harder
it has that little pressure bubble that comes up on the screen
just feel cheap and flimsy now the buttons work
I think those are the only two complaints I have about this thing
I think that's a good price range for it
so if you're interested there will be links in the description to it
this is the VTech light-up baby touch tablet and it's super super cute
you will be saved yes you will save
this video is brought to you by gaomon again
i've reviewed two of your tablets before pd1161 the s620
i'm going to be reviewing i'll show you the screen
i guess this also came with a felt case
it's pretty bright so i'm just going to give it a focus here
so it's something new for me to try out
i'll get into my thoughts about this tablet later
just enjoy the speed paint for now so now bye me
oh all right so my thoughts about this pen display
the response time of the pen is really good as well
there is a little bit of parallax between the pen
this is also a fit for intermediate artists and hobbyists
knowing that there are a lot of screen tablets that are really really pricey
here is the finished drawing of our flower video
i really did have fun drawing her oc
bring it in today for more updates and my videos
i will see you guys in the next video peace
i'm probably gonna fail a lot here and it just
we go put this away get it out of there all right
i didn't mean to do that but okay you
hello and welcome back to another video review
I even pick up at your various locations
highly protective stand handle case built out of a really rigid foam
so it's very very protective wraps completely around the the Amazon fire tablet so
let's go ahead and stick this in here and I could show you
Oh kinda is a tight fit you just kind of work it around
the speaker and of course the front camera is not covered at all
take the tablet out to get to that easy access to it
obviously easy power out and power off volume
the nice thing about this is that you know
and that's the big point about it and very portable
I guess easy to take around with you now
the the fire tablet doesn't have the best camera in the world but like
I said there are the cutouts for you
that's very very protective and easy to grab and go right
basically on all the social media so let it checks out otherwise
model number is ma and it's a 8.4
inch tablet so let me go through some good features
the first thing that stands out on this tablet is the build quality
I just feel like you got that quality
it has a front camera on the right side
okay so that's why it comes with no case
it doesn't go to you like how you have to login with your username
you have to set them up on your own by going to the settings
its own and you know say up so
I don't it does have Android 7.1 billion
it has a billion eighty a 63 64 bit processor
one good thing about this screen is that it plays back 4k video okay
so that's another good thing and that screen looks amazing
that's probably the best thing about this tablet and it's a 8.4
it doesn't have no screen protector or like a case so okay
ram and 32 gig internal memory but you can also put a micro
ok so you know you don't have to worry worry about taking forever
we're gonna give your downloaded some game that does take up couple of gigs
you can see that haven't downloaded anything when I was trying to go back
you see they had to press a couple of times to actually go back
but it's you know the quality isn't the best okay
okay now in my opinion you know this tablet
is that you know it is quite slow the camera
hello my name is Peter parfaits and in the next few minutes
I will be talking to you about this
you're using a stylus or pen like this with no wires
now many of you are more used to seeing
I write for the UK magazine the woodworker
what is a national magazine like this one of mine
then you've got to put a significant amount of effort into that now when
there were a couple of things in the background that
I really didn't want to be there but they weren't under my control
there was a person walking by and so on and so
the whole process would have been much easier now
there's a small and a large as well
I'm now going to connect the USB cable I know
the tablet can detect pressure from the pen at 2048 different levels
I press very gently and now we'll next up
it's going to be thicker if you don't like what you see there
I've programmed one of these keys to be a delete key and so there
and you can set that however you like lots of different options
I'm just going to show you one simple example of this
I've got Adobe Premiere Elements running in the background
it's moving it there right unclick at a time
I don't have to keep altering the size of the tool
let's see if we can get rid of that
run of glue doesn't look very clever and there we go
we try and find myself having to do quite often
Photoshop is doing a lot of this for me
it detects the edges quite nicely however it still does help when you're using
it's coming into effect here and that's wrong nice
and let's fill this the nice soft the way we go so they were
you can use the active area of the panel
just like the the trackpad on a notebook computer
Photoshop it might be Premiere Elements it might be AutoCAD
I've really enjoyed having a play with this in choice
it's a smaller thing altogether and only has 6
Express keys instead of the 8 that we've on this machine
I've enjoyed doing this and with any luck for my birthday
I'm going to get the small touch version of the insurace 5 thank you
Hey guys, I'm the Deal Guy, Matt Granite.
First of all, if you like this content, give this video a thumbs up.
It lets me know what type of content to make
I am going to do a full unboxing of the Fire tablet
and you're going to be amazed where this actually outperformed the almost $1,000 iPad
So let's go to the unboxing and the test.
I always wear shorts when I'm wearing a shirt and tie.
Let's turn this on and set this up.
With that being said, let's do a page load test.
I did a video on how to instantly make your Wi-Fi speed faster.
All right, so the iPad should have an advantage.
Okay, the iPad had an advantage on a cached page.
The iPad Pro is generally supposed to be a second faster on video.
For whatever reason, the Fire tablet was faster.
We're comparing a nearly $1,000 tablet to a nearly $100 tablet.
You'll notice though that there's not a huge difference between the two, right?
And I apologize, it's a little bit windy
So we're gonna start with a photo on the iPad Pro.
All right, here's the photo from the iPad. (camera clicks)
And I'm obviously gonna show this to you guys side by side.
And let's do a photo on the Fire tablet.
I'll tell you that even switching between photo and video is not that simple.
You have a, there's like a pullout menu that...
Let's go to video and we're gonna shoot video now.
I'll do a panning shot, so I'm gonna.
So this is the Fire tablet panning video.
My daughter calls these toy cars whenever she looks down.
She doesn't realize that they're just cars from a distance.
And now for the Fire tablet, obviously you're gonna get 4K video.
Just looking through the city at this display is night and day.
But again, you're spending over $900 for this.
I would expect the camera to be amazing, and it is.
I'm not going to drop a $900 iPad Pro onto the ground.
That screen's gonna crack and I'm not gonna pay for it.
Let's go again, I'm trying to get it face down.
I'm going to show you that, no matter what I do
And you'll look, the back is almost completely unscathed.
So what have we learned from this video?
at the time, it held up better than the new Fire tablet.
You're not out all the cash you would spend.
Even to get the screen repair on an iPad
Pro is more expensive that what you would experience replacing this whole tablet.
Now that I'm back inside, I'll show you that the smashed
I can see all of the photos that I took outside, my video.
Beautiful. Now what is the big takeaway message?
The Fire HD 8 is a fully capable tablet for consuming content.
That means Prime Video, Netflix, all of your favorite apps.
the functionality tied into this tablet is unbelievable.
You could even use this as a secondary universal remote control for your television.
So well done for the designers of the Fire tablet, and the iPad
Pro obviously doesn't need me to give it a two thumbs up.
You'll know why that is good, although I don't like the price.
So I hope you did find this interesting.
So I'm honored to have been a part of your day. Bye-bye.
I've got my hands on a new two-in-one tablet by Chewie
I'm gonna unbox the keyboard so here we have a case
QWERTY keyboard and in magnetic dock connection for the tablet
so here is the keyboard you also have touchpad included with two buttons
they're not like the cheap keyboards you get
let's get the tablet out of the box
USBC fast charging the back of this tablet is made completely from metal
you've got a pretty decent build quality very nice screen
colors look sharp and vivid and the full
it's nice and bright and an absolute pleasure to look at so
we have a power button and volume rocker
so on this side we have a 3.5 millimeter
so you can stream a maximum of 1080p on YouTube through the Android system
now we're gonna check out the gaming performance
so g4s controller which are connected via bluetooth and is connected successfully
10 if we go to system properties so we are running
so let's see how it plays so there you have it guys
I like the option of having both Windows and Android on a dual boot
and it's great how you can change between them quite easily
the performance was great on both Android and Windows
so you guys can check this product out
see you in the next one bye you
yep so once i scan you can see that
you can have the control access automated with also temperature scanning results
Alex and welcome to a new review for today we have
Amazon's latest tablet a $79 Fire HD eight carat
we also have 1.5 gigs of ram 16
however this is quite normal for a tablet it costs only $79
don't expect any great pictures from that camera
either on the top we have the power button
we also have the micro USB charging port
we have a slot for an SD card
SD card in speaking about the internal storage out of the 16
I think the scores are more than appropriate
the maximum resolution is 720p at 60 frames per second
that's basically the maximum resolution of the tablet
I mentioned the YouTube app which is not available from the Amazon storage
it's running a modified version of Android called the fire OS and this particular
Amazon tablets are mostly aimed at Amazon users
because they're so cheap and basically do anything else with it
we also don't have a GPS unit inside this tablet
of course this could be improved but with that the price would increase
pretty sure they're going to be able to get this for around $50 around
hopefully enjoy this video if you did like it press that like button
don't forget subscribe and I'll see in the next time
and this is the asus memo pad 7 inch tablet
but we've got a sort of soft plastic touch here on the nexus
it's a little bit harder on the memo pad it's also a bumpier texture
one advantage is that there's actually a micro
there might be a little bit more lag than you would
experience on a faster tablet but web surfing look works fine
I don't have any real complaints for $150 device
they look fine as you sort of start to come down here
the colors get washed out in difficult to see
it's also a lower resolution screen which means that when you're on the home
it's really not a bad tablet so for $149
it's not just the processor but also the the display and
if you sort of pay attention to which angles work well
I think for a hundred and fifty dollar tablet this is Brad
you can find more details at lil defeating calm
headphone jack we've a volume up and down button
I'm navigating through if they want to go out of the kids own
but you can also extend that with a micro
SD memory card so the battery life is okay
it helps out the kids a lot as well
setup was very easy since it is a screenless
which you can see on the screen right now
i have decided to recreate the mona lisa in my own
first off one thing i noticed on the tablet is how super sensitive
i don't think it'll be as difficult to get used to this but myself
i just moved closer to the computer screen
but that's not necessarily the best way especially for digital art
that's something that i'm not used to so i was very happy with that
i think that makes my workflow a lot faster
that is pretty much my favorite blend mode when it comes to watercolor effects
and then i brush lightly on the highlighted section
there's a smudge tool that also comes in the brush
pack and if it's a watercolor brush pack then
i make sure to select from the watercolor pack and for example
four is very simple and the last one
it might not be for some people but that's just my experience
i do wish that there was an adjustment for it as well
that's not necessarily my workflow and just to compare that a little bit
it's not perfect but it gets the job done
and the many things i tried to squeeze into this video
hopefully it wasn't too confusing or all over the place
if you are interested in purchasing the gaomon m10k graphic tablet
i will leave their links in the description box
hello there YouTube land this is Tom IAM
and this is review the x58 tablet computer
that's been sitting around the office for absolutely forever
and we've only just got a charger for it
let's take a look at the hardware first full-size USB port
nothing on that side and nothing on that side of this thing there
which wouldn't surprise me right on the front we have buttons
that aren't these are actually is resistive touch green and these require pressure
it means you'd have to fiddle with the harder buns right
so this is a 7-inch screen with an absolutely useless resolution
facebook it has their android market which book we get into
and i don't know if the app store you know
an app store is where you can download stuff from it
i download a dolphin browser which i'll show you yeah hope
they're quite remember that does think it's for shortcuts
I don't actually have the full specs for this
I've actually downloaded the market and put stuff on it so it might
so hey ho angry birds as you would probably expect for a tablet
some reason my hand is bright white as well
there's some really weird lighting stuff going on here and I wholeheartedly apologize
there's the catapult thing there it's launched a bird
the materials clearly very high quality absolutely no flex in it whatsoever
you can't press on the screen and make it dip
sadly did come with a manual manual is written in fairly good
English but it does have some gems such as a one there
this device do not support watch proof function bad times
there you go if you want to buy this
I've got a package here it says I belong it
this is kind of a product review of sorts
they actually advertised the damn thing as a
I can already tell you as I always
yes this pen is like the best tablet pen
I have ever held in my in my hands
it's like if if some reason you destroy this personal camera there
so it's all the same as its s in the tablet itself
yep this is like half the size of what
you're not going to play with this whole thing
I have had sorry and I've had like four different
it's very light but as long as you have a big mouse mat
then it's not going to slip anywhere if like for rubber
I don't know how much the the one with the buttons I
I got this one sent to me personally from the company from China
definitely in just that it says also on it
it's going to be geared to wash it towards it
Krista oh it's on the side you plug it in from the side
there and the damn thing is out there so oh well
I actually forgot to mention something about the pin
yeah you after playing with this for about a week
I guess but I will say that it is absolutely perfect for a beginner
then by all means go buy this tablet
Huyen I can't even pronounce your name but good on you you you you
this is a very different product from any other
our battery which meters claims can give you four hours of continuous usage
hey guys today i just got me a new tablet
what i have here is a juno canvas
20 drawing display tablet pen which is 19 inches
the tablet did come with a pin holder
well basically picture because once you get it
when you're mostly known for just drawing on the non-monitored tablet
and it's a really nice thing for people to switch over
I'm going to leave you is Pablo a 640
I was hoping this tablet doesn't do that anyway
let's move on to what this tablet contains first
because never seen a table pen like this
I don't know why they made like this
the name of the table is long and thick
while you're aiming really hard otherwise it's okay now
I didn't have any technology for easier to the public so personally
there will be no problem with a just in the area
hi guys this is raju rahman from techtonic dragon
one of their aims is to produce affordable electronics
and the fact that this tablet sells for around 100 quid
i tested it out for a few weeks
and if you're interested in finding out what that was like keep watching here
it's well designed nothing over the top nice and simple
it's a little worrying when you have to point out
there's plastic on top of the screen with some instructions
have a read of that if you want
i know how to turn the tablet on so off
you go looks like there's some bubbles here on the screen protector
let's see what else is in the box
you've got a three pin uk power plug a usb a2 micro
you've got a two megapixel front facing camera around the back
you have the cover for the micro sd card slot
the cover does feel a little flimsy taking it off also reveals
and what seems like dual speakers around the bottom
the back of the tablet is actually made of metal
i thought the whole thing would be plastic
installed screen protector as you can see the screen
but leave it on unless you want to scratch up that screen
when you're holding this tablet you can tell
there's no getting away from that but don't get me wrong
b g n and ac no wi-fi 6 here
also one thing that dragon touch likes to point out
it's good enough for consuming content on netflix and youtube
it may not be super crisp or sharp
but it's hard to complain for too long
that's a little odd is the display refresh rate
and the chrome browser side by side here
graphically intensive games are the way to go with this tablet
i was quite surprised that i was able to play hungry
so gaming is something you'll definitely be able to do with the k10
don't have great cameras but if you have to know the cameras on
pictures taken outside during the day are kind of okay
they're not too bad compared to the pictures
the video also isn't that great it lacks in vibrance and clarity
certain things are overexposed but to be honest
i'm being a bit too hard with the k10
no one really cares about the cameras on a tablet
it's pretty bad the max volume isn't loud at all
have the quality of the sound being better
fortunately the tablet does come with a 3.5 millimeter standard headphone jack and bluetooth
the k10 had six percent of battery life left
although not all games it can run most casual games fairly well
you know during my initial use of the k10
i thought i wouldn't be able to recommend this to anyone
it just works well enough and those are the key words
then yes i do highly recommend this tablet
and don't forget to check out these other videos too
I could not find any actual video reviews on this product not too shabby
there's not too much to get excited about in the box
probably soap that you and your boyfriend can share gay photos together
apparently max view cannot translate Chinese to English a quick glance at the box
1.2 gigahertz you've got to be bullshitting me
you cheap live look dumb 1.5 goddamn gigahertz
they did a phenomenally shitty job of answering emails
welcome to my channel and as you can guess from the intro
i'm going to be talking about graphics tablets
do you really need them as a photographer
and what are the benefits of having a graphics tablet okay
it's up there with apple versus mac and canon versus nikon or sony
what works for you may not work for someone else
so i've been using a trackball mouse since 2004.
i use trackball modes even into graphic design
i was the only one in my team
he ended up switching back to his standard mouse because his hand was sore
i've had issues in the past with drumming with bad technique
it'll actually be quite sore and painful like to stretch it out
that's that's my main hand for drummond and everton
let's get into what we're actually here to talk about
uh even down to the fact that it's battery free
you have to worry about any of that
it works every time it has a customizable buttons on it
both of these are offering over 8 000 levels of pen pressure
i'd ever set up on it and i stopped using them
i buy a graphics tablet literally for the accuracy
when you're using it and that's what's so important about it
it's just such an easy way to work
it's accurate and that's why i bought a graphics habit
i use the pen when i want to use the trackball mouse
oh no i've got the i've got the pen
i'm only going to use the pen like i know
you can do this kind of editing in lightroom
um i don't really over like doing it
i will do all my dodging and burning in photoshop
you shouldn't be settling for just a mouse
you should be looking to make sure that your work is perfect
i think it's up there on par with wacom
it's a third-party affordable option that you don't have to put the expense into
i just want to say xp pen did not give me this graphics tablet
i've owned this literally is my own personal one
i'm extremely impressed and happy with the company
i would highly recommend the xp pen deco pro small
ring that bell to get notified for the next time i post a video
i post a video every thursday and follow me on my social medias
you'll find me everywhere on mark duffy photography whether that's facebook instagram
sometimes a little bit of twitter and until the next time later gators you
their daddy just did a slight burn before game
oh you think it was two perps well there
you go the to burp edition of live from their nursery rhyme
wow you don't never use a guest so dark in the mornings
who puts the lights on in your room
Daddy yesterday that Daddy could have some of your toast if he wanted
no that's just daddy other check him out the chips you know healthy
can you press sky tells you all the popular character sir
his outfit when the jungle makes it look like a kind of 40-something executives
he's having a midlife crisis and decided to start jogging
they've got like a whole bunch of these various models different sizes
this one is the mid-7th got a couple of different features
as far as the other two 7-inch tablets
and this one also has a camera up here in the corner
so that's how a couple of differentiating factors from the other 7-inch
we just got a little speaker up here in the corner
so we've got this little button right here this
but it's actually a back button and like
I said that got a little camera up here
it's supposed to be for video chatting whatnot the camera
almost you can adjust it but the camera
right here as you can see that gives us lots of options for customization
I found that it's actually surprisingly adequate as you can see stuff
they smooth even with a live wallpaper on here
so as far as the processor goes as far as single
obviously dual core is gonna get you some more speed but from what
actually we've got some different games on here and they work well in
of course the touchscreen it works pretty well the capacitive touchscreen on the Coby
actually okay as you see out here there's no Google market new Play Store
I went ahead and download a couple other app stores
you can also get like your daily free paid app
it works for the most part some of the other apps
I got it like I got YouTube through there
let me go ahead and show you some of the video playback like
I said Netflix does work so Netflix runs
it doesn't get rid of that like what it does with the other tablets
it's not going to show up on here at all
it's got the 800 by 480 resolution screen
I really don't care for it that much
you've got the different widgets but you can have weather widgets on here
you can move them around and that's a little gallery widget for the pictures
there's some of the stock photos that it comes with the biggest deal
the biggest problem with this tablet is the battery life
it's the main thing that holds it back from being a decent buy
you're lucky if you get five hours of battery life out of this thing
I've got this full written review right here with the budget information
hey everyone i hope you're all well today i'm going to be doing
we're kind enough to send me another tablet this time
i think is to celebrate their 15th anniversary
i don't really know what a good comparison is so the usb usb interface
i'll take the actual tablet out of the wrapper in a second
i should have maybe open the packaging before i start filming okay
spare nibs and there's quite a few of them so that's always good
i did commented saying it's to help remove nibs
so that's i guess that's all that is awesome
i don't see like the quick start guide
i used to use like a while ago
i think that's a workable size and for me
so yeah you can see all the the shortcut buttons they're round
and you'll have a zip file which you need to extract
that's how easy it is and it'll do it
and then you'll have the little icon for the tablet pen
it literally takes a few minutes to do
you might want to play around with that but it's no big deal
it's you know it's not a problem so please
oh my god it fits perfectly i was yeah
the tablet itself is seven by four inches as the tablet as a whole
obviously the actual drawing area is a bit smaller than that
um but in my opinion this is like the perfect size tablet
i think it'd be quite good for that as well
um the pen is very responsive pressure wise
i had to adjust it slightly to suit me but it was otherwise fine
which if you're a beginner artist that would be great
it saves you shedding out a load of money for something
you don't know how you're going to get along with
i didn't find it lacking particularly in anything that i needed
low-cost tablet that didn't take up too much space
just in case something happened to my ipad
i believe the deco mini 7 is 49.99 from xp pen uk
i hope this video is useful for anyone
trying to find a new tablet or wondering about this particular type of tablet
i hope you're staying safe and are well and everything else
this tablet was ready to go plug it in
delete the old tablet drivers then restart the PC
Pro I had to push a little more to get the same line
wait and while at first this is annoyance
that's just how much more potential for line control
this little battery list pen had previously with my way on tablet
the drivers would have issues with paint tool
telling you how to get the drivers from the website
action set up while the touchscreen idea is cool on paper
I find myself rubbing my arm against the buttons
the only difference between the two would be that the
making good for use on your regular-sized desks
the tablet works with all the artwork programs
I tested it on including paint tool Sai Photoshop clip studio paint and carita
I do have the give him some good pointers
it'd be much better if they were just solid buttons that
this helps a lot with wire management and
some people have apprehensions about battery less pens which being
I've only ever had these two specific models of tablet
hey what's going on guys the CTA praten back here again today
we're gonna be taking a look at Walmart's all new on surf tablet pro
you're gonna receive a few coupons like $10 off your grocery purchase
Vudu free but I'm interested in the tablet itself
USB type-c cable and a 1 amp 5 volt charger now
it looks like they have their proprietary keyboard dock connector
I'm not sure if they're selling this yet
now that's pretty much it for buttons on the unit but up top
we do have dual stereo speakers and I have tested these out
they actually sound pretty good for a cheap tablet aspect schoo
it's looking a lot better than the 2019
we have the mediatek and four cores at two gigahertz for the GPU
so it is built into this version of Android 10
that definitely doesn't seem like much but with these cheaper tablets
are the cameras on these tablets because most of them are garbage
I had to run some benchmarks on both of them on the left-hand side
we have the new on tablet on the right hand side
5 Orion 2 to to run on the Amazon Fire HD
so we do have a significantly more powerful
you're not gonna get any 4k content on this
you can download this directly from the Google Play Store
I also tested Amazon Prime video and Hulu but here we have some Netflix
Plus it'll work out just fine so with video playback out of the way
so first up we have Minecraft Pocket Edition
but this one here seems pretty smooth here
King of Fighters all-star and performance here isn't great
we're at the lowest settings with the lowest frame rate
it's gonna work fine all of those run at full speed
let's move up to a harder one like
Dead or Alive - and see how it performs
this is a really easy one to run
I was hoping for some better emulation performance
I used to draw something on drawing paper whenever I had time
let's try this one thin and lighted this graphics
there are top of the class tabs available for around 40 to 50 cakes
but this one right here is more than enough to start with
I'll see you guys next time till then good bye
so that's what we're going to do today
it has eight express keys as well as two in one dial express ring
the tablet is less than a centimeter tall height
bring it along with your laptop and draw from anywhere
and you can power the tablet directly through your computer's usb port
is the familiar cylinder which contains the stylus
but we'll get back to that in a moment in this white box here
you will find some anniversary items from xp pen along with a drawing glove
that actually feels really nice to ride with
are all of the power supplies this one here is the actual power supply
you'll find eight additional pin laps unscrew the other cap
its design has been slightly updated and it has a really nice rubber surface
it has only one level as i mentioned earlier
the innovator 16 display itself is wrapped in two layers of protective foil
i'm disengaging my party mode because it's time to set up this baby
the cables are designed as a 3 in 1 solution
that's the only cable going into the tablet
you can choose either windows ios or a beta for linux
i recommend you restart your computer before doing anything else
i like to have a shortcut for flipping my canvas
i was most concerned with because all of my other xp pen tablets
let's check out how much parallaxing we can detect for
my general impression of the screens quality was really good
i know a lot of other tablets out there
and that means that this tablet right now has a discount on it
i think i have concluded what i wanted to conclude
this is my new main tablet for the time being
i'll do what i can to get back to as many people as possible
dad doesn't today we are looking at the nah
BSE this is a 7-inch tablet for kids ages 6 and up
$79 they pack a whole lot into this
it's a 7 inch tablet it's running Android 6.0
we're going to jump in look at some of that
because we think that's very important in the kids tablet for this reason
they'll do that so you know key thing
but like we said the big thing is the blue morpho
just take you through this to give you a little example here okay so
you've earned stars and this keeps growing so
it really all is educational and then they throw the game element onto it
also we want to show you some other things
this dream pro studio so they can draw anime
um and that's it when you get this you get over 400 different games
apps educational experiences loaded onto it so again
it's one of those things for 79 bucks you know maybe during the holidays
they pulled out of the box and they can start doing stuff
I'm we're gonna show you in a bit you can
you've got the camera the gallery you know
English math social studies have all of that there
what they're doing is actually can then earn
Noby points and you can do different things
they get enough points and this is actually being sold through
I think that gamification is really going to work with kids
I just want to show you that and just want to show here
this is the treasure box and basically this is kids curated apps
have all been curated specifically for kids and you can
if there's something which is maybe a little bit less educational more fun
they want here again with those knobby coins
if they do their chores the amount of time they spend
that's good - let's say kind of in a pinch
you need a tablet to do some stuff and your kids have the knobby
um overall do also want to say this
well the things which we really like about
they've got all these different apps educational experiences and that a safe environment
you know it's only available between the hours of 4:00 and 8:00 p.m.
so rather than kids constantly asking you can
I use the tablet can I use it
you can also have things kind of based on what they do
so the reporting aspect is pretty neat and something you want to get an
the other big part of it is just kind of the safe environment
it's nice to be able to hand them
this tablet one because of the rubberized a bumper around it
do you know this animator drawing all of that
well and parents going to feel a little bit better about their screen
all right this video won't be like the others
well that's because i have um well wait
this is the box that it comes and i think it's pretty looking
i don't know what else to say about box but i like that
so let's open this and see what it has on the inside
i tried to take it off to keep it
it looks way more professional than the other one i had
i'm not sure about um the little bump thing
but maybe that's because i'm just used to wacom um the cable
uh you're gonna use that with your phone
okay inside there is a thank you for supporting us card
there's great guide on how to start up a warranty policy
i did not need to restart the computer just to make it work
it felt weird to use so much fresher on the pad tablet
i have been drawing for years on a screen tablet
um it works on abyss paint sketchbook and medibang
i tried doing a little bit of speed paint
okay so i used this tablet for a couple of weeks and it did
not glitch did not do anything stupid like the driver crashing or anything
okay while this speed paint is going on
and then i found out two other teachers are using it
i think that you can use this as a teacher and a student
you can use this as an artist or a photographer
i even tried to use it on osu
it felt good even though they told me not to use it
uh clip studio paint paint tool sai version one and two
adobe animate i tried it on rafael paga and medibang
it is a little bit weird to get used to it
i'm just gonna keep it simple so one
it is a great tablet for a beginner artist
yeah and i think that is about it
that's my whole review on this deco mini 7 tablet
so check out the description and leave a like or comment
hey guys how's it going daniel here today
we're taking a look at the new amazon fire tablet now
this tablet retails for 50 and as far as specs go
if you have seen a lot of retina displays in ultra hd displays
this tablet has every single thing on the top of the tablet
we have the micro usb we have the mic
we have the volume jack and then we have the volume rocker
we of course get the amazon app store which has a lot of apps
now now this does come pre-installed with a ton of apps
in this so you can add like little stickers to pictures and things
the great thing about this tablet is that anything you open up
it opens up as it should and at no point
are you reminded that you only paid 50 for this tablet
this actually manages to make those 50 dollars worth it now
or you know actually want to use this tablet so first off
fire with that said this is also great for kids
it won't be very efficient or quick or easy to do
they kind of look cool from time to time
it was just kind of to show you
and i'll catch you guys in the next one goodbye
what's going on guys the CTA Prime back here again today
we're gonna be taking a look at the all-new 2019
this is known as sage but they offer three other colors
we have our basic black plum sage which
did bump the specs up a little bit
this is the same CPU that's in the Amazon fire
eight and so mediatek mt6752 one gigabyte of ddr4
8 version this is a 1024 by 600
IPS display and the viewing angles are amazing
I don't think it's taking full advantage of it
the download speeds are really good for a cheap tablet like this bluetooth
OS C point three zero which is based on Android 7.1.2
I personally haven't had enough time to test this out
let's go ahead and see how this thing performs
this is coming in on the very low end of the scale
I was only able to run ice storm
now it's time to move over to some native
Android gaming unfortunately pub G would not run on here
I've been able to run this on a ton of different devices
but it wouldn't even start up so the first game
crap is definitely playable on the new 2019
Prime video just wanted to show you a work in here
Kodi on here use a custom build or play files from the SD card
that are gonna run fine like Mario Kart rampage or super
Tekken 3 again really great performance pretty much
all of the lower end consoles are going to run fine on here from
Atari 2600 up to ps1 including some n64 games
here's SNES and I'm still using retroarch with snes9x runs at full speed
Kodi if you want to so that's pretty much it for this video guys
I will leave a link in the description
maybe subscribe to the channel but like always
we are trying to buy this new tablet from wailmer
ok battery life only 4 hours that means after 4 hours
tablet has a camera but it doesn't have flash on the camera
it's important to mention that and also have a external memory card slot
here the headset adapter of course volume and the charging port
see okay but this one has a common one
hundreds tablet or smartphone has and the display is this resolution
let's go to menu settings in you go so seeing mode
so here you can set everything to aromatic and so since
I don't have any any flash so you can actually set as a nine
you can set two seconds ten seconds and picture size
these are the picture sizes that you can take on this tablet
I took some pictures on this tablet outside and okay and these are the
I mean a pass and continue so you can pass a video continue recording
camera is the same with rear-facing camera 0.3
so we can expect the same as well
probably you're wondering about this tablet and but i'ms I mean it's a good
you can receive notification of our other tutorials related to this tablet
hello everyone i'm going to review the xp pen deco 01 v2
i want to give a big thank you to xpen for giving me this
we have this pen which is good for your grip
and it's not that firm nor is it too bouncy
this is the tablet screen protector and this is a cute little
thank you card along with the instruction manuals
i also forgot to mention these buttons in the previous footage
the pen pressure works really nicely and there were no issues with the driver
thanks so much for watching and i'll see you in the next video bye
this guy has a so-so display and a plastic non removable back
who sees no screws here and for no access to the battery
here is actually speaker on each side for stereo
that's can do things like HDMI out with an optional accessory
you have a front-facing video camera here for her video
Froyo but you do get the big widgets here
the launcher is it's fairly handy over here
and you've got the weather embedded over here
you can either plug in a location you use your
and you can set up social networking over here this will do either
as mentioned the second instance of the social networking widget up
and when you're on this screen you can also switch
Froyo and tap over here you see all of your applications
they are arranged in pages like so in alphabetical order and yes
for example the buns of course are obviously designed for landscape orientation
they are facing down and missing just like with the speak
Android search button so we have three on four standard Android buttons
that's the same resolution as a high-end smartphone
it's a rebranding a mobi teething and we'll take a look at that
that's included there which seems to be pretty much included on every
I get to hear the speakers do performance again
the game is pretty good also web browsing with
the web browser here again is 800 by 480 resolution
so it's the same thing you'll see on your smart phone
it doesn't bog down the device to a flash 10.1
can on some slower CPU to Android devices
visit our website to read the full review
now I'm going to review about the best tablet under $300 on the market
we may not get a chance to change the price mentioned in the video
it has a battery which lasts for 10 hours of operation
Lenovo tab 4 za 2j zero zero zero seven us
this tablet offers the opportunity to create multiple profiles
the tablet measures 10 inches and features built-in dual stereo front-facing speakers with Dolby
connectivity which allows the connection of a lenovo bluetooth keyboard for productivity mode
another key feature of this tablet is the 20 hour battery life
it can run for 11 hours before a recharge making it
a great option for getting through the activities of the day
if you are looking for a kid-friendly option then this is the right choice
it offers access to the Samsung kids option
also get this stylus pen here as well
this tablet has a front camera and a rear camera as well
but that's just an additional features that he has packed into it
it also comes with a 2 gig ram and 32 gig internal memory
it's also durable protective case and protects the edges
it also provides a lot of grip as well so while you're holding it
the main screen is the scratches you will get on the screen protector
now when you go settings this is how it looks
okay so you got network blue connect connect bluetooth
it's literally like here at any kind of android and smart devices
who's the main account holder administrator except for location security accounts here
so that's where you can add the extra accounts also
it has excel accessibility digital well-being and parental controls
and it's a budget price tablet that i do highly recommend
this is a full-on 10-inch tablet that runs android
has a little bit of weight to it
i'm not going to lie but you know what it gives it
more of a premium feel because it does have pretty solid specs
the standby time is up to 15 days
but not least it does have a camera
you have a five megapixel front-facing camera you know
but zoom calls and all that absolutely massive
this is going to be me logging off
hello and thanks for joining another review today we have the Polaroid p10 10.1
Big Lots I'll give you a basic rundown of the specifications
it's a thousand twenty four by six hundred capacitive
multi-touch display a quad-core processor it runs Android 4.4.2 kitkat
HD video output by way of the mini HDMI port adapter not included
lithium-ion polymer battery of around 8 hours battery life
this has an edge lit screen unfortunately with edgelet screens
you can go into the settings and they have a for the display
make sure the smart color is on in this mode
it does greatly improve the screen on this thing
maybe well they all have a little bit of a quirk to them okay
the speakers on the back so it sounds tinny
this tablet has bluetooth and it's Bluetooth 4.0
I mentioned it earlier but I don't think I stressed enough
it's not as comfortable to hold as a an iPad or anything like that
it's it's much heavier and it does have a good
you know rubber rubberized filling on the back
but it's still you know it's still very heavy
that's my review of the polaroid p10 10.1 internet tablet
we're gonna be taking a look at the all-new
this is a new tablet to hit the market
it's got a 10.1 inch screen and octa-core CPU and it runs Android 9.0
its paces to see if it's worth picking up now the first thing
the tablet does have dual stereo speakers over on the left hand side
now it will depend on what you're doing
there was only a sound recorder and an FM radio pre-installed
so if we just start up the app
I'm going to load up a game have the FPS counter
it's locked at a maximum of 50 and that's really unfortunate even viewing videos
they sound pretty good and it gets pretty loud next up
I'm here and I know people are gonna ask about it
if you're just looking to play call of duty mobile
but that's pretty much it for this video guys
it's a definite pass on this tablet for me at least at this time
I'd but now we're taking a look today at the Chewie high nine
that can fix your mobile device anywhere you are
you can go on their website to book an appointment
they will come out and meet you when they say they will come
in many instances they can come out the same day
we had a really fun time with pulse here in the studio
sometimes one device to the next might be a little different in this case
and that's one of those things you run into with these devices
you're kind of buying at your own risk
this morning we had wiped down the screen and got it all cleaned up
and it's already picking up dirt and grease again
Lenovo so buy at your own risk here
this one is very cold and that it's very blue
and you'll notice that when you're reading text and other things on there
so it's relatively up to date on that front
three hundred and forty eight point six grams or twelve point three ounces
you can see what it looks like from the side
we did see a little better performance out of that
I'm gonna switch out of this now and go over to goat simulator
which is another 3d game here on the platform and you can see here
it's running pretty nicely on this one as well so
we've looked at recently in this classification these 8-inch tablets so that
there is a camera system on here not a great one
there's a 5 megapixel camera here on the back
it also does video 1080p at 30 frames per second no stabilization
the front is a little 2 megapixel selfie cam here again
I think you can do better for the money
I usually see better stuff out of Chewie than what we're seeing today
they also while they sell this in multiple color
the second is actually a very nice case
that doesn't come with a case so first impressions
I think it feels pretty good in the hand
you can't charge it through their on/off button headphone jack
overall it's got a good feel to it
then these have you can get to the volume buttons here
it's not all that well if you go right to left
if you're not using it which reminds me the battery life on
this is really not very good to be honest
there don't appear to be really any games at all now
apparently that if you install flash they'll have but everything else
so you're probably gonna want to download one of your own
but that's pretty much the gist of what this does
Berthier and yes I I was not born in 2000
that's kind of the biggest fault looking at it right here
it looks pretty good so there are views
crack the screen also not too bad so to finish up
I'd point out before I think the case is really nice
I think it's a good one for kids
it's a lot thicker so it's gonna be easier for small hands day
I want to conclude is that you're paying $60 for a tablet
but it's going to cost you a lot less
because it's not a name-brand that's not going to be the case
you probably gonna want to load your own and yeah
I have thank you very much for watching
if not you can always get an adapter
it also needs to be hooked up to the power supply
which makes it really convenient to carry if you travel a lot
you know it certainly feels like it's gonna last
I was also really impressed with the stand
you have to install the drivers so simply hop on to who
the tablet seemed to be perfectly calibrated when I first started using it
click and the other one as the ctrl
it's just generally more pleasant to work with
let's take a look at these pen nibs
today we're going to look at the latest
we're going to look at it now so here
of course that is the same resolution as the Nexus 7 so
don't you this is the 7 inch model
the operating system now gets a name there she call it fire
they've done a lot of changes to both
you're showing me stuff on the cloud as ever
they're up here pretty easy to see through the glossiness on the top
it's not going to be flat against the table
is loud enough clear enough info enough and I can hear it
we take a look at the back some more here
soft touch finish not immune to fingerprints does get greasy
you can clean it up at the damp cloth just fine so we have
Amazon's usual a unique unique sense of style
this is our power button right here on the opposite side
so when you're holding it there's a little
get the award for being some of the most tactile buttons ever
it's a little weird because this has an up
we have our three point five millimeter combo audio jack
you can see if I move it around
it's a lot easier in the eyes and there's no glare this
do we have quick control of our music playback over here and here's Mayday
they can't see you don't worry and they can hear you
Amazon account you can actually enter your Google account and here
sound keyboards you can choose from different languages here
we have our language selection you can also choose keyboards and Bluetooth keyboard languages
you can go ahead and do them for those of you
feel a bit more like a book kind of aspect ratio
Amazon claims 11 hours of mixed use time and 17 hours
if you're just reading and pretty much that has been on target
we've been managing about 10 and a half hours of mixed use including watching
Amazon goes with something like I you know
means you can play some nice games on this
we hope that we see some more killer 3d games on here
there is no expansion slot on this device
so for those of you who have a big investment in Google
I mean the free ones because they'll probably available to here like we have
just turn that on so you can sign load programs
I use andro file explorer use a USB cable
now there's a magazine that I've downloaded so you can see
it does actually work so fun to have alternatives
downloading magazines are actually a lot bigger than ebooks
meanwhile we'll take a look at books and Stephen King's latest book
I've been reading that book on the paperwhite and it knows that
obviously there's an accelerometer so it's going to rotate with you
Snapdragon 800 CPUs and any of the fastest CPUs available for mobile devices today
we have the silk browser as amazon calls it which is just a fine
so there you go embedded video plays fine and just for fun again
you'll get the same experience that you do on
take a little nitro drive a little dirty
it's playing absolutely beautifully visual effects on the screen
some reading magazines doing some web browsing probably
you're going to enjoy the 8.9 inch more probably
it's just a lot more immersive when you get a bigger screen
you know that they've never made an application for that
obviously this wouldn't be the product for you again
Shaun's Nelson here from fantastic anatomy and in today's video
I'm not trying to draw lightly or anything like that
I don't know I assume that's from more poor construction
this is the one thing that has quote-unquote broken air
these things is a little plastic piece that broke off
this thing is made of some like futuristic super material
I just wrap the cable around it and stick it in my bag
this is a really solid piece of equipment
these are the buttons like that you can program to whatever
I don't know like it seemed exactly the same as the companion
I don't know I guess if you hold it like that you can
it's not the it might not be as good as the companion to
I'll mention is that the cable is really nice and long
it's fine you could have it on your lap
the computer in front of you aways it's fine
sorry about the dirtiness but it just goes to show that you know
I'm showing you this is how I use it
I think that covers all the bases so basically actually let me
a whole tablet was like warped a little bit or cracked or bent
I can't imagine that could never really happen with this
you'd have to put it through to crack or bend it
I don't know if I already mentioned this
but the pen of the bamboo did not feel
but um but it's really convenient and easy just kind of going like this
if you like it you might like it bigger
it makes it more convenient to make like a long line
let me know in the comments down below and peace
IPS display it comes with Android 9pi with no bloatware it's got three
gigs of RAM 32 gigabytes of storage expandable up to 128 gigabytes
please use those links because it helps me keep purchasing products
we'll go ahead and just put that aside for just a second here
I can tell you it has some really good weight
it's got a nice metal backing on it like
I said before it has a really good weight to it
so let's go and talk about the build quality real quick like
I said before it does have some weight to it
it's not super light but it's not super heavy as well
the whole backing of this as well as the sides is made of aluminum
I am starting up the tablet and there's really minimal light bleed
this is the first screen that you see so the first thing
I want to touch on for the UI is the smoothness
I really don't have any complaints as far as the UI
know right in front of you and a fairly quiet environment
we're go ahead and let you listen to the sound here
play one of my videos so we are at full volume right now like
I said it definitely is loud enough for your personal listening
the battery life on this tablet is also pretty good for my testing
you're going to have to manually go into the settings and lower and higher
I think it's a pretty good size for what it is
it is a little bit thicker than the galaxy but again to me
that's really really not a determining factor or whether or not
it's not super thick and it's not super thin
I think it's perfectly fine for what you need to use it for
I've already added some apps and everything but as you can see
if you look at my little logo down here you can perfect
it doesn't get super bright and bright enough to where you can you know
see everything easily in direct sunlight but for the majority of the time
it does definitely download quicker than the 2 point 4 gigs
and it's definitely quick enough for pretty much
everything's running pretty smoothly as you can see
G I just kind of want to show you what it was looking like
this is on the lowest setting so it's still definitely playable
there is just a little bit of lag
it's not super bad so you can still definitely play it
I think are even better than the video capture another thing
I was really surprised at is during charging and usage of this tablet
I've got something new for the f-150 as I did in the last video
they do not have anything in the box at least not the box
I got so you're pretty much on your own
of course up here okay and it works out fine
everything works just like it's supposed to that way
I don't know what's gone with this thing
Play Store which is pretty cool for this particular unit
I'm not one thing I haven't figured out yet is
it has lots of abilities as far as cameras
there's two different kids one for automatic one for without but
does this where you can change two different types of media now
video is the same story as the music pretty much
it looks for local files and it'll play them
the screen actually looks better than the stock screen
I can't figure out how to change it yet
although it is pretty interesting how you can see me super our
fault ones which is not many of et cetera etc
but again not all out there like another double feature
you don't need to hook any of the stuff that comes up with this
I can't remember how to get to her at this second
this doesn't work but I don't know if I won
there's a lot of over screens that happen in this
for instance let's see if this will work doesn't always work
I mean this thing isn't perfect but it is pretty cool
I don't know I really divided on it
what do you think this thing is worth
I got to hear from you guys cuz really
but the wow factor let me know what you think guys sorry
hey guys are you doing top here here
like you're also tablet not also tablet but tablets
that stellar turned out to be amazing in the long run and vice versa
I thought was going to be very promising
gameplay that is so without further ado let's get to the tablet so
what the [ __ ] happened so this is what happened
um so that's that uh the tablet product itself
ok um has a bunch of like inputs on the other side here
whatever that is we call it the indication
you have no idea how much I love these
I'm not sure if you can see it here
not really sure because the color is the hill now that I see it
not some kind of like weird ass dick that
I that I have to just move around for the tablet pen usage
it's a g5 40 84 30 pen that comes with it
warranty whatever extension if you like to like share on facebook thanksgiving card
that has like a bunch of thank-you messages to you
we probably won't need if you know what
you won't need if you know what you're doing a SD pen pen driver
10 didn't work so I could literally just rate the city and happen
probably how did you get to start with the work
I don't exactly know what I'm supposed to call it
so you peel it all because of sticker
oh one more thing he also gave you
this gave me this artist antifouling glove that they could use for drawing but
I'm not going to be drawing as for Oso gameplay it looks like this
it's probably ambidextrous although the logo is on BIA
on the top at the pump the other side
that's called via dorsal side for economical terms
how was it it wasn't like as great as I had expected to be
you have your hand kind of like you
that will so that was my like a grain of salt well using that
precise like momentum heavy stuff like also gameplay
I didn't think it was anything to be praised that you you so yeah
that was the overall breakdown of the tablet and before
I go I just wanted to give you a very very last minute
like review of this entire product as to what
I don't understand what they did here is
I know I do understand what I did here
I've complained multiple times to many different companies
it feels like the pen not like a stick
the holder is a touch in the receivers
there it's very low profile which you know
it's kind of like standard for most wireless products and this loop here although
yeah so if you do have any questions leave your comments down below
please don't forget to like the video if you liked it
please do subscribe if you really like the video
kids were quite excited when it arrived and it comes in its case
so this is the tablet as you can see it comes in
you just pop your speed part into there so
it's not gonna get too damaged if it's dropped or which obviously happens
my daughter dropped it quite a few times
because they won't they'll have to have it if they want to understand
it'll need to be like this but it's you know
um the only other thing really would be that
the camera on the device is not amazing but again
I don't think it will be that much of a problem
I really hope you found this short video helpful
and if you'd like to read my full review of the new generation

Davian Bell founder ghost either forces a teammate and game designer
I'm here doing a review for a new tablet that he just ordered
sylvan has the same version that I just bought and right
I open this thing up and take the box out of the box
I have to Inglot just right in order to use it in
let me get this open and I'll show off what it could do
oh my god try the camera quality is it anyway uh
we go so this cost around very sleek design very thin
it's not that big as you can see but trust me when
I say it's just exactly the right size meter for the job
I guess I could put the pin in here
so you know you can just use any
yeah oh it comes with an extension cord
but there's the pin your wireless you know
I'll shut that off a bit later right now
I'm gonna get something right now not quite ready to uh well
I don't know so what does this help with
I'm about to open up paint or sign-in show off some of this stuff
press the star on the keyboard to open up any tool
today i have another tablet review from gamo this time
they sent me a tablet a while ago which i gave away
there was another box i should have known go ahead
inch ips screen 8192 pressure levels and a 1080p resolution
and that's just a start if you care about storytelling
no matter what you like raid's got something for you
raid's the hottest mobile game around and it's only getting bigger
the main event is already here the doom tower
a bunch of secret challenge rooms and 12 seriously badass bosses to take on
in the tower the raid team are giving away a super special champion bulwark
if you want to get a huge head start in raid
so i'm assuming it's tailored more for right-handed people to me
the stand works really well and the angle could be adjusted
i really like this tablet and i'm actually thinking of keeping it
we're going to be uploading little animations and renders like these on instagram
it's the easiest way to get in touch with us
thanks for watching and hopefully we'll see you in the next animation you
whoa hang on hang on a second oops uh wrong channel
sorry guys let me fix that real quick
thank god i don't have a pimple anymore
you can see that i have a temple
yeah this is pretty different from my usual content
considering for the fact that it's animation and gotcha edits but yeah
honestly i still can't believe i have this thing with me
we're gonna be going to another family day since it's sunday again
in the last vlog we went to the restaurant
this is our living room by the way
this house is actually older than my dad
we actually stopped at a restaurant because we are actually gonna get something
okay let's see how this goes say hi to the camera
so uh for a lucky subscriber we will give away shout out
ask that to mr beast not me man
okay since everybody is done i guess it's the perfect time to unbox
good thing you make animations not unboxing videos exactly
i'm rick there's rick hey should i read this aloud
some 100 000 subscribers 100 after all there are countless other times
you all see you in the next video right you
well you can do so all you have to do is long
show google app so now when you go to the left
so let's say you're getting a youtube notification
then you're going to see a little gear icon
then you just hit apply and it's going to go ahead and do that
that's how you would actually create your folders now
swipe down one more time and you're gonna see this icon
that looks blue with a person's head in it
then go into your option where it says home screen layout right here
i don't have to swipe up but it does feel a little bit more
clean this way to be completely honest with you
this app called add guard and basically what it does is block
is that this device does get the the security software support
stability it's in about 204 megabytes for the download
it's going to access the split screen window
let's go ahead and hit chrome so you you can
it'll come up here on the window and this is the model
i have the 149 model but i recommend the 199 model
what you're going to do is locate wallpapers app
that's like the grand canyon but you could set up the frequency of it
then once you do that you have enabled daily wallpapers
another thing that this device does have is dolby
you can lock the device and things of that nature
another thing that we have is raised to wake and double tap to wake
where the phone or tablet i mean will adapt to the outdoor conditions
so if it's light outside it will get brighter
if it's indoors it will get lower in the light as well another thing
here it is so you may want to save some information for later
you can actually um you know record the screen right here with this button
it's saying right here but you get to you
get this toggle where you can move it around
this device also does have screen cast right here
there is another app that i use for things like instagram
um screen assistant is pretty cool right here
blue light filter for your eyes or change
when you hit the arrow you can turn on screen right
slide it to this side and now you can pretty much
usually in the middle of the night is best fit
you could do it around you know like three
is this option inside of the battery settings
you won't be able to be disturbed by the apps that you choose
so let's say you wanted to put um instagram on that list
maybe um you know just you wanted to just you know
my name is alex and welcome back in today's video
that's paired with 3 gigs of ram and 32 gigs of internal storage
the tablet comes in a decent looking box on the front of the box
we have the usbc charging cable and the power adapter
well that's not the case with this one
we have the power button and the volume keys at the bottom
we have two speakers so luckily we get two speakers of this tablet
so if you want to plug in some headphones you can
that comes in the box is done in just under four hours
the tablet does great for social media apps
the maximum resolution of course is 1080p for any videos
so that's what you get with a budget tablet like this
so should you buy a tablet like this
you're getting one of the best screens on any tablets
i mean i haven't seen any other cheap tablets that have a screen
hopefully you enjoyed this video if you did like it
don't forget to subscribe and i will see you guys in the next one
I'm giving away in two contests and the other one
it ended up being used around our house so anyway
these are the basic specs of the unit
probably one of the main downsides to this unit 9 is display
and so that's pretty much toast with connections three-and-a-half millimeter headphone jack
the case is quite a few people here in the house
it's a little bit heavier than other tablets that we have
the one gig of ram and no bluetooth is an issue for me personally
I'm playing there what can I tell you
I mean it's a it's an Android tablet
it's a really good value if it had two kids of
RAM I think it would be a fantastic value but for what it is
I think they're great so I'm gonna give the proscan
let's see rating a rating out of five again for the price
- A few months ago, I reviewed my first color
Unfortunately for me, you folks are a vocal audience.
Obligatory shout out to the old YotaPhone, rip.
That E-Paper screen has a name, Kaleido Plus.
It's the latest generation of E ink from the company of the same name.
Seeing it after sunset depends on an integrated front light
Watching Lisa from Mobile Tech review cover the company's Note
that model's thin metallic construction and stylish orange piping.
anchoring the display, there's nothing remarkable about it.
Now you can replace it with a launcher of your choice
At its slowest it's your typically E reader
It's almost fast enough to watch a quick video.
but on this high contrast, highly power efficient display.
just leave the display on the fastest setting all the time?
and it's a much bigger issue on a color panel like this.
when used with the stylist that comes in the box.
And the software overall is responsive and very customizable.
you have to use this needlessly complex ribbon of hieroglyphics.
It's not difficult or dangerous, but it is still just another speed bump.
that's impressive but for me falls a little short of justifying its price.
But you know that's not the only competition.
Euro, assuming that display tech is all it's cracked up to be.
if that's the kind of video you'd like to see more of.
android tablets are in this really weird place right now
nobody is going to beat the ipad when it comes to popularity
yes fifty dollars but is it worth it
gigahertz cpu with one gig of ram to say
it's an all plastic tablet with a really basic design
you can't expect much for 50 and you can really see
uh and at least it has a headphone jack
the charging port is another area where you can see that
it has one bottom firing speaker as well which is horrible
i guess um but it just sounds really muffled
fire os is completely different from just regular android in fact
you won't even find google play services on this tablet
but that might be more work than it's actually worth
hulu disney plus is also on the amazon app store
it only comes with 16 gigs or 32 gigabytes of storage
you can really raise the storage capacity up quite a bit
you're gonna have all of amazon's services already installed they're pre-installed on this tablet
it's kind of a cluttered and complicated mess
they kind of throw all of that at you
so that's something that this tablet has over the ipad
well i have to keep going back to the price tag keep in mind
if you have children that tend to break things
because it's all plastic but it's only 50 dollars
i don't know if i could say that more
i probably said that about 10 times already
but you have to keep that in mind when you're considering purchasing this tablet
it's so cheap that of course it's worth it

hi in skyyy and welcome to hardware heaven today
we are going to be taking a look at the wiki pad gaming
it is a mobile gaming tablet with a built in and removable controller
I'm gonna start with what we've got inside the box then
we of course have the wikipad tablet which is a 7 inch
it pretty much works exactly the same way
it's a pretty standard tablet if anything it looks like a giant galaxy
fine it's a similar size to that of the iPad Mini
Google Chrome you can go to the Google Play Store
it all works perfectly fine your calendar etc etc
we do have some additional game options on here for example
my particular favorite is a game called a Reaper
it's completely free up to a level 10
it's always the ice storm test that you'll run
I'll always pay attention to is how responsive it is as you can see
I can slide on the tablet with complete ease
it's very responsive there's no latency or lag when pressing any buttons
occasionally there is a little bit of graphics lag
but that's just a little picky thing on my behalf
you have to bear in mind that this is mobile games
this is a mobile gaming device for games that you can find on
App Store's that you would normally play on something like your phone
I really like the way they have designed it
so you're getting that out not having to worry about draining
I'd much prefer it to the ones with the kind of controller
and then you attach a tablet or a phone on top
it looks unstable and it doesn't look like the products on its own
I don't think looks very nice so I hope you liked this review
leave a like and subscribe to this channel
if you've enjoyed this video and I'll see you next time bye
which is the nova 3 color so for the remainder of this video
we're just gonna leave it up to you guys to look at it
see how you like the vibrancy the color saturation everything else about it
meaning that does not look washed out from the side
video playback works well allowing you to stream
but they get the job done and work fine for a quick Skype call
the tablet also comes pre-loaded with the mobile versions of Word Excel and PowerPoint
is it very easy to transport and the familiar
Windows 10 interface allows you to use your favorite applications to get work done
this is literally just as I love unboxed
it turned it on and this is what we've what we've actually got so
so that's no great issue first impression it comes across
I know interestingly we've got a an update of stop button there
we've got some current updates to fix any inevitable
bugs are gonna be an ongoing issues so yeah big tick
so one of the new features of the tech
so let me just show you how to set that up
if we go to settings here somewhere fingerprint right
I've already put two but I'll do it again
now it's a case of just keeping moving you finger around lift finger
then touch the sensor again you'll fingerprint detected
we keep doing this until we manage to to fill up the bar
my hands of it sweat is exceptionally hot here today
there we go back on so yeah great function and certainly
the package is this which appears to be a standard
what this is actually is why we have lost it there
we are on the edge with the with the speaker
don't get confused about it's only for for you actual micro SD card
I just want to talk about the charger
but it doesn't actually mention that it is actually the fast charger so yes
Express charger with five seven nine and 12 volt amperes
the the processor that's fitted is a 64-bit mediatek mt6752 except for playing games
let's just have a look at the the pros with it one
the speaker or your speakers on it dual stereo speakers
I think for the first time certainly first tablet
I've had it's light enough to use without using a Bluetooth speaker
the cameras are always always have been a compromise on this tablet
they're not they really are good photographs certainly for talking online talking to friends
there's GPS installed as well and the battery life
I suspect it will probably run for about ten hours
we'll save a future model down the line with the SIM card fitted again
so so that for me just using it on the
Wi-Fi is absolutely fine so overall impressions with it
I can't really fault it in any way
I'm struggling to find anything to actually fall with this tablet at all
I've got a bit of a different thing
streams are probably already familiar with the sound of my voice
that aren't well annoying so not too long ago
huion approached me to review one of their graphic drawing tablets now
quick little background on me if you're not familiar with my channel already
I'll be reviewing for this video is the QE on Inspira q1
1k before we get into the pros and cons and speed painting whatnot
I wanted to quickly go over the boxing now
packaging aesthetics hold no bearing on the actual quality of the product
I know but I really appreciate a pretty box
the drawing surface of this tablet is silky smooth
I don't know how else to really describe it
drawing on it is such a pleasant tactile experience
it's nearly eight times more sensitive which is crazy considering
know delay and feedback but it is as responsive as responsive can get
I never felt like the brush was lagging behind or jumping around
the q1k has an active area of around 11 by 7 inches
which to me is just about perfect not too big that
is cat hair in the bottom of the pen
holder is a little piglet compartment for keeping all of the eight extra pen
I don't travel with my tablet that often but I've dealt with enough USB
one of the features of the physical tablet is a shortcut
lock that when toggled disables the other shortcut buttons on the the tablet surface
which if you're like me and have a nasty habit of accidentally pressing
those buttons is really convenient and now on to the cons unfortunately
it's not too big of a problem but it can be a little inconvenient
the pen was not battery-powered it just was it just existed
I'm no stranger to charging my digital devices
the pen does not have an eraser side
it's not too big of an issue for me
those pin buttons are just really easy to accidentally press
my last issue happened near around the end of my picture
the pen would spaz and duplicate layers and shift stuff around
I am overall very pleased with my experience
this was a ox-head - and you can see here
it's one flat smooth surface and I'll talk about that a little bit
we've got the pan of course we've got the
is these little accessories which we're going to jump into
I'll show you exactly how to do that right now
what you want to do is just tap on here
instead of that long one we used to have its countries
the other thing we've got is these nice little rings
I don't know maybe I want to put some red on there
I can identify this pin because it has a little red
it's going to paint now one of the things
I'm noticing because this thing is over 8,000 levels of pressure sensitivity
there's a ton of different things you can have it to do
those we've got a front and a back button here so I'm going
click the back button said to the brush tools
well what are those brush tools going to do now
we can move this around and we can do different things with it there
we've got many things we can do with the touch
let me just using my finger right now
there's a lot of other things we can bring up other controls
and there's a bunch of different things you can do here
so you can customize some of these gestures which is pretty awesome
so here's the thing we can add different applications in here and have these
what if you want to cool it okay
so we've got the touch ring and you can see you know
there's the toggle there in the middle we can have it do different things
so there's plenty of in-depth things on how to use the tablets there what
you need to get a tablet because without a tablet
you can do a lot of things but there's no pressure sensitivity
you can't do shading when you have a pressure-sensitive tablet such as this
this is the tool you want to get and so
I would recommend this one without any reservation
I love the fact that works wirelessly the Bluetooth is no lag
of course you can plug it in if you want
I'm probably not going to plug it in
in fact one of the things I hate about the new MacBook
Pro is the touchpad so I'm probably gonna
what do you think are you using a
is this something you want so anyway guys
hey guys just a quick forward before we actually start the video
it seems to be their new entry-level beginner tablet
so not only is the cheapest emotional sports well tablet
it's also the replacement for my old tablet so
I'm going to be comparing it to a lot in this review
everything I said was completely honest because I don't believe in
it looks so much smarter on the desk underneath this
and you get this nice little you know carton inside of this
Mac adapter the HDMI and USB leads for your computer as well as the
it's a combined lead so it also plugs into your tablet
anything past 2011 needs a new adapter but I'm not sure speaking of adapters
I'm using the United Kingdom pin set because I live in the UK
next up is my favorite feature of this entire box
USB that comes with the pack and this actually connects the USB adapter
turn the plug socket on and your tablet
a set up for the tablet was also incredibly easy
you simply go to their website and download
it was a major major difference to the extra pen artists hats
it has six sort cookies and one touch bar
the touch pad seemed to be a popular feature within tablets
these days and that is by no means an issue
it's very light and it's definitely a wonderful tablet to work with
this image one is a companion piece to the artwork
I'm used to having to do it through the pen barrels
it feels so much more actually stood drawing experience
unfortunately but it did get me about it
you're upgrading from a pad tablet of this is your first tablet
this is definitely a fantastic option to go with
obviously if you don't want to spend out this much money
kicking the buck here and given how sturdy and improve this design looks
I think it'll be far far more when it comes to the artist
I really have to say on the table overall
I think it's a fantastic piece of care and great for any beginner
10's new actually cost more than this tablet
did it was 300 pounds for the artist 10s
meanwhile this was only a hundred ninety-nine at full price
my office 10s and continues to function just fine for my art is 12
I hope you enjoyed the video don't forget to
Like and subscribe and let's art by nature out
hi Dave Taylor here again and this time
I'm looking at the Samsung Galaxy Tab E
that's this and this is a just barely under 10 inch tablet
and you have to actually subscribe through your cellular service
so this is really nice it also being part of the Samsung line
Wow that'd be great for my kids and here's what's great
Samsung actually has something called kids mode and kids mode
this does your audio jack cool okay and it also supports
that's really all you need to know except for one really cool thing
how much would you pay for this tablet
probably you're going to say a lot more than it costs
so you can pick one up for yourself through samsung comm or this particular
what's up guys chicks here bringing you a review for the connect 7
3.5 millimeter jack mini HDMI micro SD card slot and the charger port
let's open to something is urging the browser
what's unique about this device is the solid-state drive
it didn't boot to ten seconds but 11.6
that's pretty fast full up faster than my PC
life is around 6 hours depending on what you're doing on
here's the Microsoft App Store so you got all the latest apps
they're all the free apps and the paid apps which is really good
play the games play very well on this
today we're taking a peek at the dragon
hey folks welcome back to techgooch and today
i haven't done one for a while and if nothing else that gets me
that's going to compare to my ipad pro right
i'm actually going to be comparing this to like the fire
um there's going to be other ones out there as well
in that regard it does have an ips
i really wanted to see how it did
compared to like the iphone 10 iphone 10s
so i'm going to show you that here in a second
here's how you do how you do this
how you unlock make sure you activate your warranty
and that's where the sd card goes is right down in that slot
i'm not going to go through the apps
this is more on the on the tablet performance itself
um it's pretty much running uh almost stock version of it
um i don't do a whole lot with android and you know
now i used geekbench 5 for its results
uh and so we can go with that right now
if you can you know the 5th gen ipad ran
but if you look at device to device uh samsung galaxy a7 lg g2
um but that's kind of what you're thinking so for 139 bucks
it's what you would expect good for browsing good for watching videos
does you know it's similar to those older devices
i'm probably in the few weeks that i've been using it
uh camera's not too bad um it's it's a 140 tablet
it's not too it's not bad it really isn't um i wouldn't hesitate
i mean i could show you how it runs on this
i mean yeah we could watch a movie together
um but it's not crazy amazing and the screen itself
it is nowhere near the cost of that thing
data systems uh we have jeff teague from honeywell today
and we're going to discuss the new honeywell rt10 tablet jeff
you can get either or the android side is running mobility edge
that honeywell has a couple things that are unique about
it are include well number one the mobility edge but number two
we have a short range and a long-range scanner in this thing
the other thing is is unlike some of the commercial grade tablets
so you don't have to send the battery in if it should fail
jeff thank you very much for coming today
hi everyone this is to welcome to yet
this is the packaging box for the star
0 6 wireless tablet as you can see
my box did not arrive in a very good condition
it's pretty smashed up but thankfully there's no physical damage to the tablet
let's take a look at the key features of this tablet
let's take a look at the things included
this is the USB Drive with Windows and Mac driver on it
is that a manual and the resist glove here
Photoshop brush sizes or zoom in and zoom out
when you turn this you can turn it and clockwise or counterclockwise
overall the design is very clean and simple
this is the working area ten by six inches
there there's loop here that can hold a pen
this is how it looks like when the pen is in the loop
I feel that this is a bit fragile
I seldom ever use this on the back
there are six rubber feet and this is where the battery is
this is the power toggle switch for the tablet
I like the fact that this is removable
so if there's anything wrong with the battery you can replace it very easily
the pen areas rather lightweight feels sturdy enough
here's a bit hollow as well but I think it's good enough
you just have to push it in and choose the pen at an angle
if you are left-handed you can change it here
how the tablet is going to map on to the monitor so
you can still draw with a pen no problem at all all right
so let's try to see the pressure sensitivity works
I can see some light and jitter select jitter there so not 100% smooth
let me zoom into 400 again so all those jitter
this is good mr. illustrator cs5 on the Mac
the dry surface is quite smooth but it has a slight tactile
feel which feels really good when drawing on it this is
here you can also use the scroll wheel to change the brush size
there are some features for example with illustrator
drawing they are really minor issues are not do breakers so overall
I think this is a pretty decent tablet
I will put a link in the video description below
see you in the next video bye you
so the tablet that they said to me is a 15 inch tablet display
it's a screen that you can draw on
I just wanted to take a little peek okay
I already smell it I already smell the newness
you can't express yourself through language just express yourself with art
wait so this tablet is geared towards a all levels of artists
then here's the tablet very nice and fit a very portable
oh hell yeah look at that display so upon first inspection
it looks like there's a lot of buttons here
but maybe that's what you want as an artist
I don't know I guess we'll see what I'm drawing tap
it's pretty light but this is like cool
let's do it so this is my voice outside of first secret
this is a little speedrun of me drawing a camera boot
this is someone who won the 10k raffle that
I had months ago and I finally am drawing his persona so thank you
Rennick for letting me draw your fur soda
you can do that or if you want to have it tilted up to
I would have to press down a little bit harder for
where if you're just like barely touching the screen
I did not have that problem with my previous tablet so I think that's
man as far as the eraser toggling I was talking about earlier
that actually turned out to be really nice
it would not erase it anymore for this pen
that took some getting used to but once
it made it make things a lot easier
I'm just agree to kind of like it
I don't see the use of the touch capabilities
because you're not able to pan with this pen
I've been using my my trackpad to do that
I thought it would draw if that makes any sense
I didn't know where my pen was landing on
but it wasn't really that major of a problem
it was just kind of a something that bugged me
I'm traditional so I wore the glove and it
okay one of the one of the big things that I also noticed was
it was a little bit of a step down
the painting is just 2d right but then once you start shading
I actually don't think I really had many problems with it
I've been trying to do this whole time
so this tablet I think it's on Amazon for $379 I believe or 399
the foreign dollar tablet 15 inch display right
so is this article tablet worth the money
I had a lot of fun drawing with this tablet
if you want to be a pro artist like myself just give this tablet
this is the drawing this is a the handsome caribou
Rennick and I had a lot of fun drawing him
all for sending me your tablet to review
swipe down from the top right and tap
Netflix or YouTube videos while the 8 inch screen is fine for Android
you'll find the power and volume keys as well as a headphone jack mini
USB charging port and micro SD card slot
we have the tablet display perfectly secured with foam along with
this comes the box which carries the components that make tablet function
half of the power adapter the pen itself a vga cable hdmi cable
i can explain also if you open up the back
you'll notice that there's multiple nips just in case you lose him
that is when i noticed that the other pen was again
the fact that it has multiple programmable shortcuts 20 to be exact
it has a full 21 inch drying display
watch yes i know a lot of you are asking
it's only been available for a few weeks yet on Amazon
it has tons of five-star reviews with an average of 4.7
does it really live up to the hype
how does it compare to the similarly priced Kindle Fire HD 10
I'll also be sharing my first impressions on design and build quality
I do like that it has that older gen iPad
No sabore but that's nothing unusual at this price bottom
nice and clear great colors but as you can probably see
I'm unable to leave the house to get a haircut right now
the rear and front facing cameras are decent enough for your average
Call of Duty mobile and pub G mobile
Netflix and YouTube has been totally fine performance
it is more than equipped for browsing the internet reading
pretty much everything there that your average consumer would want a tablet for
technically you're not even buying an Android tablet with the fire 10 HD
it is literally like accessing the internet through an Amazon billboard
of course there is a way to get around this and install
HD will never be straight out of the box
hey what is up guys this is Alex from answered Tech and today
and then down below that you have a black bar with the
you have the ability to change different settings such as pointer speed or double
click speed if you're planning on using this tablet as a trackpad
lastly you have settings for your radial menu
Wacom tablet is multi-touch so you have the ability to complete gestures in Photoshop
for example such as rotating the canvas and zooming in and out
I bought the Intuos pen and touch tablet mostly for photo editing
they can hold it and grip it really well
my kids are better at this than me
and so that's some of the things you can do
it is connect it to wi-fi and it's ready
at 360 now this right here is the matrix pad s8 from
and so much more that we will discuss in today's video
it's very lightweight and for me that means
I have a lot more room in my tech bag
Keogh for connecting and sending this tablet out to me for review
I mainly use my tablets for reading magazines checking my email
I was happy to give it a try so inside the box
but we'll come back to that in just a minute also
it's composed of a light plastic backing with a matte finish
USB port the SD card slot and the headphone jack
alright let's go ahead and quickly run down the specs out of the box
you get an 8 inch screen 12 1280 by 800 hi-def IPS display
and for those of you who don't know
alright the tablet also has a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core processor
gigs of storage expandable up to 128 gigs
ok so I know I gave you some specs
but let's go ahead and actually unlock the tablet
so it's given me the extra storage space
they'll let you know that this is a quad-core 1.3
and some other things down here display display touch the screen resolution the network
the 5 gigahertz band is not supported on this device
I I guess I've had this been using this for the last three days
let's go ahead and turn that down there
very nice and then have some other information down here
I actually have to take something like this to push it in there
and so we'll have that clicks all stay in place so
these are your quick settings you have your Wi-Fi connection your Bluetooth
do not disturb auto-rotate smart saving mode airplane mode icon for it
give this a shot for the sake of this video
the rear camera will yield the best quality in photos and videos
even though the black guy can go first
okay now as you can see the videos in pictures
i don't know how to make intros though before we could start
they just sent me this tablet for free for me to review
precious box contains the tablet itself with a few
it also has the back for the tablet
this bag that contains the extra pen nibs inside
that doesn't mean because my phone is small
it doesn't work for ios so sorry apple users
it won't work for you so yeah onto the video though
so the 10 has 8192 level pressure sensitivity which is big enough
and it also has eight express keys and one touch ring
i do love the rubber part of the pen
now you have the tablet we gotta download the drive of course though
i'm going to be drawing while using the tablet with fire alpaca
let's start off with how i became a sans fan girl
i was also that kid that watches vines
i didn't know what i was going to
but i clicked on it anyway because it had the word funny on it
funny how minecraft youtubers now are also using that strategy to get views
don't you think though after that i got curious on what undertale is so
it also came across that uh sans anonymous comics
where sans would just flirt with a person
uh so that happened but everything's all normal
we should probably speak in english but they said i didn't joking
don't know uh so like some days came by uh when they transferred
i noticed that this particular student was drawing a character
none other than betty from glitchtale with me peeking behind her
i went back to my suit with a panic
drawing undertale made me inspired to draw more undertale and so i did
it was really fun to know that someone related to me
i've seen fandoms and not really undertale and other things as well
puns rude for snails and eating spaghetti was the most special meal back then
i was 11 to 12 like 11 turning 12.
this is why you don't go to the internet when you're still young kids
i went undertale peasants oc because of course i was really lazy
uh as i remember she was made for us to cringe at
i don't even know what what i would say about it
they're so cute together they said and i reply
oh no no no no no uh it was a dare for my cousin
i didn't want to do it but i did it anyways
hey the whole cousin thing wasn't true it was all me
that's the whole story of young me being all done
even though i am still dumb till this day i am still very hot
thank you for staying till the end of the video
if you want to know who that friend i was talking about
i will put their twitter in the description so please follow them
by the way spooky s1 has edited edited
all of this so please sure make sure to subscribe to her
this is the drawing i made with using the tablet
thank you to galman for sponsoring this video
i would like to talk to you guys for a screen tablet
excuse me i am begging you for a screen tablet
I'm going to do a little bit of a gear review
3 which was a great tablet for me
I would lose connection so it had to go
not only is have the quick buttons for using quick configurations
I can basically use my finger to control the mouse
I can use two fingers to right-click I can use
three fingers left to actually change to a different window
that are pretty cool about this tablet again
what those buttons are configured for so right now in
Photoshop I have it set up for duplicate layers
there's a shift button if I come down here to the bottom buttons
I don't like this change that it did so four fingers up
so it's really cool the customization and it's insane
I can toggle between the different colors or right-click there
I want to save this file for any changes that I've done
you have all kinds of standard gestures that'll do and again
and then it can double click to tap and click
and then you've got zoom and rotate options by pinching
and closing your fingers and you can also rotate your images as well so
I turned that option off because I found my camera here
I found that a little bit annoying with the rotate option
especially if you're trying to zoom in or zoom out
three fingers left or right will navigate to different windows
all the customizations that you can do with this
after having this tablet you may not even use a regular mouse anymore
I haven't experienced any problems like that at all
I think it's just a fabulous tablet fabulous tablet in value
there's some plugins and some trial versions of Corel Painter
we'll have more videos coming at you soon
this is your guy cly and welcome back to budget buys today
I want to talk to you about the Vaughn Kyo matrix pad s7
oh but they are not sponsoring this video everything
let's go ahead and crack this box open and see what's inside
what you're actually here for is the tablet itself
so let me go ahead and rattle off some specs at you
the microUSB port and underneath this protective flap
you have the rear-facing camera as well as the speaker grille now
I know some of you are probably wondering about the audio quality
you can expect out of the past seven and four that
you're going to be able to pick up on a lot more
it's actually a very competent device as you've probably already expected
most surprisingly is the fact that the on-screen controls were incredibly comfortable to use
I tend to hate those things and if I can
this game is a grid-based first-person dungeon crawling RPG
which just so happens to be a favorite genre of mine
you're good to go one of the other main things
I've been using this tablet for is text not only have
glass this allows for bright and full colors again
this device is hitting the market with an intention of collaboration equipped with premium
Bang & Olufsen audio and a world facing three multi array mic one thing
hello fingerprint security a pin and passwords as with the majority of new
HP devices another thing I do like though this model we reviewed didn't house
I would like to see become more readily available in future
we found seven to eight hours to be more accurate
Like and subscribe if you enjoyed the video until the next time
they build a complete ecosystem of products around their tablets
for example behind me here and I'll just scroll across there
you can access them via ethernet and all sorts of things
that's built into this tablet so really really good on power
we found that this device ran a full day for us on Friday
you can do that while the unit is running
here this area here you can see is modular
a lot of people seem to accept this form of authentication more basically in
Wacom pen this pen will be fine for taking a lot of notes
Wacom pens just above that big improvement for motion on this device
you probably take take it into the shower with you if you wanted to
there which is pretty cool so you can see this device here
but of course you can if you need to run
the you know the new modern applications to full screen touch applications
that's probably more than enough in terms of screen resolution
we'll have a look at how the tablet performs as a note-taking device
those are just between touch and pen really easy the great thing about the
I hope that's giving you a quick overview of the motion r12
they don't have any calluses on them or anything like that
so that's kind of how that came about
the MSRP is about $150 to that end
I also have gotten a budget oriented tablet case
I've actually been using this without a case for quite some time
I just said I wanted to get a case
I got this one from the new egg market place
Asus one so I'll be doing a quick unbagging or whatever of this
so let's start off with the why question
I buy this product well basically doing what I do
I've never really been all that interested in the premium tablets
I personally see this as more as an occasional use device
it's not really a PC replacement for me
I was like oh well that seems pretty reasonable
you can add up to 64 gigs more depending on your preference powering
BG and the Wi-Fi only has a single 2.4
Bluetooth and GPS integrated size-wise at 7.7 inches by 4.7 inches by 0.4 inches
Asus is providing the center 480 of colors
this is the blue one which has a matte finish
USB port a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack a micro SD card slot
and then you also have volume and power buttons
I'm not ecstatic about the placement of these
that's not really what I bought it for
you also have the ability to do floating apps and widgets which
I have actually used this for so far here at home
this is primarily web browsing while sitting on the couch
so it's nice for watching videos and stuff or just play music
you can use the app to control media center or Windows Media Center
well not having to use the computer than benchmarking on so it's usually
I'll talk about the build build quality and the build quality is okay again
you're not going to find the sort of rubberized finished or the really sturdy
you're not going to be blown away by it or anything
I will notice some slowdown and some stutters here and there
I would even really complain about if I wasn't doing
Asus will list up to ten but I found closer to eight
he did a video of it over on awesomesauce news so check at least
I know he got it if he didn't do a video on it
but if you enjoyed this video don't forget to click the like button
I appreciate all the words I appreciate you guys watching this video as well
there's no battery in the keyboard and you can see that
this model has a backlit keyboard not all models do
Acer positions the switch alpha 12 as a sort of laptop first device
which is the keyboard the front and the the kickstand itself so
Ikon core i3 skylake processor four gigabytes of RAM in 128 gigabytes of storage
you're using it to do playing games or doing other things that are really
I think on your lap but as a notebook it generally works pretty well
I like the keyboard which is pretty responsive
as soon as it's connected you can start typing now
I don't love about it is down here
the arrow keys are also the page down page up home and volume
there's six keys over here and that's something that
I found a lot of Acer laptops do the display is an IPS
they're really designed for Windows 10 and are downloaded from the Windows Store
so let's go ahead and fire up for instance the image editing application
I'm going to open a web browser so you can click multitasking
so we've got open here and it's a 2160 by 1440 pixels
of course use the touchpad and there is a precision touchpad below the keyboard
let's go ahead and file open image that
these little icons are pretty tiny and they'd be hard to touch the
I find it a little bit heavy to sort of hold for reading
is it going to be the best solution for everybody not necessarily
let's go ahead and type in my password
anything that you'd ever want to do with a Windows computer
this way is kind of hard there we go
video since we've got this high resolution screen
that's actually not what I wanted to do
I can get that tab to come out
let's do a 1080p video at the same time
i'm going to go through all the features
um i'm going to just go through a bit of a demo
go through the settings and see if it's worth purchasing this tablet
this is the first tablet that i've reviewed that
so you've got that nice protective case there
it also comes with a mouse here as well and which requires
so you've got that option so you've got two options there hold on
and that's the micro usb charging cable for the keyboard
okay now as you can see here it takes a 3.5 millimeters headphone
it has the usb type-c charging port and at the same time
it takes two sims so you take sim
it's easy to um close but closely as well but it's easy
there's a chance of actually losing that as well all the time
okay so they also give you a cleaning cloth everything so literally
this is the reason why i really like it
because of those reasons plus i love the build quality
i've already gone through the setup as well so bear that in mind
this is how it looks when it's um when it's done it's very smooth
the touchscreen is very smooth easy to use as well
now you've got all these things already built into your netflix
life is amazing on this it has 8 000 mah mah battery capacity
around 12 gig is already used up without downloading anything
but it's just a just how smooth it is
it has a very large speaker as well
and i think i've taken a picture as well
okay let me just go to camera first all right so that's the camera
decent mega pixels to do video calls and stuff
Journal and today we have the vacuum matrix pad z1 kids edition
it has a cute little wallpaper over here and it's pre-installed with kiddos
iPad isn't that pretty cool it also has
see if you want to change the wallpaper
so you can choose from many varieties of wallpapers
let's check out the apps that are already inside the iPad
we're going to give away a lot of Brian toys
I'm gonna play pizza party all right so this is cool camera features
and there's a front and back camera so let's try it out in this
did you really enjoy playing those awesome fun educational games
so what do you guys think about this
I recommend this for like like little kids first
we don't know but it could be the first to see our newest video
good bye and now for our giveaway question
the question is what is my favorite color
I'm green just comment down below what you think my favorite color
plus um this also means you have to watch your language so no cursing
this is going on youtube um anyways yeah
i tested it on stream by making a short animation in adobe animate
the resolution is 1920 by 1080 which is perfectly acceptable
the panel is a very nice looking lcd screen with etched anti-glare glass
the pen is battery free and it supports 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity
it goes into much more detail on the huian website something
i was a bit skeptical about but ended up
liking a lot about this tablet is that it doesn't have any shortcut keys
that is very nice to hold so much
that was a joke but it is a great pen
alright now let's jump into the cons first of all
this is the only annoying thing i've found out about this pen
i got it to move before it literally
maybe it's because my cursor was on the screen
but it was a small hiccup i encountered
so that's my take on the huian canvas with a k22 plus now
because that's the most important thing to do in any good review video
it's easy to set up has a nice big 21.5
and in the meh we have no shortcut buttons and a 1920x1080 resolution
i posted the animation that i made on twitter
we've seen a remarkable change in the plan of chinese goods
we can observe that change from the chuwi hi-pad lte pill too
the all-metal layout in grey color looks superior hiding its funding individuality
the back is easy to touch and also doesn't scratch quite easily
the rear has another design component with a little strip on the left side
coming to the front the chuwi hi-pad lte comes with a sizeable 10.1
while operating the pill nonetheless you can get used to the bezels
you've got a single usb type-c port using a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
that has a micro sd card choice too
plays the double job of shielding the 10.1
this chewy tablet computer is promoted as an amusement device
this weapon reproduces colors fairly well and functions even under the direct sun
applications because chewy made a decision to utilize a stock version of android 8.0
the chuwi ipad lte has its own set of issues
the computer keyboard case has difficulty maintaining the tablet in a vertical position
the camera is ordinary and charging the battery requires quite a while
kindly see the description for this amazon product link
there is no ball two of these is
now if this will do it it'll be worth its weight in
God I probably won't be much though seems to wait very very easily
I mean if there's actually anything in the box
sorry fog you buy on-board storage which probably will be about 1.4
five hours might be five hours on standby home
i think i'll have to actually test for this video
I 10 to 11 BG in a Wi-Fi capability 0.3
which your dad had to set up any neighborhood because he was awfully tired
let's unbox this beastie the trustee orange scissors which my wife doesn't know that
things which will hopefully and i'll use to survive the trip
then here you go fill your boots young man
hmm brillion party genius perrier award in making anyway
let's see what's inside this sucker so whipping off the lid bench wait
it's actually quite a robust box for the price
and you don't usually get robust stuff in robust boxes for cheap prices
it's impossible to transfer files to and from the tablet
if you kill it you've got to take it to the tip
oh my good stuff so yeah really rubbish
I'm not expecting too much goodness but then have a look
there's some kind of foam bag which is always good
and let's looky here no hang on we won't
let's have a look at the accessories first
we'll probably have a couple of these line around so stand
USB cable this must be the on-the-go cable it sure
bother opening the bag here but it's yep pretty much yeah USB adapter allegedly
we'll put that to one side and let us have a look
well nearly 40 acre who's counting ok so the front place is pretty good
let's have a look at the back a spade
he's got a lovely green sticker on it
you might get a reflection me and trust me
nobody wants that so busby sevens and busy busy bees
this is probably going to take ages having a bit of trouble focusing
oh now that was quicker than expected to be honest
no internet connection obviously and yeah android 40
settings browser email play music and must be apps
Play Store enabled so let's pop into apps and see what we come here
sounds a bit rude if you ask me
come back when I have charged the device back
because that's in the way of the wireless router
that was three monitors in the way my editing machine
Angry Birds Angry Birds download that it's free installed accept & download
I don't want to actually a door actually step away from the monetization process
I think it's cashing it to the SD card
you also got the back home apps list there
I don't even know who these people are
the camera is as you can imagine pretty poor ok
let's just move away from the main camera and we'll do that
good try to think what else we can show
i think that this tablet is excellent excellent value for money
I've put a little screen protector on here
that book 2 pounds of ebay all sorts of the normal things
who's going to try and sell me something immediately
that are you sure you want to exit
so well we'll just put that back pound
okay so cramped up beside your bed from there anyway
you have a budget device get to try skype on it
no reason to believe you won't look how to switch fine test
you can't be bothered to work it out
so let's just have a clip here for educational purposes only learn that film
Oliver yes Beauty has up straight into the action there
I won't take up any more of your time
the keyboard is going to be a selling point on this
we're going to look at it now so this is a windows
it's available with a variety of cpus from core i3 on the lowliest one
i mean given how small this screen is
i don't have anything against the surface type cover
it doesn't make kind of hollow funky sounds
it's not like typing on a netbook of old or something like that
the thinkpad is meant to be abused a bit
if you jump up and down on it you could break it
think shutter privacy shutters so nobody can spy on you
yeah that so the display on this again
i think that's fine for the display size
the color gamut on this is pretty good you get full srgb brightness
you can see those metrics on screen right now
so it's pretty good stuff you know palm rejection is reasonably good
it's probably not going to be your first pick
tilt support if you go with the tilt supporting pen either way
and if you do want to get the tilt sensing lenovo precision pen
it didn't get burning hot to the touch
this thing has some beefy hinges it stays nice and stiff it's infinite angles
you can even rest your hand on it some without it going drooping down
and there's an eight megapixel world-facing camera not bad quality
so that's not too bad battery life on this is ago
the resolution of the display might not be surface pro level
it's one of those netbook things have you ever thought to yourself hmm
you can successfully predict the future good for you
but you know be a bit impolite right
let's put that to one side for the second
it's far better built than the Android tablets
in fact it's got these sort of hard metal
II feeling plastic on the back but everything is a lot more solid
and there's no give anywhere around the whole thing a lot of the
oh look at that a SIM slot for putting in SIM cards
there is the microphone which begs the question
what is that light sensor or something presumably power button also sleep
oh yes this is what we like micro SD slot and yes
Oh just result on that off the camera I do apologize
you really glad you waited for that on you next up
nothing on the other side except some screws
Silver's right let's turn it on and have a play ok
7 to take ages to start on a tablet
Windows 7 has a built-in touchscreen II into Phase II thing
a little dot appears a little effect to show you where you tapped
what do you do if you want to input some text
need your daily dose of cute now of course
I don't don't be ridiculous as a web browser right
go on as I say it's kind of obscuring
the view however as with windows and all such things
you have a massive choice of third party keyboards you can install
you is stuffed kind of a king harp actually
I wanted to do a search for something important like me
we are easy web side not search for that anymore instead
Oh given half the chance I always do BAM there
not there's anything technically wrong the sound keyboard except it obscures
okay that's a bit touchscreen e so now
I suppose we can have to look at specifications
it doesn't ever miss your taps or anything
what else we got right screen size 1366 across 768 down
it's got an atom in 4 five process
the people and the dialogues it takes longer to calchas it scans
Hardware here we go device manager Knoll a performance device manager
it is an atom in four five five
SSDs you can buy and plug into your main PC
I suppose perhaps they eat too much battery or cost too
much money's or whatever so how does this actually play back video
well pretty well is the answer to that it's well
oh sorry shouldn't sing along as you can see
it plays nicely but can it play it
Commodore Amiga computer crashing anti clever let me know and piss off
I can get it to play em cavies up to about a DVD resolution
fine since you get to 720p territory it begins to choke on it
unless of course you've got everything in a non MKV format then
it seems to be fine and lovely and everything works like it should okay
it still seems to last about three hours
Ben failed to tell spider-man right next up webcam yes there's a built-in webcam
almost that's a little bit weird isn't it really
pop enough and hiss enough to make it go through the filter probably
I'm going to mention a program a specific program
this is what happens when you've got a keyboard
look it's like a special effect entron or something
I can't imagine this is a problem with the tablets as you know
I'll know it all ran a bit art
there we go it does actually select everything
we are not something to do very often
technical things avoiding the obvious elephant in the room
it doesn't destroy all the data already on your iPad
so yeah that's sort of good in that respect
is that a very little tablet specific software
Apple themselves have a new iPad coming out this year like I don't know
what do you want to do with it
oh wait we haven't gotten to price yet have we
mind you 3 hours battery life 10 hours battery life
this comes down to that dreaded pathetic ending again
where if you've watched this video and thought man
I mean you know do important work on the train
so that's been very very good for me
the shops out of stock coming up one of eBay
I imagine this is his desk with his PC
you know and his keyboard and all that stuff going on here
he's got it set up to the left of his desk on a music
we're going to mention the other programmer uses for video chat
oh well it's like Skype but isn't if somebody comes through on this
he just sort of presses the answer button and a way
a bit like a screwdriver with a spikey handle you
this is the new one zero six zero plus graphics tablet
I have actually reviewed the earlier model that I bought from a friend
let's open this up and see what's inside
let's turn it over and see what we have
they're supposed to be an 8 gig memory somewhere
Drive I'm going to find it out later anyway
Koosh in just behind a front cover to protect tablet
put this back here and this to you back here
nibs as well and this is their this is the nib remover
this piece of metal here so I shall put this here like this
the new design of the cable is much better
I'm going to demonstrate the performance on some selected software
PC but I am NOT very sure what it's supposed to do
then there's the screen setting let's see what is this
where opens up and external dialog box where you can test your pen pressure
the dialog box comes up so I can do this all right
they do not paper as well compared to
Nezumi Pro if you want to have even smoother strokes smoother papers for example
this is the only issue that I face with Photoshop
I do not know why now when it comes to latency lag
let me change the settings first so right here
this seems like mischief has no problems at all
he can detect pen pressure as well and the strokes they are very smooth
MUX the strokes they taper very well in is cheap too
close this and move on to MIDI Bank paint Pro MIDI Bank paint
which has a lot of features dedicated to drawing manga
how do you recommend this this is mischeif
I mean sorry this is mini Bank paint crew again
this is version 3.0 point one point one so let me see
this is actually an app developed for tablets so you can support
we don't have this as well and it works quite well you can
if you happen to be using sketchbook well
too so with sketchbook again and pressure works very well
I think there are some problem with the tapering effect again
I think they have a very good product here
it's a really good plugin with all the other software
Sometimes it's a gamble when it comes to budget technology.
But today I'm going to take a detailed look at the DragonTouch Max
which is expandable and a 10.1 inch IPS
It runs on Android 9 Pie which is still running on a lot
The touch screen is pretty smooth and responsive.
there's a front mounted camera which is great for video chat.
there's also another camera with a flash next to it.
And in case you're curious, here are the highest resolutions
And on the bottom of the tablet there are dual stereo speakers.
Buttons are pretty minimal on the Max 10 and as you can see
Next to those is the memory card slot.
And even though you can see there are 2 indicators for dual SIM cards
And that's mainly because the headphone cord works as the antenna for the radio.
You can also use offline maps thanks to the built-in GPS.
But there are a few of things you'll need first.
One is the free Open Camera app from the Play Store.
Next you'll need a TRRS adapter like this one from StarTech.
To get the mic set up, touch and hold the Open Camera icon.
Now go into the Video Settings and tap on Audio Source.
10 is a great value for all the features it comes with.
today i received a graphic double summer company
and let's get into it if you start in the beginning of the video
but don't worry you will be only needing a few of these first
i didn't know how to set it then
after a few minutes it was easy to set it up
you don't need to also use a power adapter only hdmi and usb cable
this may seem very very hard but believe me
inches widescreen full hd screen and have 16.7 million colors
who have long term exposure to digital drawing
the graphic tablet on the left side have 11 shortcut keys
when i started to draw on the screen
which i think is pretty high for a low class
i'm used to draw or paint on paper
sometimes i take stubble into my head and draw like that
stay like two hours or they did shut it down
it depends from your left or how good it is
the only back the top will have that
i don't really mind it because you can just press the back button
i've been using like a two weeks daily now
i would like to talk about the durability
also the depth fell down on the ground like three times
and i'm still surprised you still live and also one time
a lot of the wooden frames on the wall fell down at the tablet
said i was going to review this reversible laptop tablet
it comes with a pen and then we're about to just review it okay
it's nice and compact and secure in there
well what is that little dust a little dust from the bag there
i believe you can put an hdmi in there
uh usbc's over here in the top right corner bang bang and then look
that thing's cool captain spectra nice and clean
that's right so i do all my editing
it's a little harder than i thought it would be
the only thing they really lied about is the battery life
because it's a it's a mean machine man
i feel like this bad dog can handle it like and subscribe
i'll see you next time on rugged rose review thanks for subscribing
it wrapped it in money and then there will be another video after that
Andrew four points to out-of-the-box and yeah the screen resolution is 480 by 800
I mean I don't know if it's just me I was expecting
don't expect too much either because I played subway surfers I played my boy
it's not bad to be honest with the
I really can't say much more about this
hey everyone I wanted to try something a little different with this video
the ultra thin flexible graphic tablet marked at 30 369 USD on Amazon
it's marketed as a stylus pad for the rhythm game
LPI lines per inch and it's basically a measure of the tablets resolution meaning
so you don't get to hear the actual unboxing sounds sorry
so this is the tablet pretty small but perfect for portability
here's the QuickStart guide and the driver CD though
you can download it on their website here
I don't recommend trying to fold it all the way
I am actually drawing as you can see
I'll be using Adobe Flash because that's normally what I hand made on
I can confirm that it actually works pretty well
you could adjust that this is selecting your monitor
it's like the one that you're working on and pressure test
you'll notice that it's kind of more rectangular in here
I'll draw another one probably a little bigger
this would be your whole tablet and by matching the screen ratio
it'll actually look more like a square here
so things aren't weird because it before doing that
I'd like to do to test tablets is I guess
which is why we have the convenient smooth tool
I'd say this tablet is pretty good for sketching on programs
but if you are gonna do more detailed art
I do a lot of undos if my undo rates have increased drastically
I've got to draw the rest of my hair
um this kind of tablet but it works you know
thank you matrix bad as 8 which is really a fantastic tablet running
Android OS with eight inch IPS screen now
all the typical feature would let you decide that
I tend to go extra mile showing each and everything to a typical user
we're gonna go with the unboxing to see what comes with this matrix pad
IPS technology screen with 1280 by 800 screen resolution
only a typical tablet that can meet the basic video and Internet needs
SIM card option as well as the earphone out
rocker switch power on and off button and a microphone slot
you can't really fault much around it everything every
Buzzle is fantastically done like a premium in quality
I have to admit that screen is fantastic
Android 9.0 with the RAM of 2 gigabytes
actually that's quite a lot to be honest with you
obviously the new systems are taking little bit long
life tablet is installed with the 2,400 million pair
you got to get the better response out of your battery life now
you can see that works great on the touch screen as well
now another typical use of this kind of a tablet is the web surfing
you can use your Google Chrome or any web browser you have in here
just keep adding the tab in there so
it's not a edited version or anything like that
I only notice by using this application called FM radio
we have all the typical applications which are pre-installed
your cameras are also available in a year front as well as the back
here is your front camera on it now
click on to this menu button and press this here
well you can see me right in there
the response of a screen is pretty decent
oh now there's another important test which we should not forget to try
it's basically a shifting between landscape and portrait
yo not bad actually not that bad and you work great now
actually it worked great on it non-medication on my plex server work
I can play any video from a black server right on this tablet
look at that no problem in terms of the navigation as well now
I liked the most about this tablet as well now
I have shown you everything which I think very important to make a call
I suppose I have cleared everything if you think I have missed anything
please do let me know in the comment section down below as well
that is that tablet worth buying or not
Android operating system is using the latest one
can it play the games yes it can
yes it can can you use it on the
what else you want navigation works very good off your web serving
this tablet is worth buying from my side
that would be all from my side guys
Brad Linder with little beauty and this is the cube
and you can switch between operating systems just by hitting that little
OS switch button which I will show you in a few minutes first
let's take a quick look at what you can do in
it's probably some sort of anti-glare coating although as you can see
so let's go ahead and reboot now the first month or so that
I had this tablet I found myself not really using it much in Windows
I don't happen to have a bluetooth mouse but I do
we can treat it like a general desktop or laptop style computer
now we have access to running it in a small moveable window
but this is where we're shooting the video
it's going to open up the video here
we go exhibit viewing angles are pretty good
we can brighten the screen a little bit viewing angles are pretty good
so it should look good from different angles
it actually finishes it more quickly than any other
I'm going to open that same image in the blog post
oh this is a really high-resolution screen windows tells me
but these little file save you know delete etc
same thing happens with the image editing program
I had two applications running side by side
there is the option to do that in
menus are really really tiny which can be difficult to use
unless you're holding the tablet right here or up to your nose
but it make it kind of difficult to see what's happening
so that's a quick look at and sort of what you can do
you have to do the same thing you have to wait again
is that when you reboot it messes with the clock for some reason
it's 2 o'clock or a 2 20 but it thinks that it's it's 720
it'll be off by about 4 hour or five hours again
I'm not really sure why it does that but it does that
3G is an interesting option and I forgot to mention this earlier
it's about 6 to 7 hours of battery life
q qs' software here which there's a configuration utility in
there's a little button on the bottom says dual OS switcher
there's no way to go back once you hit it so
you're about to be signed out closed and it's rebooting you
Wow pretty impressed with the design so far
so you guys can have a quick read
you also have four gigs of RAM 64 gigs of internal storage
Wi-Fi AC Bluetooth version for GPS and Android version 7.1
the build quality feels very solid great design
so it's quite useful that this tablet has dual band
max has taken position 5 on this chart
that's all for this video don't forget to
hello guys welcome to a new video today
I'm gonna be doing a review of the Galman s 56k drawing tablet
Wacom pens you will need to put a battery in it
it has a button at the end where you turn it on and off
Sai the lines were much smoother and the pressure sensitivity
I have the smallest desk I could find in Ikea
I've included footage from the screen recording and from my webcam
I work with this tablet if it helps you at all
the working area is 120 by 160 millimeters
I said I prefer the feeling of using a standard tablet that isn't flexible
I just used the shortcuts on my laptop
D&D characters I'm gonna be playing her in a one-shot next months
she goes by brandy and she's half elf half hill dwarf
she's short and has a little bit of a 5 o'clock shadow on occasions
she doesn't really know what she's got herself in for
so that's gonna be fun so yeah overall
this one had no issues with the active area
I only had the occasional problem with pressure sensitivity which was quickly resolved

this is what acetone does with a tablet pen
yeah the instructions there are million which is even pollution
that's good for me because as you can see
I mean as you can hear my English is crap
I could use it anyway but that was better overall
the tablet is really good and I highly recommend it
I tested it and about that speed point
I know a lot about them you might think
I thought I think because I I don't like lying I need
yeah sorry for my voice it hurts a little bit but yeah

was that happen in like the first week as you can see
I just use just a piece of blossom kind of plastic here
I haven't even bought a purple screen protector and it still works
fine as you can see the things that shine and now you mind
prefer the feel of it but it doesn't really bother me that much
some of these do require batteries but the version
I don't like is the two bottoms right here
this is usually my enter button and this could be my eraser button
I really would prefer if there was just no buttons at all
how old just traditional pencils feel to be honest
uh there's not in there and here's the nib remover
which pretty much if you want to take the nib out
it's very easy and you just return that so the nibs will last
but that's just really up to whatever you do so a lot of people
I'm not pressing as you can see right now
I actually see a lot and a lot of people
just keep asking that in different tablet review comments and stuff like that
I have here and I made a mistake
I'm actually not sure what this is for side
I just don't use a my tablet works fine without that
that's the top button and you can just go into mouse commands
you want and you can just drag like that so you want to
the only section left is supports digital ink
it works if you click supports digital ink
it does not work if you don't have a clicked on for me anyways

I recently bought off at Amazon for $80
you have the stylus itself with two programmable buttons
install help drivers software essentials that come with the
you could really draw easier than using a mouse and keyboard with this tablet
are this graphics tablet very useful in drawing like
click is pan and zoom if you're wondering where
I give this tablet a perfect 10 out of 10 no cons no nothing
All opinions in this video are my own.
I was making, but I wouldn't say it held me back.
The Cintiq 16 features an anti-glare screen with a natural paper-like feel.
Color accuracy is important for professionals and artists who print their work.
The Cintiq Pros reach nearly 100% of Adobe RGB.
The Cintiq 16 screen and body are built of durable, scratch-resistant materials.
The build quality feels very solid and doesn't feel flimsy or cheap.
Power LED Brightness, if you want to dim it or turn it off altogether.
The legs have rubber feet that grip your desk.
If you prefer more options for positions, you can purchase an optional stand.
It makes the display much more stable and easy to position.
The only trouble I had was attaching it upside down on the first try.
This is especially useful when you are moving the tablet around on your desk.
they should expect from a budget display tablet.
everyone is going to appreciate the higher level of quality
Wacom offers, but allow me to share a few of the ways
Screen glare can make it very difficult to work on a display tablet.
The feel of the screen is also very important.
The Cintiq 16 has a paper-like feel which adds some friction while drawing.
It's the same pen that's included with the top of the line Cintiq Pros.
The Pro Pen 2 is also cordless, battery-free, and does not require charging.
Don't overlook pen quality when you buy a tablet
Let's not forget that the Pro Pen 2 also supports pen tilt.
Pen tilt is only supported by a few Cintiq alternatives.
Build quality is one of those things that you have to feel.
It's hard to show in a photo or a video.
The Cintiq 16 and its stand feel durable.
The drawing experience on the Cintiq 16 felt top-notch.
The pen didn't make any accidental marks or wobbly lines.
pressure are smooth and easily calibrated for a lighter or heavier touch.
There wasn't any unusual parallax, even near the edges of the screen.
I got exactly the experience I expected from a display tablet.
The Cintiq 16's screen offers a smaller color gamut of only 72% NTSC.
The Cintiq 16 screen has a lower resolution than the Cintiq Pro 16.
The Cintiq Pro 13 is also 1920x1080 HD.
The Pro models offer USB-C and DisplayPort, in addition to HDMI.
The Cintiq Pro 13 is about $150 more than the Cintiq 16.
Honestly, the Cintiq 16 covers the essentials pretty well.
The Cintiq 16 is well-built with durable parts.
As I've said earlier, it doesn't feel cheap.
The anti-glare coating and parallax reduction worked really well.
The Pro Pen 2 is top-of-the-line and supports pen tilt.
The Cintiq 16 includes a handy three-in-one cable which I find convenient.
That way, you don't miss my new reviews.
The Cintiq Pro 16 is a fantastic budget
display tablet that provides the essential features an artist needs.
If this were my first display tablet, I'd be so stoked.
If you're looking for an excellent, entry-level display tablet, the Cintiq 16 is it.

Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.
I'm really excited to show you this new product today
it houses a big battery that doubles effectively
the runtime of the tablet nice keyboard supports along the sides
but apart from that you really don't need it to run the device
now what that effectively means of course is when
so there's always been improvements in battery life
so you've easily got all-day battery life on this device in fact
there is a very small slot inside the tablet itself
it's a Wacom pen that will work on these devices in Australia
what's up y'all time for another tablet review with more touhou art
i don't understand what the thing is with me doing
touhou art specifically of characters in suits and tablet reviews
yomu in a suit is just something that works
aside from sending me the review copy of the tablet
it is 22 inches about as big as my secondary monitor
that's great for transport the sticker on the pen however is very sticky
the tablet is very bright and has a very rich color space
each model i received from xp pen has been very accurate color
i reviewed and the one i was using up before this point
coming from an innovator 16 it's virtually no different
it comes with two cables to attach to the pc
it can support both a standard usb and a usb-c connection now
adapter your hdmi cable and your usb connector
for some reason the cables themselves are actually a little on the short side
it also comes with a cleaning cloth and a glove also one little aside
the innovator 16 actually have this issue to solve this one
you have to unplug it and then plug it back
in the artist 22 fortunately fully shuts off the screen
but they'll operate like a non-screen tablet until you plug it in
there's a new monitor but the drivers won't until after you restart the drivers
this might be something that can be solved in a driver
it's a pretty simple work around beyond that
the drivers are as no frills as the tablet itself
xp pens routinely made great tablets and the artist
they're not paying me to say any of this
and this is my honest opinion of this tablet
everybody kind of goes through cycles with their art anyway
i still have yet to play any touhou game
hey yeah it's me shadow or chad or whatever floats your boat
i received an email from gaomon asking me to review their tablet
more information is in the description and later in the video now
we've got the tablet itself we have a
you know what else fits like a glove
there are some manuals that has an untrained professional
nibs and a pen holder mystery over some adapters
we need to find the tablet to download the wait
this tablet is much bigger than the pen tablet
i started out on and that was super duper
i use them avidly while making this speed paint
actually the fact that they included a glove in here was awesome as well
i actually still have it on right now at the time of recording this
i didn't have one of these when i started out
and that's not that big of a problem all in all
i didn't find any glaring issues with this tablet
it was very inexpensive for its quality and that was fantastic
this was a very great tablet to work with
they're having a lightning sale on some of their tablets
so go ahead and check the description for those thanks
hey guys this is big a 50 tablet and in this video
I am going to review it and tell you if it's worth buying
I have already done unboxing and first impressions video about this
double that using two fingers to fit on the screen
this tablet is not compatible with mobile devices
Mac operating system as well as Windows now in order to connect the tablet
the default one is for brush and eraser swap
I wish the button was slightly texturized or maybe slightly more prominent
I highly recommend you buy this one and just look at the price
now remember this has a unique gesture pad again
which makes it a very unique tablet so the link is in the description
I've been very own that's the HTC high-capacity cards are accepted speaker
put a w flash on there you discover all kind of sluggish
this guy zipped it right along nice improvement
only one gig is available for your use everything else is serve for
Android tablet would say like the HTC Flyer that sells for $2.99
of course if you're rooted you can do all sorts of things to it
the fire is not bad you can see
it's pretty much the same stuff that we've seen before once again
they did a really good job with with periodicals
this is a little small on the seven-inch screen phantes ennoble says
something that amazon can't offer but and then again
we're looking at our application library of shortcuts to books magazines newspapers
no kids stuff which is really pretty cold and my stuff which is documents
you just have it and there any of you download in terms of books
we've got pretty much again the same thing as with enough coloring here
I've made a bookmark on like any touch screen reader or LCD
up with the quarters gonna set you up a bookmark
it's not an eating device it is an IPS
LCD display tap near the top and it brings up options here
it's able to match up the book since
it's nice it's a little compact wind out here
now when you're reading epub books you're the ones that you've got from
this is what I've got pre-installed right now
you've got an email application where Capri and IMAP email
these were both pre-installed out of the box in fact there's Netflix
integration right into the settings you can set your account information right there
Netflix works great on this by the way
so really there's so far doing them the best from anybody
anything that you've used for lend me and archived items so my files
I've put some PDFs so you can see what that's like first
we have a user manual for an upper computer here and again
Illustrated PDF there is no changing point size or anything like that
so you're always going to have a real true
we have an application called my media and that's for playing
look at your photos as a bunch of sample photos
hit stop and then come back to it alright
I know I'm you're probably excited by that
and by the way this does do Hulu
Netflix right now so we are playing Netflix
what this tablet does mean it access anywhere
Netflix is a bingo this is what your Netflix interface
and we've got a music player onboard plus a 3.5 millimeter
jack so gives me the options of using my two music apps here
and there was a embedded video on the front page

it comes with a nice little foam pad in here
he's in like bleh download kind of cover

it has many apps already pre-installed like Microsoft solitaire
obviously it has internet microsoft edge for windows 8 and up now
I'll show you how good it is actually
I'll show you like how it looks from cameras angle
aren't that great as you can see so
I mean I've charges for about 20 minutes already
and so yeah so this thing is a really good tablet
I hope you liked this review over here yay
I thought does a Saturday when I do this
all right and what do you think what do you like about it
you look like you're having fun all right
so today we're gonna talk about the fire
it's the new tablet for a 2 year old
and it's got a pretty nice foam case on it
it's lightweight she can hold it with her two hands
there's multiple games on here and there's one that she plays
you just set it up with a password and they can't get into it
it has cameras on both sides of the tablet
leave comments if you have any questions thanks
CD and the user manual along with two pens
GT 191 tablets itself along with the stand
there's a screen protector that comes attached to the screen
I had everything up and running and I was ready to start working
you're able to adjust the screen to any angle
everything was fixed and it was working fine after that
I usually love to have a few buttons that I can change the presets
I've had so much fun making this video
I can't wait to attempt some large landscape paintings
total of forty seven dollars and some odd cents and that does include shipping
alright take it out of the box as you can see
I like to do so I can draw something on paper
the driver software it also comes with a software suite
I don't know if it says on the back yes
it does annotation forward pin command or pin signature pin male pin notice
I had nice eyes though feel sky between the plastic
oh and comes with a little stand to keep your pin in okay
I'm having to work around it so as you can see nice large tablet
the pin seems a little on the cheap side as far as build quality
click for me now as you can notice
because you see this tablet down here okay
I've crossed over to this other one by mistake
now some programs will override that for example now
goes back once you click on the desktop
oh you want to click on that right there
no well just delete that later and but like
I said it also disables your second screen temporarily while that program is running
it'll go back to letting you use two screens
it's supposed to let you sign your emails and your
that's but that is all that will run on
Windows 7 or at least all that mine runs on Windows 7
those are pretty many programs but now let's try drawing
something is a free open source image editing program and it's really good
let's see if it'll do it again yeah
I chose cloned the screen show only on one there
if you find that to be easier you can you can do that
unfortunately it was a serial it was in a USB
I mean I don't even know of a new computer you can buy
you'd have to build it yourself by buying a motherboard
that actually has a serial port still on it so
total the actual unit the actual using area is even smaller than that
let's say you don't want to use this whole big or huge working area
like if you had a program they had like a thicker border
it doesn't bend or anything that I can tell and it works
I have about this the and the pin base
but it's really not that big of an issue especially considering that a
Wacom is sixty to seventy dollars and this is just not as well
just say fifty bucks to make things simple and it's much much bigger
hello internet world and welcome to my review of the vast king kingpad sa10
10 tablet very kindly sent in free of charge by the manufacturer
and you can see a very wide screen
it's an ultra wide screen 10 inches 1080p display
there's a little bit of lag as you saw there
also we do get a calculator calendar and of course
the camera app built in and google chrome for browsing the internet
i think this is a really good offering
technology used the viewing angles are very good as well
today I have the m0 610 Pro from artis all a pen
tablet that has customized LEDs to inspire that artist within all of us
we're gonna go over that in a minute now
you place on your desk connected to your computer you draw on the pent
I'm John and what I'm not out saving the universe
I do tutorials and reviews on hardware and software
nowadays is a nice felt velcro pen case holder
you can store your pen and all your nibs in here next
there were two bag of nibs and a nib remover
there's your nice piece of kit right there
that's basically how fast the mouse talks to the actual tablet itself
one key is available to cycle through those modes
finally there's a customizable quick dial and we'll cover that in a second
DM 0 610 Pro comes with the P 58 B digital pen
this is one of the more unique pens
it's more like a clicky kind of gift
especially with a lot of the gamer guys
here you're trying to sync this thing up to my different
okay going through the driver so real quick
this is the dashboard links to the website
this is where we set up our buttons test pressure
settings is where you gonna go to configure your different profiles per application now
the drive will to cycle through them if you open the program
add it into the driver the Android functionality works as it should
you'll use one of the included micro USB or USB c2 USB a converters
you just open up your art app of choice
I chose SketchBook Pro and you could see it just works
we're just starting to get some line quality tests and what
is show that light medium to hard brush
the artisinal tablet does deliver those three different levels of gradient that
I really want to make sure there's no pen lag
I'm not noticing any lag in the lines and since it's a pen tablet
I'm able to drop back to a nice light stroke
no tests are nice but you want to see
both of my pencil work and also some shading exercises that
now one thing I do have to mention
I was experiencing but wasn't yet ready for primetime case
anybody hasn't heard there's this little issue of a pandemic going on so
I liked the company and I like the slogan now
Xperia z2 tablet the successor to Sony's Xperia Z tablet last year
Oh point 25 inches and how minimalistic it really is here on the back
you're going to find the 8.1 megapixel camera
it does do okay with the pictures and the video most tablets
pretty much lag free has a nice 6,000 milliamp battery which lasts very long
leave those down below in the comments section
hey guys the CTA Prime back here again
I'm just gonna be referring to it as the m16
there's definitely a little photoshopping going on with those promotional pictures
even looking at a head-on so a specs go for the CPU
so you can pick up that 5 gigahertz
8 megapixel rear camera 2.1 megapixel front and is running
it's got that AC Wi-Fi built-in and I did run a test
we'll go full screen with it and make sure we're at 1080p here
it's telling me that it's running at 53
over on the fire 10 single core 1402 multi-core 5000 203
we're running when it comes to these easier to run touch base mobile games
we get a bit of lag now personally
I've seen a lot worse on lower in tablets
I'm having here is the touch screen itself
it's not as smooth as I was hoping it would be keep in mind
consecutively so this thing is getting a bit hot on the back with that
I also wanted to give a little emulation in here
the internal resolution is set at 640 by 480
I can do to make this game run any better so in the end
it's really hard for me to recommend this m16 tablet for pretty much
but if you're buying a $200 Android tablet
I know because my galaxy s2 charger is right there and it works
Scott are you you know points and stuff which I could just show you
so here's your slots as you charge your port
and that's just a speaker on this side
got power there volumes plus and minus there
that takes a rather long time to boot
your added donations now your unlock button there
I already told you that I'll show you the camera or quit
of course it doesn't show as good as it really is
hey guy that's about as good as it is on the camera
oh yeah okay as that runs on minecraft
damn so everything rolling here nice and smooth
remember how long it took for me to load minecraft
now that's a big plus come standard with iHeartRadio as well
seems my tablet had a little slope a check but click on their search
still pretty fast enjoyable and bring up my pages flick off these guys
I was doing the radio show this weekend
but this is it this is it you get a Windows
let me tell you a little bit about it
I don't care enter my pin so we can log in and see it
not the fastest processor it's a system-on-a-chip the Intel Bay Trail processor
I was thinking so he came with that
OneNote this is that this is not some cheap Microsoft Office
Microsoft Office in a 7 inch tablet quad-core processor
it isn't the super fastest process in the world
you tried it the classic environment you know mean the desktop or the desktop
it's I mean here's the issue with this
which on a seven-inch screen well you know
USB port on the side right there is
that's really an you can connect a keyboard and mouse to that or like
Logitech receiver and you can dock this to HDMI to a large screen
here's our chat room running in the background all the time
yeah and you could plug in a now
see how hard even at 1280 by 800
how hard is it those little things there to make that go fullscreen
I'm gonna put it up to the microphone so you can hear
it's got dual speakers coming out of the bottom such a good song
but you're not exactly getting the full bass and look at this
I think that'd be the smart way to go
you don't feel like this is slow do you
I mean it feels like that is the first time
I've launched this cooking app so that's a little
this is gonna look at this watt corner this is scrolling
B G and N it's an IPS screen
but you can see it's not a bad looking screen even at an angle
I feel like it's a king cake for Mardi Gras
I've got as you can see a bunch of apps going
I don't feel like it's that slow no
we're not clear on why it's so cheap
I have unlimited onedrive storage because I have an office 365 subscription
that's one thing to note if you already have an office
sign into your account your windows account as I did on this tablet
you won't be able to take advantage of the free version of Office
you have to use your own existing version of
this would be great for a kid or a student also a full size
USB means you can use a keyboard and mouse with it that's great
I should hook it up but I didn't think of that
it is a very surprisingly good for the price
and it's certainly adequate for some you know lightweight computing
you probably want stick with the modern apps
I mean an Excel spreadsheet at 1280 by 800 on a 7-inch
I could do that these icons No so you just have to
I didn't mention battery life that's another Pro
believe it or not about five hours battery life for charge
yeah that's not iPad level but it's good enough $59.99 plus shipping
it comes out under $70 for the win-win book tw7 hundred tablet definitely
there's a regular USB on that's I think around the table
it's not a really expensive mean by five
this is very much like an iPad keyboard
it's thumb typable which is actually makes it particularly useful so
I'm gonna say that to the chat room
it's got predictive type and there goes boom
Wow Wow a full-size PC is seven-inch box
today I will be reviewing the lincei 7-inch Android tablet I found
the seven-inch screen resolution is actually decent other than the charging port
the only other device port is the auxiliary jack for the headphones
I did also notice with the volume all the way up
this tablet will actually still serve its purpose for the specific reason
I bought it which was strictly playing videos for my kids while it drives
I use poor man's ingenuity and just kept
use up too much memory for this tablet
thanks again for watching and as always until next time

while this day i might give you a tour of my studio for now
thank you very much since lab and um wow
it's surprisingly way better than i thought it would be
and if you prefer the smaller grips um then this would be pretty awesome
and i like the bigger grips and it's it's it looks pretty awesome
the box that kept the pen came pretty nice which is uh unbeatable
and the way you you work on your line feels very very good
but um you might have to put a little more pressure than usual
uh like how the pen or the pencil
i think you you are able to do it
and all the packaging and the tablet itself everything looks pretty solid
they just send me the product so i can try
i think this might be their first generation
i'm not sure but i haven't seen anything like it
he's doing some quick environment painting so you can kind of observe it
uh the light and dark and all the opacity all the pressure sensitivity
i got kind of like taken away i was like
this thing is better than i thought because usually you see
uh some of the tablet comments came out in the market
and you're like ah they're not as you know as good as welcome
it'll look like the cell phone in landscape version
why you buy this is for your eyes because it really looking at it
it will tell you if it's too close to your face
which is why you're buying this in the first place
you turn it for example if i tilt it down
you're starting to see more oranges and that is true
it's almost like a chameleon screen and because there is no color whatsoever
that has been etched into a piece of metal because it's not quite yellow
if you're just joining us this is our lcd
you have absolutely no issues watching videos whatsoever
that is not why you're buying this device
basically an e-ink device that can't stand the lack of refresh
meaning you have that much more screen real estate than say your cell phone
you're carrying around in your pocket and this does have lcd
of course all of this will come down to the individual application
if you're holding it like that how much can fit on the screen etc
this is exactly what people were waiting for an e-ink type screen
that isn't e-ink it's lcd but it's not really lcd
meaning you get the best of all worlds
this thing is going to last a long time
i hope you're all doing well so last video
we're gonna break it down to actually beginning the actual drawing for the pages
i can open up and see what i need to do now
many comic artists like to write a full script and write out
try not to spend more than like 30 seconds on each one
then take a break come back to it later
a good thing to do is sketch up
but i'm aware it can get overwhelming and boring
one of the biggest things to work on is style consistency
hence why sketching up the pages in big batches can help
each page takes around three to four hours to finish sometimes longer
depending on how many panels there are and the detail
also keep in mind that readers will only spend about 30 seconds
max on each page while you will spend hours making it
i would also highly recommend planning panels around your speech bubbles
if you're using clip studio paint like i am
i've considered going back and fixing some of the older pages
speaking of speech bubbles another thing to keep in mind while working on pages
is that while you as an artist may be zoomed in
the speech bubbles big look at how other comic artists online do
a comic and the speech bubbles are completely illegible
it is the m0610 pro graphics tablet it is 10 by 6 inches
the tablet comes with eight express keys and a little style
which honestly is just the cutest little thing
i think it's i think it's really cute
i think that this tablet is honestly fantastic for you guys
that are new to art and i have a ton of young beginner artists
it's beautiful it's stunning and i highly recommend it the company that sent me
i'm extremely grateful for this company for being so wonderfully patient with me
they might be working on that but it does work on
mac os systems as well as windows systems
but i don't know but that's fine by me because i use just computers
thank you so much to artificial for sending me this absolutely stunning tablet again
hey hey it's time to thank my patreons
you guys have been so patient with me
what is this a hundred dollar tier the galaxy
it was a wild month for me so again
2 gigs of ram 16 gigs of ROM
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth there's also an expandable SD slot up to 64 gigs now
so these are pretty much the cheapest tablet you can get
let's take a look unbox it and see what you get
there's absolutely nothing on the outside of the box to identify it
it's totally plain so super generic a lot of different configurations of this tablet
let's find out what's inside inside the box
the tablet wrapped up in a lot of plastic
I guess a European adapter which is no good for me in North America
my tablet actually arrived cracked in the bottom
right hand corner it was actually kind of cracked open
I was able to just kind of snap it back into place
there's dual speakers which are okay not very loud
Play Store and your email on all that
I'm actually using a Bluetooth controller here because I've got it set up
go to about tablet and here we can find all these specific information now
the tablet model number is actually called a V 11
firmware 3.4 kernel and the ROM build is called a star
so it's great to have it actually come with it now
that's a very low-end tablet but it has decent performance for basic productivity
this tablet has a terrible painful to look at screen
YouTube videos with friends or try to show people things on this tablet
it really ruins the experience with the washed out kind of blurry picture
quality is definitely the biggest downside to the tablet
ate your brains too now to go over the final stats of the device
you'll notice here that the system storage and internal storage are separate locations
so basically you'll have to uninstall some apps
it can be a bit of a problem now
you'll see that these system storage in the internal storage
the tablet comes with the all winner a 33 quad-core processor a 32-bit processor
we're going to look at the battery capacity and health with a handy app
the deep sleep rating is around minus 30
scroll down and look for the security tab
click on the security tab and scroll down till you find unknown sources
the next step we're gonna go to the
I'm going to download it directly to the device now to see notifications
we swipe down from the left hand side
that's where our notification for the download will be coming up
there doesn't take that long and I'll load it up
once the app starts for the first time
it says root access is unavailable currently but there is a root strategy available
King root app page and under root authorization
or in this case we're gonna allow it
we verified our root status is functioning properly
the device is now rooted for any rooted apps
the performance level of this device is best compared to 1st generation tablets
I'd rate this tablet two and a half out of five stars
the user experience was ok that the screen was unacceptable
and you may get stuck with a lesser device than what you paid for
you can put a sticker on your headphones for me
it's always gone because a kid always has my tablet
I don't want my son to access my ten-year-old son
the first thing you're gonna see are these books
these are the 25 pre-loaded Disney books when my kids were learning to read
they loved these books especially in kindergarten grade
one they're amazing books so we went and took a tour of the mall
you can either have the tablet read to you
you can have it autoplay or you can read to yourself
it also comes with different apps that are specifically for kids so
I don't let my ten-year-old watch standard YouTube
I make him watch YouTube for kids when he does access YouTube
I mean I'm not even concerned about dropping it
the only thing I think I would change about
I had a child in kindergarten or a grade one
those are great books that they have in there
there's just no way so having it prepackaged in this shell
you can see my full written review of this cool tablet on
I'm a little upset usually when I'm drawing
it definitely works but it has a lot of problems
the tablet that I'm using is a helium 420
I don't know the actual pronunciation of it
this probably isn't an issue for some people but it definitely was for me
and so my pen is constantly falling apart
you're listening to actually comes through into your headphones
my computer completely restarted it and it was it was gone but then
I used sigh and maybe I worded it wrong
I've gotten a couple of really good drawings out of it
I hope your days have been better than mine
I've got a quick opportunity to show you this
but it looks as you can see very very similar to the Q 702
it's got a very similar sort of looking design about it in the typical
it's got a 1366 by 768 display resolution
we've got a great viewing angle which is really essential for tablets now
which is pretty amazing for a tablet that is very lightweight in fact the
this tablet is clear targeted at business users at corporate
on-site warranty which is quite unique for a tablet device
there's a couple of little lugs there that
there's no as you can see on the back of this
there's no way to actually open this machine up and in fact often times
so if you had a smart card or a single sign-on authentication device
we've got a webcam and on the back
we're also running a 64-bit operating system which is a really brilliant feature
Fujitsu 2 button pen that has a finer tip or another example of that
of course the tablet has the standard Windows 8 handwriting recognition capability
but as you can see it does really well
Q 572 is really designed for corporate tablet deployment
kind of place that you might expect to see
Wacom tablets you can pick these up on Amazon
usually used in rare cases there are new ones
whenever using the pen or touch input however if you leave
let's talk about the software usually when you buy these off of Amazon
you can change how the pen tip feels
you can change tracking modes you can enable click
Express keys and have various purposes like opening the bamboo dock or switching pages
the smooth surface is where you use your pen
it has a 5.8 inch by three point
larger pens and the pen is 6 inches
long it features wireless capability but you will need a battery which
I did not have one with mine in total
make sure to subscribe so you can see the next time
peek it's going to be about this tripod thing
barb um good job stupid walking on our shelf let's see what
okay we have the bamboo create pin and touch tablet
okay so here's the box it comes in and here's what comes in that
here's the drawing pin along with some accessories
and there you have it all out of the box now
I just put those in there a second ago
I'm going to show you how that works right here
and yes you will go to pen tips
you don't need the tool for this part okay
that's the part that you actually draw in
it also has an attached pin holder on the side to put your pin
Wacom site to get that also and as far as pressure goes
sure no pen goes perfect with that texture
so let's have a good texture to it
that's when you get action actual drawing on the screen
I have Photoshop and all that why would I want to buy this product
and that's pretty much how you draw or design things with this
here's here's one thing though but I could've done this with a mouse again
this thing is just a trackpad to count like apples
trackpad is kind of like a touch pad
I mean that's pretty much it only only thing
but that's for interview of the bamboo pin and touch create tablet
thanks for watching starting at the top it says
you can also look at your application list
now that's your back button that is of course
if you will now the one thing you notice
now you can also go in the action
Notification Center to actually switch between tablet mode
I use all the time like you know
Chrome for instance here or I can open up you know
I can now decide how I want to multitask
you were running on there now with this
I can switch between either the two even on a 7-inch tablet again
hey guys welcome back to my channel in this video
I'm going to review the legally pac-10 which is an entry-level Android tablet
the seller also gave a free gift a cheap headphone here
it's probably the best deal around at the moment
so let's take a look at the box of the LeapPad 10
yeah and yeah it does feel pretty well built this
so yeah so yeah a bunch of cheap earphones
I think these are the loudest speakers that I've had on any smart device
you go the more distortion there is so now
so let's see what what scores is getting okay
something some apps in the background it actually actually produces choppy video on YouTube
you know surfing websites and checking their Facebook and yeah
the video quality is what you'd expect from an entry level tablet
it's not as good as the mid-range smartphones that
SIM card slot slots at the back and single single memory card slot
let me show you what it looks like so to open the slot
you just need to pry open this plastic cover here
there are some weaknesses here and there some flaws but overall
that concludes my review of the illegally pad 10
I hope you found is really useful and please hit the like button
all the opinions you're about to hear are my own
what you're about to see before it was uploaded
we're going to start with what these two tablets have in common
they also both have the same exact processor an MT 8 1 6 8
that's a 64-bit processor to get a little techie
or whatever you're gonna be fine with the lower-priced 2 gig model
I'm finding it's hard sometimes to get the center
you'll hear it out of both audio quality isn't spectacular
but it's better than you might think on a low cost tablet
I tend to do my web conferences with my devices in portrait orientation
the device will of course work in either orientation but just note
and you've got a headphone jack and again
then you've got another camera here on the back
both cameras are 2 megapixels not spectacular image quality
Awards with it and finally the SD card slot here is on the side
they have it protected underneath this little door here
we might see a different ad popping up here
we'll step through a few different things that I tested with these
they're 10 inch tablet is still the best performing
Amazon tablet that they have in their lineup
this is the mobile version of Minecraft running on the low-end HD 8 device
here as you can see it seems to be performing quite nicely
let's go to the main menu and load up maybe
perhaps let's get into it here on the HD 8 at the bottom
we might see that load screen pop up briefly
it didn't bring us back to the main menu
I've got to start over again with my game because there wasn't enough
RAM to keep both apps running in the background
and that's the big difference having three gigs versus two gigs
real quick performance is not spectacular but it is good enough
I think for getting basic web browsing done it does support
read text on here and as you can see
Lindsay's office our webinars that he runs in zoom
I think for media and web browsing for what it is
either because again it doesn't have those official
there are ways to get the official google apps on your Amazon tablet
we're going to explore that in an upcoming video
this was a feature that was in the prior
I'm getting a visual representation of that response
this works though with our other charger here
we're going to put it back down on the charging pad here again
they both will perform about the same as you saw but again
this channel was brought to you by the lon
Tom Albrecht Rick vestido Chris Allegretto in Cali an Kumar
I ma'am I don't think I can do this
hmm how the do people do this seriously
please give me the skill required for this game
I am sure you guys are sick of it but it looks pretty nice
ok this is going to take a while
okay hmm we'll just look inside on the minim oh so
thank you guys for watching and see you next time
this spam looks very similar the established one and liking across the same stuff
this thing is kind of like bubbly and can you exact on it
some of us are drag players like myself
well you know what you can you can drag with it
it acts almost the same as any other tablet
I think this tablet is made for you
I mean its budget its $40 links in the description
so it's pretty good until about a tablet
I haven't tested it out but I should
because because the resolution is is much like the playfield
your mother's piece of goddamnit piece of burn you burn
you can probably not read because my camera isn't that were all now
you can eat it as we have some pen nibs
if you are drag player like me new clip he'll need grip well
nowadays you just download it from the internet from YouTube
mmm what a good and let's try this out so
that can be nobody there is no point
I can use it to hang myself oh I can't even kill myself
I'll pay all these things with the table
this tablet is the key to being a pro
what you cannot have it with this tablet
I am hmm no other tablets can do this well in conclusion
I think this this would be a pretty good choice for them
I think I'm going to give this tablet 715 PP out of time
so thank you for watching and hope you liked it and yes
hello guys and welcome back to my channel
today's video is something super super excited today
can you believe it so human kindly kindly if did me this come this
I am so freaking excited to try this out
I isn't a super old Wacom Intuos and it doesn't have a screen
this also wants for 300 so it's considerably considerably cheaper
this looks very nice so this is what it looks like so far
it's a very nice quality so hot how do I open this
basically but because I have an a Mac I need a lightning cable
because max like to be funny and have all their products in one so
hitch here on cable and I just ordered this of Amazon
I'd ordered the lightning bolt one instead of the thunderbolt connection
the screen is on so we can finally get in today's review video
let's see if it works shall we so
I've kept it set up to the 27 inch display
I couldn't do really nice smooth lines and I've noticed already
I'm just going to increase the pen size
I really like that so far the pressure sensitivity
it doesn't give me a brightness option so I think this is the brightness
see how you get with it and obviously
I'm guessing it I'm gonna put B and see if that works
I can just click this for my pen
I can click this button and it'll open my brush
I have set it off which is obviously undo
I put the wrong come under my dad
so it's clear string again no it's optional and Jose okay apply
I can literally just work like this one day
E and you can put the Kommandant or whatever you use
I'll have set up as your Sharp keys for Photoshop
which is really really good but these are the ones that
I'm going to sketch something okay so I finished doing that
little doodle giving human tablet a little tryout and and
Photoshop has a lot of tools and accessories around
then it might be the tablet for you
obviously it's not gonna be as good as my 4k 27-inch
I'm not clued off of our stuff like that
why am i doing a review video then
and it's nice that the buttons are here
it's very handy for just clicking backwards and forwards and setting up your pen
I liked that I have no complaints about it
it is slightly lukewarm at the top of my tablet and
I can't say how hot it's gonna get Booker
yeah it's very nice quality and it looks cute
there's another 100 on top of your already expensive purchase
so if you're not sure what to get
I mean on a budget that might be something to consider is
Photoshop but you have to plug it into your computer
then the human might be for you if you find of having
obviously this human is not portable in terms of
the human stats for a 300 to 400 pound so not too bad
I'm not used to doing a review video so bear with me
it's very nice so I will actually continue using this graphics tablet
I hope this was helpful to you all
hello infrared camera as part of the webcam here
and that's uh that's actually working uh has been working quite well
hello camera the other thing that i just wanted to mention
is that um all of the usbc points
so if i had to describe this tablet in a few words
the company are really not messing about when it comes to the tablet itself
it has a fantastic performance in terms of the pen to surface movement
it has a usb a to a micro usb to charge the tablet
i'd prefer it to be a usbc but we can't please everybody
there's hundreds of templates on there for you to use
take care and i'll see in the next one
we have a product to review a sim bans
some of you just want in the bottom line
it'll jump you right to the conclusion otherwise stick around
I take a look at it and do a video
you will need to use batteries with the pun
well it really makes a stand out from the crowd especially at its price
point is that it has pressure sensitivity on its screen not touch sensitivity
and that's what you're getting from this also tab as well now
I took some pictures with it and it is not great quality
the resolution wasn't as high as you want
if you do that then the line goes where you would expect now
ideally it would work exactly the same in any orientation that's the way my
it's a little too much up up right
so it's not a big loss there anyway
aside from that the computational power does have its limits again proper expectations
it doesn't have as much power as say the iPad pro
so are you gonna use this for your final professional images
the cameras got a cutout for that as well
the little elastic band is excellent for keeping your pin in there so
another episode of low cost graphic tablet review unbox first experience
what do i think about this last time
let's wrap things up with our very own producer
so they wanted to break into that market with this guy
cuz we have more r a minute or exactly
yeah so it has some a few better interiors
I think that's partly Android a lot of Android devices are like that huh
it also has a 1 gig of ram 16 gigs internal memory
it also has 32 gigs at external microSD card slot on the side
so you can't increase that memory size of 16 gigs isn't enough and then
I of course has the volume ports on the side
I often do that if I listen for a long time yeah
so didn't become a problem for me now
it only lasts about six to eight hours of battery life
BGN Wi-Fi now one thing that I did want to focus on is they
they have adobe audio and two different speakers on here
I'm good so if I pull up my browser it's awfully two different videos
just a couple of short seconds on here
it's nice and clear it gets loud too
i can't tell it home but it sounds pretty good
it would be fine for watching youtube videos
I hate it when ads karaokeing oh I am totally careful
I'll play some music that we won't get taken
yeah and that's a big drawback of this while it does get loud
even though this is brand new this just came out a couple weeks ago
version of jelly before 22 is pretty common
yeah yeah 4.2 is really nice but 4.1
I did want to mention on the front facing camera
I'll pull up some pictures that I took
I took earlier today and some I took a five megapixels eight
Oh greenie it's very hard to get any photos and low point for skyping
Oh deke also no physical buttons on there for a home button
it's all know so when it freezes now again okay
I don't think you need to go much further
yeah and on this 7-inch device on in this day and age
I would expect a much better resolution because the pixel does it's just terrible
cuz you're not gonna use it spend 229 bucks get a nexus 7
you can outdated software a really bad camera on that
it almost gave me a slight headache because of the resolution range looking
yeah which is so too bad no by trying so
yeah even at half the price i would give it a
cash out the little bit of extra money for a nexus 7 or even
the asus has a 7-inch tablet which is the same price
i think that there are good choices out there
I mean really Dobie come on all right
Thank You Shannon Morse produces before you buy
well there you go you better watch out
Padre so our resident priest is holding a poker game on Friday night
but you can't right now you could take that Lenovo away
I like it but you know you know time will only tell so
we're top of cons verse and the only like combat
I think you guys will be slightly slightly aware of is depending on
I have put out already because I already have a video
if you guys enjoyed make sure you guys like and subscribe to the channel
I'm gonna be doing something very special guys
i'm going to do an honest review of it
if you took away the touch id button
on the bottom it has those larger top and bottom bezels
there's actually nothing so that is just a free side on the top
you have an expandable storage sd card reader
that can read up to 128 gigs of expandable storage
a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and then a usb type
c port for charging this tablet comes in at 1.12 pounds or 510 grams
they have this anti-blue light screen that they call it
the front-facing camera can only shoot in 480p
the dual speakers on the bottom are pretty good as well
you can expand that with an sd card
a 4 000 milliamp battery that they quote at 12 hours of usage
this one just feels so much more snappier
they also seem to open up faster as well
and you're kind of in and out of things quicker overall
it just feels like a little bit better performance on this basking sa8 battery
life has also been really impressive they quote 12 hours
you can game on this and most games play really smoothly
first i kind of wish that they would slim up these front bezels
maybe you want to do a little bit of gaming on this
that's the logo i feel like i'm gonna all right so yes
the tablet is like a sega computer in a way
can i see so as you can see
yes do it all right so this guy one
yeah well you can see all the time
the time is like 2024 format we will change that after
okay so so yes as you can see
it's like it's still like a tower because remember it's touch
what's this one is only so there's like there's nothing to move around
learn book quick settings secure on browser wi-fi manager and youtube youtube youtube
do we really know what's going on there
the tablet is not updated also so we will first check check update
you can do that also to our channel thank you
let's see our new youtuber as you can see the processor on the ebook
our learn book is not so fast like like an ordinary computer
another volume can also subscribe to that channel
so if that's showing on your thing you need to press subscribe
the the speaker speaker works so let's go ahead and select
oh that that one could be for most because it connected to the keyboard
there's a slot for for like for charger guessing
so this one here is for like a regular blackberry
those videos or quick plays on this channel or or is yeah
i can hear more of that song on the channel at ltv production
make sure you guys subscribe so back to the review
there you go so we're gonna go back we're gonna go back back
yes we're gonna see what's in the loan book so automatically sign it
y'all gotta see our process there but please wait
stop it starting so it exited as you can see no cards
or whatever for center loading books please wait
it will automatically loads up and you choose what subjects you're doing
i'm guessing this is a textbooks like the main textbooks for those classes forms
so i'm gonna see because there's like there's books like like looks like physics
let's see what we're doing um social interaction so he selects us
it's like that i more using the screen because i wanted to do faster
so it's saying we signed in or our google account or g email gmail
it was nothing so thing that you backed up and so yeah so
so let's see what's what we can do
the person who set up this computer has chosen to block this site
this has blocked this feature and block facebook
facebook facebook is out of it school purposes
there is not really so much thing that you can access amazon is awesome
yeah all right so we'll try it again
go back we enter chrome and then you can see the giveaway dropping straight
yeah so let's type in something more educational okay
i'm still i'll absolutely access for two years
hello all right so there is a messy
the app store is consist of updates for like see market
it's just update the previous app that is built in with the device
i don't know if the update or so
it feels good not wiki and it comes in a case
what is what those two cameras therefore here and here one here
we don't know if it's for zoom class as well
are there no zoom anything to access any more apps
the camera could be far for the messy display
we don't know as yet what's going on with those i guess later on
so yes i i guess this is all so overall empty
what do you rate it from a one a one to ten scale
only so it's not like you could access any other thing for school wise
the mean what is mean purposes to do
but i don't know why the google not working
that's a big minus because google is a important thing when in school
in general i give it a uh a five okay decent
but like as he said the the chrome the google beam block is
what is one of the main throw-offs yes yes because i can
he does a good search engine so yeah so negative five
no i'll change my retained three to three because the width
two is to be a tree because the two is like a
focus here because we don't have the 300 some us
the screen is very stick and that's the brick
i look like like a bullet bulletproof case that he's very
i don't know if the back the bucket could come out
i don't think he can come out so when it comes to that
that's what they do because it's down there

Hey guys! Today I'm going to talk about graphic tablet Gaomon m10k 2018 version
Inside the box we find the tablet Itself
A bag for the tablet 8 extra nibs and remover in the felt pouch
A micro-usb cable to connect tablet to computer
This is how a full set looks like
You just need to make the tablet upside down after changing mode
This tablet has 10 programmed keys which you can program as you want
m10k is 695g in weight, which ensures better portability and mobility
you can make more smooth and natural line
The back of the tablet has four rubber feet
so the tablet doesn't slip when you use it
There is also a jacket for holding a pen
so you won't have to worry about losing power and can work continuously
The matte plastic material is really comfortable when you hold it in your hand
I also want to tell you about the bag for the tablet
It's very important thing if you are going to take your tablet somewhere
A hand glove help you to move your hand easily on the tablet
Using this glove you don’t leave any marks on the tablet
A good thing that it takes only about a minute
It also depends on the settings you apply
I think I told you about all the important things related to this tablet
I really enjoy to use it in drawing
You can check all the links of this tablet in the description!
hi guys welcome to the start of another studio vlog
it's been it's been a been a couple of weeks
yeah i didn't vlog last week at all but i'm back happy monday
because that's better but i like sitting here
i like having dirty dream big behind me
uh i have just made myself a coffee um i yeah
i wasn't in a great headspace last week
uh if you don't follow me on instagram come find me
um that's usually where i post every day
um it's done me the world of good though because i feel great
no that's why there was no vlog last week so my to-do list
um and that is lots of ad mini bits orders from the weekend
i do need to do a little bit of prep for those
um i have a whole website page to build
i have been sent some new earphones now
what um people might think of me for um doing it
um because i hadn't seen anybody else share them
i think i'd seen catnip share some um and in the honest truth
um so i honestly i have been looking into like wireless earphones
um so they're here and i'm going to have a look at them
adaptive dual microphone technology filters out unwanted background noise
oh this is so nice so you put them out
owner's manual so activate bluetooth on your device
okay oh it just seems to be very easy really old
so there's different uh like sizes for your ears so these things
oh i don't know what i'm doing guys that's right
let's link it lift earphones from the charging case and select studio neo
okay we're working and it's not can myself it down
um let me have a look at the price of them
because that will determine a lot won't they're 69 pounds
i don't think that is bad at all
aren't the other ones like you know which ones i'm talking about
okay the sun seems to have calmed down a little bit now
so i'm kind of gonna move over a little bit if i can
um just the usual doubt in myself really
um but what's great about these zoom calls is
um the wire is very short on the charging cable
i'm just gonna try to not die of shame
um it's fine i'll i'll how do i get around that
i don't know i'm just going to pretend it didn't happen
so yeah i will go and do this
okay first zoom call of the day is done
right let me put them back in their case
i need to get into the habit of doing that
the meeting has been recorded and it is exporting right now
um zoom call prep and links have done that okay
my life was great till you added colors
um i've kind of got all my little ad
i'm i'm i'm still no closer to this being finished my brain hurts
i thought for the next 20 minutes before they come
just tidy up a little bit so first of all
sorry about my nails um from foxy ideas um and this is laura
because it's named it says here it's named after her childhood best friend
so that's lovely a little sticker and a little like postcard
thank you so much for the lovely note
oh my gosh oh jess thank you so much for this
i'm actually going to put some on my laptop so yeah i'm sorry
i can't open all of my packages on camera
the first one has come from bumble and blue bells
i actually think i've had something different from bumble
and bly bells beautiful like wax seals and things
let's see i just i love when packaging is just so beautiful
so this is sophie from bumble and bells
um but if you like anything you see
please go and support her over on instagram
um what sophie does is she makes these wax seals
hang on let me try and find a letter
i think i'll be putting this postcard in my scrapbook
so that's abby and i will leave abby's details below
what a lovely day for lovely post so
um i don't need to worry too much okay
it's much later and i can tell i've been here all day
i've just finished my second zoom call of the day
um yeah just let me know what you think
if you decide to get some so i am gonna go home now
it's shortcake and i've been getting a lot of questions
about what programs i use to animate and how i actually do it
all you need is a drawing program with layers and video editing software
that will give you a free product with your purchase of this tablet
i won't have too much of a struggle
this here is shortcake and she has a new redesign
basically what quarantine does to our hair from staying
i made a whole storyboard for an entire animation
i'd rather finish up re-watching attack on titan gotta catch up for season four
i start with the tip of the head by drawing the rainbow
then in another layer i redraw that rainbow but slightly higher next up
1 poop 2 poop 3 and so forth
i use black lines and basically ink over the red sketch
after inking every frame i go ahead and color with a fill
add some edgy music to it maybe slap on the background and then boom
because now it's time to review the gaomon m10k 2018
my first ever tablet which i got in 2014 was the wacom intervals
but it's very tiny and in a square shape
this tablet is light but also very sturdy
just don't drop your pen on hard cement force speaking of pen
the pen was pretty good with its 8192 levels of pressure it
the stylus also came in this very neat felt pouch but for me
i just put my stylus in the tag
choose your delivery options and on the top of add a payment method
it's the time for the cheap tablet from our friends from china
how you need to set it up okay
they didn't change out a lot of things and already i found an issue
another thing is and there can be construction area
there's quite some space between the lcd panel and the plastic casing itself
how bad the quality of the camera is so
of course you can also use the bluetooth capabilities
let's put it back in and this is just a freaking nightmare
oh boy okay so the question remains is this thing fake first of all
i could install it this time with the 2020 model
i couldn't install it whatsoever if i signed loaded or from the store
so there's the first lie and look at this 5.1 lollipop
there are differences basically on every level with the android display and the cpu
this is just moment more like it's too good to be true
this is just a fact but the question remains
i must say even for and fake spec and better set prehistoric model
that does not really have a very bad playback
yeah i know for people familiar to my channel
i see it a lot at this time so next up
hello everyone this is graham from unbox tech reviews where today
we're going to have a look at the me berry
i'll just start by having a look at the box you can see
it's got the i mei numbers because it's a dual sim designed by me
i've put in there to test out with it later
i'll try that on the tablet a little bit later
it's got an 8 000 milliamp battery and the rear camera is 8 megapixels
see what else we get so we've got a 1d card
i believe clean the cloth there get rid of them
which i believe is a couple of triple a batteries to get that worker
nice little added feature there a little stylus
see a nice bright display my app drawer underneath there
so it is compatible with the google play store
so this will connect to your wi-fi by via 2.4
now streaming directly from the muppet studio switch between the open ups pretty easily
so so and see the pinch and zoom works really well
so we'll work with simple games like roblox
all we'll have a quick look at the settings
so you can see it's used 15.66 out of the 64.
see everything runs pretty quick really nice switching between the open ups
i'll ins insert the sim card now just so you can see that
so i'll just quickly jump to that so there you can see
i put some sim cards in there and you can see
sim card slot one vodafone slot two o2 as you can see
picks up the signal really good just as good as my samsung phone
so go ahead and try the case on there
i will include some of the photos in the review at the end
so you can see the the quality that you get from there
hi Abby here something a little different this video
I'm going to do a review for a tablet
you're probably all inspiring artists and tablets are an amazing tool for artists
I'm reviewing today is the Galman 10 display pd-1 161
so how'd it perform after playing with it
I decided to do a drawing to test it out and please be gentle
which if you watch my update video you will know that
please excuse the horrendous test whenever thank you it gets a little bit better
to the tablet review it retails at around 180 pounds
which i think is a pretty good price for a display tablet
usually a display tablet is over 250 pounds
it came well packaged and the setup was very simple
you have more buttons to adjust the screen settings
it is a bit thin and small display wise
I didn't have any issues with the pen
and it has extra knobs in the holder
and set up your tablet to the right settings and button functions
I'd give this tablet a good 7 out of 10
I'll quickly mention a few pros and cons to wrap this up
and means you have it can have it on your lap
and it's easier setup and a big chunky slide tablet
I'd say it's just as good I'm much cheaper
I'm sorry I didn't do a better drawer for this
hopefully this was helpful to anyone interested in purchasing this tablet
and let's you know about things to consider when purchasing any tablet out there
I hope you're all staying safe in his blue attire
this isn't exactly the normal type of video
I'm just gonna put all of my cards out on the table early
it all off you know like one where
I'm grateful that they supplied me with a new tablet
what are you getting out of the box
I just decided to lay this sucker flat down on my counter
oh god both of them hurt so much
the good news is there's a funny pokemon riding your neck
the bad news is is that your neck looks like this
just plug the wires into their appropriate ports and bam
the only semi confusing part for some people might be installing the drivers
just visit the website in the instructions and hit download on what you need
thankfully the pen itself doesn't run on separate power
no separate power or a need to charge works right out of the box
I did run into a couple of issues for a little bit
a lot of my line art is done with no pressure sensitivity
the two fingered artist glove is made of a fabric that helps reduce friction
this package goes for about 184 dollars on Amazon
the question being is it worth that much for a beginner
I say that this is a worthwhile upgrade from a standard non display tablet
I didn't write an outro for this video
I use these together so first of all
there's a replacement in the cap so you simply drop out the new tip
and you're all good to go for another three or four weeks so
1.8 as to how the home screen is laid out
the folders are all laid out across the top
all you do is just touch on the folder
now you can see here across the top
you can add a new folder within that folder
I can look at all of my notes from the previous staff meetings
I use a broad stroke and I put down the date
so here's the date of January the 27th February the 3rd February the 10th
March the 2nd and so what I do and I'm just going to
I saved this just so I could show you in this demo
here are the items that I want to talk about in today's staff meeting
I don't need to put the client's name because I'm in that notebook
so if there's something in on this page that
I want to easily be able to find
I can take the highlighter and I can write here
I can see at a glance this date
I'm supposed to call Joe so for me
it's really awesome in a very very easy way for me to jump around
it gives me my folders across the top
what was a conversation about so this helps me
keep all of my activities and thoughts organized
I can make it very thick and now I can mark this up
she completely understands if I take this what I just did on here
this really really makes my life so much easier
and then you can make your edits okay in the same vein
let's say last year it was six hundred thousand
their materials and subs were two hundred thousand
which gives us real revenue spendable money of four hundred thousand and then
there's another erase feature where you can erase the selection what that means is
it gives me a blank piece of paper
I can jot down all of my notes
I can send this to the proper folder
I want to move it out to all right
find the notebook and make all the notes or is like now
I can just jot something down real quickly make a quick sheet
some people say it's too expensive quite honestly it's priceless for me
it's all right here in one place so two thumbs up for remarkable 2.0
so uh uh is together together come on another
i try to cheer up but i just feel the same
everybody needs some cause everybody needs some love
I'm Nathan with the e-book reader comm for this video
I'm going to give you guys a review with a Fire HD 8 tablet
it's among the latest lineup of new tablets from Amazon
there's just the size difference with the screen
so let's go ahead and talk about the hardware first
of course it's got the 10 or the 1280 by 800 resolution
we've got the camera up here in the top corner
it only has the 1280 by 800 screen
so that's 189 pixels per inch so I mean it's not too bad
it kind of reminds me of those so
this is the main home screen what it is is essentially your app drawer
you've got the store link so it's the same theme with every different section
here you got your continued watching and you got the recommended
better than the old carousel layout that you used to have
let's go ahead and remove this because kind of annoying removed from home
these ones are installed from the Amazon store
you can't really do as many customizations as you can like with the regular
we've got these on the list here options
if you wanted like a green background we've got the Goodreads integration up there
I'm going to show that in step review to talk about it more
I see things going as I think look tablet
it has two speakers on the top edge right here
and that's all so they project out quite well
Island as far as the volume is concerned
you can also use text-to-speech if you don't have the audiobook downloaded you
it'll play text-to-speech but I don't have any way to do that right now
it's also got the wikipedia entry down here
is you just type in select a different language
Amazon video services you can download videos and now that supports the SD card
you can even have the videos on the SD card which is nice
I did notice reading the manual that the SD card does not support audiobooks
so you can't move audio books or ebooks to the SD card
it does look quite good so comics illustrate the what
it actually looks quite good when you have it
I don't have any issues with touch screen
I'm gonna go ahead and wrap up this video right here
check out the e-book reader comm for some additional information
check that out if you want some additional information thank you guys for watching
I have gone with a Huey um I've used these guys before
there's about 50 pounds to buy this one it's currently a little bit more
it's got a battery feel free pen now
that's oh yeah the model is an inspiration
because that's what that's when they upgrade they put the battery for you
but let's ignore that that's fine so let's open up and have a look
we'll see if you're welcome if we like the tablet
the tablet itself comes in a nice nice packet
it's kind of a nice feel to it
I rarely use the hotkeys when I'm using one of these tablets
Wacom that I use it work and I've never configured to use I just
I'm just too used to the the shortcuts in Photoshop
the things to point out are the on the end
it's got a on and off because it's Bluetooth wireless Bluetooth
I tend to do sure you keep the wiring
I guess we'll find out what that's not
but yeah this the actual tablet so it's also a nice size
it's yeah it's about the size of the into us
Wacom which is a tiny little bamboo thing
I assume that these containing yes the nibs
I have never broken the nitwit touch wood touch wood
I know a lot of you wear them down
I guess I had to hold it with a tighter grip over time
this one looks a lot more like the
I know I've seen some people use the pen from up here
maybe that people who are used to using a paintbrush
so that's a good thing it's got two buttons
I assume they're configurable just like they are on most tablets usually
I don't as far as I can tell okay
I'm sure they're handy but I don't tend to use them very much
let's see how well it sits in here
I guess how much space you've got on your desk
I tend to like elebrate so just grab it straight out there
just pop those back in other things we've got
I can't complain about that doesn't again doesn't feel too cheap at all
so considering the price of the tablet versus some of the more expensive tablets
Pro that I'm using at work but it does feel that much wider
you know the it kind of throws you a little bit
I'm just talking over the recording rather than actually talking while I draw
it wasn't able to do that and concentrate
but yes there's no no no lag while
do you think it's ever so slightly lighter than the
I use it at all so it's quite happy with that
so that's that's probably one one down tick verses
V into us that you might get so the overall impressions of the tablet
I had some little problems with the older huy on top
I needed to get a specific version of the driver
the newer drivers just didn't work with the tablet for whatever reason so
who knows if future drivers will have problems
I'm quite happy with using it like and as you can see
he'll it'll manage to to operate for a good long time
I mean I've never had a tablet actually break on me so that's good
I think I'd probably give the tablet about an 8 out of 10
the you know it comes in a really nice box
it could have been it could have felt bit sturdier
but it's that's a you know quite a minor thing
usability of the tablet again with the with the connectivity
being so fluid to go between wireless and connected by the cable
I'm actually really interested to see what huion do over time
because they are getting better with each kind of with each product
I get they seem to be getting you know
Wacom to task and providing a good range of different sizes and different things
Wacom one I'll go for the three to four hundred
I'd probably give her an eight out of ten
and that's that's not something you can complain about for for
I'm watching hope you enjoyed my terrible creatures
but yeah thanks for watching guys see you later
we're reviewing the top 10 android tablets for gamers travelers and everyday users
Intel quad core Atom processor and the latest version of Android OS
black dual-core this thing is less than 75 bucks yet
it does almost everything that an asus or samsung tablet does
it's just a little bit slower all around but it isn't slow overall
read the news or do some basic web browsing
Android tablet that has a HD IPS screen
and you don't get the prestige of having a name-brand otherwise
Android tablet here is the chromo 7-inch Android tablet
but it's the cheapest tablet on our list
you not only get a great 7-inch tablet with a beautiful screen
but you get an expandable microSD card slot
Samsung Galaxy Tab s 10 and a half inch tablet
that's the sharpest screen of any tablet on our list
but this is an incredible tablet that gets amazing reviews
it's the surprisingly high quality dragon touch 10 inch dual-core tablet
this incredible tablet has a dual-core CPU and a quad-core GPU
you don't need to spend hundreds of dollars on a tablet
number two is the latest Nexus 7 from Google and made by Asus
power tablet will get anything done for you and because it's made by
Google it integrates with all of your Google accounts perfectly right
all the information and pricing on these amazing tablets number one is the best
in fact it only weighs 0.61 pounds and it's only 0.35 inches thick
lets you use it as a universal remote control for your TV
it has built-in cameras that you can use for video chat on
400 customer reviews and averages over 4 stars
all the information and pricing on these amazing tablets
hey everybody its LAN sideburn and we're checking out the RCA cambio today
Target stores here in the United States for about two hundred dollars
so it's got some flexibility as to how you can configure it
nothing too fancy on the latching mechanism here either
it's not too bad on the viewing angle side
it's not going to be as good as more expensive
the display is certainly passable compared to what we've seen in other places
I do like the keyboard quite a bit
it isn't too bad the one thing that was interesting about it
is that if you click right in the middle
nothing happens because there's a divider line here between the left
so you can't do a two-finger click but you can do a two finger
I got that HDMI port that we talked about
it might be a little bit slower than the storage
erase the tablet but it does actually reset the tablet
there is a camera on the back in the front
nothing to be excited about but you can take some some decent pictures
I guess but it's not really going to do well as a photographing device
so let's take a look now and see how it performs all right
let's take a look at my youtube channel
and it really is a decent experience overall and on the octane benchmark test
a little bit harder to navigate with this less expensive trackpad on here
there right now is not going to run on here very well
things like stream games from other devices in the home
this is a year versus 90 days that
this is LAN size and thanks for watching
I requested that I be able to be honest
wow this is the guy we're gonna be reviewing here the artist 12
that's really cheap but yeah let's get started
well let's see what we got alright so we open up the box here
you've got a contact information if you run into any trouble cute little
Corgi mascot pull this guy out so at first glance it's super compact
there's still a lot more box to go through
oh well that's cool so it actually comes with the stand
Wacom tablet did not come with a stand
that's an extra charge so good on you
XP pen that's that's awesome and it feels alright
I'll have to mess with that in a bit
we'll probably have to read the instructions on that one twelve months not bad
not if you drop it in a tub of water or anything
thank you for choosing to support XP tablets
I get asked about my smudge guard a lot
I mean the fits not the greatest I definitely like my smudge guard
a lot more but for something that comes free with the tablet
it's nice that it comes with extra pen
nibs pretty long which is not a good or a bad thing just something
you know they don't feel mushy or anything
they feel like good quality it feels like they care about their product unlike
I didn't want to break it so this part flips out somehow
get it nice and situated here so you guys can see ooh and then
uh everybody's favorite part about new electronics the P Alize
oh okay so now that we've done our unboxing
I don't know how I feel about that stand
I might suggest getting a different stand for you
um let's see okay so on my laptop
it says it has 8,192 levels of pressure sensitivity
the human hand can't actually differentiate between that many levels of pressure
see how it goes and the pen actually has tilt function which is cool
I thought only Wacom would have which that's really cool
I almost never use even on my tablet
and yeah overall the look of the tablet itself
it looks like a good piece of construction
we'll see how it feels when we actually draw in it ok so now
I'm gonna try and get this tablet to display the same display
I'm gonna press that in to turn it on there we go
we don't even have to do anything to have it display on here
it just does it automatically all right moment of truth
it's got a little bit of a matte
this pen doesn't have an eraser typically with
Wacom pens this opposite side would have a pressure sensitivity eraser
I would use a hot key or something so yeah
I have to say like first impressions using this thing
it's not too bright and it's not too dim
we'll see what they do will also open up the driver
which um you know is kind of the biggest deal with these off-brand tablets
let's uh see if there's any pressure sensitivity by default wowie-zowie
getting that thing to work just uninstalling drivers reinstalling it
so yeah let's uh open up the driver
LKR oh is that the the wheel function it is ok
but it's saying different modes down at the bottom so right now
it's it's not smooth and I actually like that
oh that's kind of cool if I press it again
I'm very impressed with the driver on this tablet
so let's set that to middle click is what
so that's pretty cool that's useful just for ease of use
I'm gonna set it back to duplicate display for now that way
the pen doesn't seem to be working anymore
that's probably depending on how you like to draw but zero feels very comfortable
but that's cool that you can customize that
you need to either turn it on or turn it off it really
sometimes that can make a difference express key settings
what happens when I click in the wheel can I click it in nope
so if you're doing frame by frame animation that could be useful
we'll just leave it as default for now so cancel and it seems like
it's not super smooth to draw on but nothing
yeah dang XP pen I love this thing
I pay 250 dollars for this absolutely yeah
is you know it feels portable like this thing is super light
I wish this was a self-contained unit but it's not
your computer doesn't have to be super close
what happens if I shut the screen on my laptop
is there a pen that we can do with tilts on it
I guess it is but you have to push down a little bit
it seems to work from a certain angle
I mean of course but that's something you'd have to get used to well
most of these off-brand tablets don't have a tilt function
I'm trying to think of a bad thing to say about it
I'm used to drawing pretty tiny so I would be fine with this
another thing to complain about is maybe the pen doesn't feel the greatest
it doesn't really have any heft to it
the pen feels fine the nib like I was saying is plastic
and you know when you're drawing on the screen
it certainly doesn't feel like paper um just for for fun
we can try putting on this anti glare screen on it
I immediately know I'm not gonna like this
it's getting a lot of bubbles and stuff
I wasn't very careful about putting it on
I probably wouldn't put the screen protector on
some of the pros about it there was no parallax to be seen
the stand that comes with is very unstable
I would recommend getting a different stand for it
and probably my least favorite part about the tablet is its HDMI
only which if you don't have a computer that has an HDMI port
thank you for listening to my tablet review and
First, let's take a quick look at an overview of the features.
The Parblo Mast 22 is a display tablet
you can draw on with a pressure-sensitive pen.
That makes this a great tablet for large-gesture drawing.
don't go near the edge of the screen.
The color gamut is wide, but color accuracy is a bit off.
My Spider5 colorimeter measured Adobe RGB at 79%.
The pen is very basic and it requires charging before you can use it.
The transitions and the line within opacity are even.
wear out, you have eight replacement nibs hiding inside of the pen stand.
Also, I noticed that double-click doesn't register some of the time.
So that just about sums up the pen.
Let's move to the exterior of the device.
Instead of being made of mostly plastic, it's made of metal.
The cable connections are a little bit weak.
I'd be concerned about them breaking or becoming disconnected by accident.
There are not any express keys on the exterior of the Mast 22
and the driver does not offer on-screen keys.
There's only a small gap between the tablet edge and the desk.
UI doesn't take up too much of the screen.
Once you get extended mode working with the UI scaling set
I don't see a way to disable that.
In regards to the driver quality, the drivers are a bit buggy.
I found that I've had to uninstall and reinstall them on several occasions
just to get the cursor to appear on the correct screen.
22 is an adjustable stand that attaches securely to the tablet.
(funky music) All right. So now for my conclusion.
All right, so that was my review of the Parblo Mast 22 display tablet.
And if you're new to my channel, click that Subscribe button and check out
Thanks for watching and I'll see you next time.
hi this is justice with tablet pro in this quick video
i was inspired by brett from oz tablet review
so i'm going to show you his youtube page here
this is brett oz tablet pc and uh he has really great content
let's go ahead and open this up right here
droid cam come on all right but droid cam client download right there
the install is very very simple and it's very small
i can take notes if i'm watching because i can't see anything
i'm looking at the back side of my camera
i can't see the screen and i can't see the other person so here
and let's go over here and let's select one of brett's videos okay
we're just going to play this one as a small business owner
i can watch the screen if i want again
10 tablet and a stylus subscribe to this channel
it is made for you until next time
it's an external monitor that connects to your computer
Windows or Mac and you can draw on it using the included pen
there's been a lot of competition and that competition has really improved
and so you have all these companies releasing cheaper pen displays so what
sometimes taking something away it can be a good thing nice
sometimes taking something away can be a bad thing
so what are the trade-offs what have they done to bring the price down
Cintiq 16 I have here and compare it to the Cintiq Pro 16
the biggest difference here is the screen itself
and so you're gonna get a crisper image
Wacom calls this optical bonding basically what it does is it
this screen is a film on the pros
so why get this why go with a walk-on for me
the most compelling reason is this this is what comes pro pen too
I've used the pro pen too before on the Cintiq pro 24
the pressure curve feels very natural in the illustration
I'm doing in the background when I'm coloring in
I should also mention because I tend to forget cuz it's not a feature
I use a lot but this stylus has tilt support
that's fairly rare in many other third-party devices in fact
the screen itself looks really good and I really like the 16 inch size
accuracy have one monitor calibrated to be super accurate
and then they're using something else to draw on anyway
accuracy can you tell me what color you see on this chart
Wacom has on its website available for about $80
it should be available in the store by the end of the month
it attaches to the back of the display
so if you wanted to use another stand you could do that too
I did miss here that I've seen on other tablets are shortcut keys
my script says rewrite that sentence brad oops just be clear
how did I miss that now one thing
I do want to talk about a little bit
I do like Wacom software and how their drivers are set up
so let's talk a little bit about pros and cons
here you're getting wha comes best pen ever at their lowest
my personal opinion is that the quality of the pen is the main thing
I'm looking for in any drawing tablet and since this does that so well
maybe it's an experiment to see what the market wants either way
thank you guys for watching and I'll see you in a couple of dates
this video is going to be different than my usual
so you're able to draw on the screen in the box
they need to be plugged into a laptop or a computer here
speaking of the pen you get two of them for some reason
so there is no gap in between the glass and the screen
this tablet is on the smaller side and is definitely portable here
it is next to my 10.2 ipad as a size comparison on the left
we have six customizable express keys and on the right
we have the spots for the cords to plug in
we also have the power button and the display brightness button
so next was setting up the tablet which went smoothly
they say you can use a standard phone charger
but i think it would be nice if they gave you an adapter thankfully
my laptop plugged in while using the tablet
i'm sorry if i'm not and he is around 17 years old
it's just a simple three-quarter bust drawing like i mentioned
i actually just went with the first oc i found in my email
submissions because i had just posted a gotcha character video at the time
and so i just went through my emails until i found an oc submission
the monitor did help a lot with the mouse cursor
this is a common thing for tablets to do
i started by applying the shadows and placed those where i wanted them
i feel like this gave the hair a really neat
look so this tablet is nice to work on
when it came to the size i was working at the pressure
the tablet doesn't take up very much space
i don't have a ton of desk space in my room
so the fact that this tablet is so tiny is kind of nice
it just takes up a little portion of it
the film applied to the screen is also really nice
i think this is a really reasonable price
so how do i rate my experience with the vk 1200 i give it
he was a lot of fun to draw
these drawing tablets come in two sizes small and medium
the small has a live area of six inches by 3.7 inches
Intuos tablet comes in three colors black pistachio and berry cherry berry
I like the extra space that the medium gives me in the last generation
the small felt a little cramped at times
but if you're on a budget it definitely gets the job done
Hey look at this there shortcut keys along the top
you can map these to any keyboard shortcut
Pro has you wind up reaching one hand over the other hand
it's a little bit awkward since even the medium is really thin and compact
I thought it might be too light and slide around on my desk
the battery lasts a surprisingly long amount of time usually if
I use it for a few hours at a time
a lot of tablets say hey it feels like paper
Intuos line when we're talking about digital drawing
this is my favorite surface to draw and it just feels right
it almost feels like it has a rubbery edge to it
it's got four thousand levels of pressure sensitivity
well it has a good initial activation rate apply
same with brushes to change opacity and get darker as you apply more pressure
there are no jitters check and if you're traveling with it
the pen fits snugly into the little loop
you're in luck tucked into the back of the new pen
I got used to it but I still think
while you're drawing over here also use it as a mouse
I didn't run into any problems at all
I also liked the settings in their software
I've used a lot of third-party devices over the last couple years
I use the tablet on both screens as a mouse
replacement if your pen is mapped to both screens
it could be a little awkward to draw with things can feel smooshed
usually this requires you to go into the settings and say hey
flash animate whatever that program is called now huge time-saver
so what are the drawbacks of the new intros
when I first got everything installed things were a little bit quirky
so nothing huge and it also looks like
it's not quite as good but it gets the job done really what
Wacom is usually going for is trying to be the best out there
so you're paying for the quality you're paying for that good
you're paying for those better drivers as far as price
you can choose one of these two programs these small with bluetooth
you can choose two of these three programs
if you're drawing comics or manga or a line art
let me know down below in the comment section
we'll see kind of on the edge of that one
got a lot of bit of work to do still but that's all
I'll see you guys in a couple of days

Fire HD 10 and has a rubber bumper
the 2 year warranty is there to ensure if any accidents do happen
that provides amazing viewing angles and bright colors
being a solid camera for children to interact with battery
it also does come with a stylus that you can use it
not not not great not iPad quality or Samsung quality
you may notice about this device as far as the body goes
Augen 10 Touch 78 these are the same exact body
they've just done a little changes on them one of the things
this is a host and on the go
I did try keyboard and mouse with and they
that was something that was promised on the
Augen jente and did not work on the back of the device
if you have problems your power button and your menu button
one of the big differences as far as this device goes to the
SD card mini SD card up to 16 gigabyte
would you'd like to have on a tablet so that's kind of an issue
it does come with kind of a little overlay here
I said it has your home button volume up volume down menu back
button shows your Wi-Fi your battery your time
I don't really find a need for that
it's kind of a weird feature to have
you just press the button for the apps this is all
it's relatively speedy you know it's the typical 2.1
obviously it would be faster with the improvements
they made there possibly could be an update
so it's gonna be you know on sale for a very cheap price
I obviously can't install any apps so there's a big problem
you can obviously sideload apps if you know anything about
you can try sideloading some of your apps on here
I was able to put it launcher pro on here before I did that
I'm just some video here this is Buck Bunny
the speaker doesn't have the greatest of sound headphones
but it's nice to the device at least can handle this so
I could see maybe for you know a younger child
you know for 139 this is a great little
it's nothing compared of to the to the Samsung Galaxy Tab at you
there's a you know to listen to music
I don't think it's the perfect device and at that price
hopefully that will be fine but with a firmware that
comm and this was a review of the Sylvania seven-inch mini tablet
y'all make up your mind about buying it

I use show box from time to time
y'all know about show box but that's just everything right there me personally
I'm doing a review of the who yawn wh1 4:09 tablet
this tablet out by creating a character design from a mood board
I'd like to start out by mentioning a little something about the drawing
so I'm gonna do a few sketches and some character exploration
this entire speed painting was created with this
I made a list of pros and cons
so we're gonna start out with the pros
this tablet has a ton of customizable buttons
those are the things that I use the most
I thought it would be very convenient to have them on the little buttons
a drawing surface on this tablet is huge
this tablet is 8100 - which is great
I'd have to say my favorite part about using this tablet was sketching
it felt very natural with that level of pin pressure
almost like you are using a pencil you can use
this tablet wired or wirelessly is really nice
I looked through the entire box and I was like am I crazy
the retail value of this tablet and it is 159
this isn't too big of an inconvenience since you can
I don't know how long the battery life is on the pin
I do not have to charge the pin
you know go back to the old way that
I used to do it and you know play with the sliders in Photoshop
it's almost like playing an instrument the way
I put my left hand on the tablet
I not had a certain way of working with my usual tablet
this would be an amazing option for me
I highly recommend this option and for the price
I hope you guys enjoyed watching the speed painting I did using this
Huyen tablet if you found this review helpful
please leave a like and subscribe to the channel
thanks for watching and I'll talk to you in the next video bye
everyone welcome back to another video and yes at this point
we have the jumper each book six plus and this is yet another
it's comes in this foam piece right here
the tablet and the charging adapter that runs at 12 volts 2 amps
that has this type of connection on the front
so let's go ahead and take it off
ouch but not only that it's a screen protector
that is pretty easy to scratch up so once again
this is a 1080p 11.6 inch IPS panel and on the front
now yes the tablet does have some pretty thick bezels
so we don't block your screen when watching your video or reading a document
three fingers are usually out of the way on the front
there's actually no back camera but not like you're gonna be using that anyways
who knows maybe we'll see that in the extra vision on the bottom
and on the right side you'll find a full-size
USB port a micro HDMI port and the charging port
on to the left side we got the volume rockers
and that's all you get for this tablet
have some pretty decent travel distance which actually feels pretty good
the spacing on their hand is a bit too tight
so it'll take some time to get used to when typing on this keyboard
three speeds are pretty okay for an EMC storage
it does boot up things to launch pretty quickly
2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi networks so to put it simply
so let's go ahead and do that all right so at this point
and what do you know it just connected someone just messaged me on
it's gonna run terribly like 12 of PS
now it shows it is connected but the connection is simply not there
yep depending on what you connect to these
so now we're are running at 4k and anything below
4 K obviously is gonna run at full speed and right
what is the best alternative to this thing right here
now taking a quick look back at the display here
although has some pretty good viewing angles and overall it looks pretty good
it's very visible on a black canvas or a black display
land bleed now speaking of the display here
well it actually works fairly well and it's very responsive which is surprising and
uh strictly the pros and cons first of all the display here overall
it's got a 1080p resolution it's IPS and overall the colors
considering what other tablets can do the only way you can charge
is actually a better life so a better life here
Today we're taking a look at Pioneer's latest tablet all-in-one computer.
T3, this is the third generation of the Dash tablet.
I have it paired with a couple matching peripherals.
So tablet and all-in-one computer, all in one.
A standard base without USB ports, or a wall mounting option.
For information on the Dash T3 tablet, please visit us at POSGuys.com. Thanks!
i'm carlos and uh i have a problem i have a welcome
i gave one of these away last year
and they've made some really cool improvements to this version
so we're going to take a look at the outside
meaning we're going to look at the connections
what you need to connect this to the computer
what we're going to do is take a look at the outside
then we can take a look at some of the extras
one of the things i like about this
they did a really good job putting this thing together
i love the fact that it's super clean right now
well this comes with a stand that if i wanted to
it's the same what i do like about this stand is this lever
here is very easy to get to even if you have
it's all very well put together and again
and there's another connection up at the very top that is for headphones
let's take a look at the other stuff that comes with your xp pen
they actually went battery free which is incredibly cool
another thing that they did as far as the stylus goes
and then it's got this flare towards the tip right
not quite as much if you take a look
one is also hard plastic but i actually found some felt hard felt
i'm assuming it's felt but it's more of a softer more grippy
almost like it feels almost like a cloth
when you're drawing the xp pen nib is pretty comfortable
this stylus definitely does feel a lot better
okay so let me let you in on the little secret with xp pen
xp pen understands that their products are on the affordable side of the spectrum
so if i were to open this up
so if i click the plus button here you see i have quicktime open
but it's either the pa5 or the pa6
chances are that you just need to click that button again
it's happened to me a whole bunch of times
i thought maybe i broke something or maybe
but what it was was i had the eraser instead of the brush
so down here on the left you can set the pressure sensitivity adjustments
now we've taken a look at the back
we have it connected to the computer now
click go over to options open at login
you want to have this going so you
by the time you go to be creative and now
let's take a look at drawing in photoshop with an xp pen
i automatically the way i have my cintiq set up
at the first generation of this was kind of clunky to be honest
they've they've actually improved the drawing experience quite a bit i am
let's go to my other favorite drawing program
i like the combination of sketchbook and xp pen together
it's just a little bit but to be honest
their quality of product is incredible for example
i bought this one about five years ago for about twelve hundred dollars
1200 brand new 600 or or you can get this one for free
all you have to do is make sure that you're subscribed to my channel
i'll pick a random winner and then i'll send you this guy for free
if you win what i'll do is i'll go to instagram or twitter
hey it's Josh of Gotham and or authority
what's going on everybody and this is a Sony
you'll see this notion permeate throughout the review but first
let's take a look at design in this 10-inch tablet
always a welcome feature of a tablet experience one of the first things
and it makes this one of the thinnest and nimblest tablets
this is a good change from the rigid corners of the original end
so you might find yourself throwing this tablet around like
you get the same advantages on this much
backed by the audrina 330 and three gigabytes of RAM provide the sheer power
the tablet is able to perform the same noise canceling as the smartphone
within what kind of struck me the most about this tablet was well
cameras on tablets are always a bit tough to give big recommendations to primarily
you won't get anything from this camera that rivals the smartphone
that's maybe sitting on the table in front of you
it doesn't really try too hard and like
I always say when you keep it simple you keep it fast
you can get the quick settings that are editable
that go over your workspace for quick multitasking
iterations out there so you can get the Sony
but in a way you can argue that you get what you pay for
Sony is entry into the tablet game started over a year ago
and that is definitely what the z2 tablet feels like
I said I’m done with reviews, and I am, but there is one tablet
The one I reinstalled after every single product review.
The one I drew on almost every day for five years.
When I started an art business I invested in a Wacom Cintiq 27QHD Touch.
Yes these tablets are expensive, but again, this is a business for me.
I wanted a tablet I wouldn’t have to replace for years.
Pro 24, which is what I’ve been using daily ever since.
Did they tell me to make a review?
Yes. First of all, the old 27QHD, too big.
I had the option to try the 32” Pro but I wanted the 24”.
I can treat it like a second monitor.
It’s amazing. My setup makes using the physical keyboard awkward, but that’s my problem.
I never could get the hang of onscreen keyboards.
I type like a shark going after a bloody steak.
Gotta feel the keys, put my teeth in that meat.
I accidentally touch stuff with my palm when it’s on.
I could easily bash a hole in the wall with this thing.
And even a mechanically disinclined idiot like me can put this one together.
I had to hack my desk because it didn’t have enough lip.
Oh yeah, don’t try to mount an arm on a piece of cardboard.
Uuuuuuuughhhhh Funny thing about the old 27 QHD.
My cat jumped on it and the screen didn’t get scratched.
Not that it would do much against these devil claws of justice.
You want to know what drove me nuts about the 27QHD?
Back in with the Mac users I guess.
Every time. Also interesting: after four years of use the 27QHD got the blues.
And when it fell asleep, it woke up blue.
Had to turn it off and on again.
You’ll be drawing for two/three hours and then all of a sudden WHHHHHHHHHHRRRRR.
Gosh I’m so sensitive to noise I just ugh.
Why is its fan so loud! It won’t simply stay off or on.
Is this a problem with the receiver inside my Cintiq Pro?
Someday I’ll get ticked enough to dismount the tablet and look.
update that fixes one problem and causes another.
Both tablets do the thing where it says
Does this happen to anyone else, or is it just me?
Oddly, whenever that box pops up is when the tablet bugs out.
The 24 chugs along despite the fake battery warning.
because the preference file itself gets corrupted, so restoring from a backup wouldn’t work.
If I’m having a weird issue, reinstalling the drivers works 95% of the time.
By the way driver nonsense after updates is absolutely not unique to Wacom.
Moho, or heck, even a simple internet browser.
Be sure you can plug what you’re getting into your computer or laptop.
Find out if the tablet works in your drawing program before you buy.
The Cintiq Pro is 4k. Oh yes. Ohhhhh yes. I’m happy.
The Pro pen recognizes 8,000 levels instead of the old beast’s 2,000.
But it came in the box and that’s what I like, okay? Overall impressions.
hello you lovely lot and welcome to a new video today
sorry for having to tablet reviews back to back
I've tried so I was very excited to give it a go
I will say so if I don't like it I'll say so
hopefully you know how it goes by now
this just allows me to compare each tablet fairly without wondering if any problems
no bells or whistles very plain but I just really liked it
I'm thinking this tablet is probably more made for use with laptops
there is a button on the pen which you can change the function of
this pen is that it doesn't have a battery and it doesn't need recharging
it didn't feel like it was wobbling around whereas with some other cheaper brands
it didn't have anything which means you could potentially lose your pen easily again
the starti 9:6 are also comes with four shortcut keys
which as mentioned you can have on either side of the tablet
you can even have the tablet in portrait format if you want
I didn't try that because I don't have the space for it
I found them easy to set up with the appropriate shortcuts
they wanted and I set mine to undo to open the tablet software
I left it on the default sensitivity settings to familiarize myself with them
the surface has a subtle green which feels fairly paper
the tablet worked thoughtlessly with both of them
I would say that you might have issues if you have
I was really pleasantly surprised with this tablet
so it'll help me navigate better and in case
I ever want to draw or do any video editing on the laptop then
Android phones and tablets and not just your computer and it performed consistently well
the setup was simple and I found no overall hiccups I using it
it's simple straightforward and genuinely nice to use
I can't round off a video without talking about the character
but in the meantime this is my huffing fighter
please let me know if you have any questions
you can find links in the description below non-affiliated
but if you want to check them out please do
thank you so much for supporting my content and enjoying what
I can't believe you are a sellout or something and well yes
I was a messaged by someone from gaomon
could you review a tablet and this is odd since
I don't really have that much experience with tablets
I mean I researched this as much as I could
I thought it would just be something new to do while
they'll take up a lot of room next
you got a lot of notches and such
it's sturdy you also come with the pen
and that's that's not even a joke so moving on to the actual tablet
I hope that I really need to get like a better camera
okay here we go so onto them onto the actual tablet
we have some power on buttons some menu buttons
you also see these uh buttons on the side
I guess I could find a way to like use these I might
we have all the things like the work area the
we're making black spaghetti and I'm just showing you the curvatures and so far
I don't know why that is is kind of odd
so yeah it works on the internet and everything else so
what should I draw with my new tablet and what program should I use
Ross painting a picture of Bob Ross painting a sonic OC
Steven universe for we might do that this but don't actually okay draw this
I'm just gonna do this by memory because why not so
everyone knows that a good bore picture always starts with a an enormous circle
this is probably gonna be really sketchy cuz uh mspaint does not have layers
I know it's eyes are kinda like Squidward ish
of course we have to have the inside stomach view
let's see what should we put in the middle
let's just let's just make stick figures cuz
I can't be bothered to put too much detail in such a small space
I must I must say you look mighty scrumptious today
I don't know I'm assuming he's like wearing pants
yes that that would be a good move
do you think any any other tablet can create such a masterpiece
I don't really have any major problems with it
it was a Wacom Intuos and not that any of that is the point
I personally don't use things like that but I know some artists do
is that the other end of the pen is not usable
it's just making my fingers feel weird but who knows
maybe you'll like it if you're accustomed to it
I really traveled down this interesting route whole rabbit hole back in the day
2005 like tablets weren't exactly heard of especially drawing tablets in particular
I should say I was very much impressionable at the time because you know
I did notice the fact that being that this is such a small tablet
I guess would be the best word I could think of saying
usually some artists like to draw a lake with short strokes
I'm one of those artists that like to do
this is her skin and this is her skin
my lines aren't perfect so this is kind of minor usually
I just got tired of that and I was like
I definitely do think I like it a little bit more open
she doesn't look too serious and so right now
which if any of you guys have seen
I guess you could say particularly with her glowing tattoo
and so i zoom in to sort of get all the detail so like
there is a limit but much more than I could with traditional art
I'm not sure if I'm just accessing it wrong
guys this tablet that has really thoroughly impressed me for $30.00
obviously some issues with the pen no eraser
the size is a little bit small but but other than that
I want to give a review of the Wacom tablets specifically for photographers
this one's pretty nice and we also have the intuos pro
Wacom one and I had never even heard of this one
it's super cheap and it's like 60 bucks
it's got four programmable buttons so it makes it really nice to use versus
but the so you can see the difference here but this with a the
it's very large compared to the other ones
I'll think it's much heavier so it has a really good feel to it
I don't know if you can see that
I've had no problem at all so this one else has a touch setting
it turned off because usually my hand ends up
I don't want it to so I've just turned that off it
I think it's mini-usb so it's kind of the older style of connection
they didn't have the wireless time at the time that
so if you're gonna be traveling with these
I travel a full time in an RV
I do tend to work in odd places like libraries and stuff at times
so how about sometimes really portable is nice
so it's kind of a toss-up between those two again
I feel like they're pretty much the same weight so they both would work
it does have a eraser on the other end
I think it's like 70 bucks so not something I would do
it has kind of a rubbery surface to it
it's not a really nice thick rubber like their pro one
this one is just kind of like a little bit sticky so
also has two buttons one long one short and a slight texture on them
it's very skinny very light and just has no
so this probably won't show up on video but just the feeling of this
I just love using this one and then the Intuos feels pretty nice
I don't know if we'll be able to hear this
but here's the pro and here is the into us
I don't know if the Intuos works the same
so the battery life seems to be really good so
so you just click this plus button here to add a specific applications
turns it into the zoom tool so now
two options makes it super easy to get around so some settings
you should know about in photoshop up here
I'm in the brush tool you can see here and in the options bar
there's these two icons one here and one here so this one tells
Photoshop that you should change the opacity based upon the pressure
there's nothing too special about it so rather than do that
based upon how hard address we keep the same opacity
I just leave both of these on so that it's the pressure
I was going to show you how these tablets work differently
sensitive is become a lot more important but for photographers
I like to leave both of them on
let me make this a lot bigger so now
I don't have very good control with this
I usually combine this using my TK panel to create luminosity masks
is assigning one of your function buttons to the spacebar so
I forget which one it does and okay so that allows you
whenever you hold down the spacebar it turns into the pan tool
there's lots you can do with this and like
scroll wheel on the pro version but you can see
it just does this jerky zooming by a large amount
and it doesn't zoom where you want it to
it's just going to zoom to the center of damage so
I don't use that so it's not that great of a feature
maybe there's some other use for it but I haven't found anything yet
it's just a little bit too jerky all right so now
let's talk about what size of tablet we need so all of these that
I would say most people just need the small size
I'm using Photoshop so what I've done here is
I've set up a custom application for Photoshop
I've done is I've set it to be just two monitor
I can use my entire thing for both screens
I would probably recommend getting the medium size
and if you have a giant monitor like 30 inches or bigger
then you might consider getting a medium-size tablet
I really wouldn't recommend that unless you absolutely have to
I found the small to be just fine
I think all right so I hope you guys enjoyed this review
Mouse so I highly recommend one and the Wacom tablets are just awesome quality
hey folks Tyler Allen here illustrator concept artist and instructor today
it does seem to be like right off the bat
alright everything's kind of laid out in here pretty accordingly
coming in here for a bit of a closer look
here's the black artists glove the USB cable the multi-language instruction manual the pen
now in the nice little soft case but yeah
let yet that just you know innately come with a little case for it
pen it's slightly thinner than my usual into s1
Express keys up here at the top again
I want to point out here depending on the type of user
is you put it on a desk draw it
I can't exactly test the duration of that
it's not going to be popping out and that's a problem
it has a lot of these basic features
I usually like to do in addition to maybe like the right mouse button
I don't know if it will let me allow it to program at that
it's letting me do numbered keys or our letter keys
rather you know backspace no shift or no no kind of actual function keys
so that's interesting now for the work area
I was also getting interesting results with this as well
so right now it's set to my first display but what
there's a little bit of finicky nough sand
that's got a lot of thick thickness and angle adjustments to see
I can build things up all these normal settings so this is a brush
I'm thumb drawing just simple shapes too rough and I'd probably use it
well if you're on a budget you know it's gonna get you by fine
it's definitely better than a traditional mousepad for sure if you're an Android user
it's probably gonna be for you as well as you
I like to figure out and plan a lot of these lines
I like a screen a drawing like a Cintiq
I see people playing like Sue Gideon Solid Edge and stuff
and and of course the beauty of this is
Japanese inspired but either way the beauty of it is I will get to
I hope this was informative for you and take care
just like every new device the joy 11 gets preceded by a new successor
it now comes with an updated spec sheet and a totally new design
i clearly understand the decision to make this product
feel a little premium with the metal build but statically
i'll let you be the judge to comment
the metal keyboard unfortunately doesn't offer a great typing experience with its flat keys
the trackpad uses windows drivers and it is extremely steep to press on
i suggest that you purchase the ladder keyboard cover instead of the metal keyboard
the new joy 11 isn't significantly faster than its predecessor
the joy 11 delivers 5 hours of continuous use just like its predecessor
it is priced at 899 ringgit while its keyboard dock and the joy
because they capitalized the e at the end you know
I gave myself about a six out of ten
Mons request if you want to check them out cool cool
I haven't really seen on other tablets before
but we're gonna get more into that later
we got a drawstring begi to hide all your secrets go in the sack
we're gonna poke at the side thing and pull out the cord
I'm not gonna open all that I'm just I'm gonna put it back
let's look at the pen for this again
let's just put this on uh-huh yeah now
I don't use a lot of pen pressure
unique is the little circle button on the side
I did get it to work on Photoshop and newer programs
the tablet itself is pretty light yet sturdy
it didn't even give me the not responding or closing of the program
it's a very decent tablet and pretty standard
I don't know what that means but neither do you
and we're taking a look at the matrix pad s 30 now
this is full-on 10-inch octa-core tablet and it runs
there is almost no lag on top of that
it also supports basic things that a lot of
Cheaper tablets don't support for example has an octa-core processor it
which makes things really really cool now my day-to-day
then browsing the web is where it's shown it basically was allowed to
if so leave a like and don't forget to subscribe then guys for watching
this is going to be me logging on
he sent it over in exchange for reviews over the past week
I highly recommend getting on with the screen if you can afford it anyhow
Pro has brought to the market specs wise
that lifts a tablet 20 degrees off of any surface on paper
let's see how my week went with this tablet
had no issues with it really one thing
I'm not really keen on putting to use but for what it is
they work as they're supposed to nothing really to mention here
because you can set up your own macros
I can't say the same however for the stand like I mentioned earlier
but my back and my neck hurt when
I'm trying to use this device at this angle
moving on to the setup of this tablet
that go into your computer and finally you power
I can say with the clean conscience that I recommend buying this tablet
my hope is that this review helped you to make a decision
it be this one or another one my hope that
I could help you out by just sharing my experience
also a huge thank you to XP Penn for sending this thing over
I look forward to doing more reviews like this one in the future
disclaimer this product was provided to the author to do a review
not those alone to have your product reviewed visit bit that lease
from red water came here today to talk about the 27-inch kids tablet
it is while it's turning on it is none okay
is the cute little loading screen but you get the gist
and even when the tablet is on silent that still goes on and
just turn it on before you need to do that
um overall using it it was it's great to use
I have elected to use it for myself um you know I mean
I've played with a few other tablets made for kids before
sometimes they're a little laggy because it's not like they're very hydrate
Ablett's but this one does keep up and it holds
its own even with all of the fun games on it oh
I'll go over the apps in one second let me
just the last thing is that the battery life is about
I don't know I don't know if it was just like a weird lit
sorry you can see my decorations help over there
accordingly some other ones are ABC world basically learning your ABCs
geometry - it came with which is a fun kids
there's no kid stand or anything that it comes with but it does
it's easy to hold this grip you know like even if
it's not it doesn't slide very easily and like
you can just simply take it off and just you know
you have to do all this complicated steps to get out of the child
I was locking myself out of all the other apps that it works
it's a good good option and good safety
so that's pretty much it link to it below
hey do you want to review one of our products
the tablet itself the stylus pen the cord for it
that's actually the first time i've ever seen that
they threw in a glove and of course it came with the tips
don't worry if it looks like i'm struggling
i will say that something i like about
this tablet is just how wide it is
well the price of this tablet is 75 bucks so you know
it's not the cheapest tablet but here's the thing
it saddens me but at the same time makes me glad
what else can you really explore in short tablet's pretty good
oh wait i have one more thing to say about this
gamers thank you very much to galamond you
Oh tip 2 that I received full review from mom central and VTech
I'm showing the cheek today while my little guys in preschool
gasps oh my purchased a few already the unit
you can used to put the oil co gram
it'll stay up by itself and you can use it horizontally or vertically
so let's um put his programs just give you a quick overview
hello hello how would you like to play
George an icon to get started so you can either go to the cartridge
um ereader games art studio the camera like left
alright look at the video recorder it notes
he loves the camera and the camera left
I think that's his favorite thing to do
hello so you can little dark in here but yeah so this
aye so he thinks that's pretty cute so then you can
so you can go to your home screen then and take a picture
there's the art studio and you can you do it by hand
you can use your hand or you can use the stylus
and he's just learning so much and the mp3 player
I'm going to be downloading some music from him
I want to just tell you this is perfect and little girls
I mean that's really cute so this is for home
and the mobi go-to that's in the diaper bag
that goes with this on the go so yeah love it love it
central perfect gift can't say it for the birthday
and this could be the perfect gift for your child
hello nick here from technovo and welcome back to the channel today
it's the pebble gear frozen to a tablet
which has been specifically designed just for kids before we get into it though
2. the tablet features a seven inch touchscreen display
my daughter smashed an ipad before which wasn't great for anyone with this tablet
you get a thick rubber case which protects the tablet from bumps and falls
and if you dropped it on a flat surface like your floor
if the screen got caught on a sharp corner a table
perhaps then there could be damage behind the bumper
it's nothing special in appearance but the bumper case is nice
it's okay and it's priced to reflect that
the shortest duration to play can be set to five minutes
which apps have been used and when etc which is quite helpful
an eight-year-old spends 500 pounds on gold or gems
our apps are available too as i thought they may be unknown rubbish games
the other feature being an e-reader works well too
we sat there and read a number of stories together with bright colorful pictures
hey guys what's going on it's on here from
we're gonna be checking out this little tiny 7 inch laptop or tablet
I want to thank pika girl for sending me over this review unit
they actually have a campaign going on right now which
I'm at 150 which gives me a little bit more
desktop real estate back another thing you might have noticed
it's got almost like a full keyboard that you could type from
why they say it might be a tablet
this guy is about a cup of coffee
it offers to mic ports on the top and speaker ports in front which
like you put on a better or something like that or your lap
it won't even take it only takes up to three amps
you actually have a little slot here that you can stick in your
because the mouse left/right click is right there
it just works even though you might think
it's made for stuff like this so it actually works really well like
it's not hard at all once you get used to it what
I did find a problem was with the right-click it's I mean
this guy has no fans it is virtually quiet the heat you could see
I really like about this guy I gotta say I loved it
this thing works really well in those conditions especially loading up
I would do to type in IP addresses or typing
it is very very useful a couple of features that
I'm no stranger to this CPU and also like mini laptops
this is the GDP win and also the GDP win -
so it's a give or take on those situations
can i play any games on this anything that's 2011 and before probably but
I don't think you would really want to play games on this guy anyway
this screen is gorgeous compared to all the other ones
probably not if you're more towards traveling yours
you need to check emails all the time
and you're not really too stressed out about like playing games or anything
a news channel consider subscribing and also hitting that Bell notification icon
XP pen artist 12 pen display a cute little entry-level drawing tablet
I really wasn't taking it all that seriously
this is the smallest screen display of this kind
I was in no way surprised by this fourth price point
there's even a touch slider in the middle of those express keys
it has a little slide bar like this
it's not quite as sensitive as some of the other touch pads
I wish it was a little more sensitive also
the default mapping on the brushes at least is backwards for example swiping down
what's that you want me to tell them
which makes it a little easier to move around
it's their standard stand that they tend to send out with these drawing displays
it also doesn't come with the tablet itself
I am using Photoshop and I do not have the stroke straightener on
sensitivity also has a clickable button along this side it's customizable and also indented
that's just not something you see much on non
yes I googled the word hexagonal for this review
straight angled lines look good when drawn by hand
they look better when you draw them with the ruler
I also found that drawing really lightly with it produces a line
it's got a very good initial activation rate holding pressure
I did nothing here as soon as I installed it
I drew my first line and I got excited because it felt so good
pretty quickly kind of reminded me of drawing on the iPad
so what are the cons of a device like this like
that's the difference between where your pen tip is
I said before that could be more responsive and the other thing would be
is this some folks looking for hotspots on their displays
thank you guys for watching and I'll see you in a couple of days
first of all i want to apologize my last video
i have said that the uh the glomber pearl arcade stick was 190
i wanted to clarify that because i made an error in my last video
yeah so i found out that it was at your local walmart
i'm talking about the latest news reviews and previews and tips
here's the killer part you want to know
the spectacular part about this particular magazine is free
yeah no cost to you in the electronics department in walmart at the desk
just you'll see them when you get up there
if you guys out there remember what i said
there will be no display and actual demonstration of how the product works
we're going to go over that you know and that's about it
we've probably uh drawn an anime picture of uh ri uncle from killakil
oh my god look at this thing man
let's see what we gonna get in this
so you guys can better see and i can see what's going on
maybe i should have come on that side but this thing is crazy
oh there we go you see that okay
let's let's ease that down slowly ladies and gentlemen feel me
ah okay dog here we go damn okay man
i can already tell you this is good
this is great in fact this is great
so y'all can see i'll get this out of here this way
damn i'm to put this right here for now
okay oh look at that look at that look at that
so let's put this down and let's move this
let's move this out the way it's over here somewhere
i guess this was in here like this
yeah i'd agree i would say that was i would say that was great
this is a art canvas electronic art canvas
this thing was a thousand dollars when it first came out
how else will we know how to operate
okay here we go thank you for choosing here
uh oh my god that look animate on the camera man
okay and look i think let me see
oh this is just telling you what it already does man
i'm going to get this from your body
this is a good clock yeah to to wipe your swing off
are y'all seeing that it's got buttons on both sides
you know so i'll get set and adjust your colors
pause erase all that color palette buttons and look
let's see oh my god look at that screen anyway
good thinking on your own stuff check out that you got some buttons
let me bring this in a little closer
you got some buttons on it up here
okay and look we got this thing in the back let me put
it'll stand by itself so you can draw on it
we got that part out of the way
this is the 20 inch by the way this is the 28
when it first came out i think 9.99
let's get back to the pen and check this pin
i don't know if you can back order these if you
oh look at that look at the pants
oh man oh it's got two buttons on it
i figure one is for line and one is for erase
so i'm thinking yeah it's a great deal
but a sensor probably for the heron itself
i've been dying quality for the last three or four years
come on maybe i should lay that on the screen
okay and we're gonna have this thing put all together
we got the screws to screw that device
and screw this into the back of that and i think this lifts up
oh that's how i just helped so we flipped this over the back side
you can use it as a second monitor if you want to however
hey okay let's see what else is in the box
oh my god oh you know what this is for duh
oh my god we got another chord in here too
that's crazy yeah we don't you got to go
you don't even have to go do that
they see you give you one and i like that man
i like that because some people don't give you nothing to do
i've seen people draw stuff on here that beyond you know you
i know we got some screws somewhere but i wasn't seeing them
we're going to do a bonus video out here
they also have a retro arcade in the building
you know but sometimes you want to get it in head to head
so that's gonna be it for this unboxing when we come back
I won't be talking to you about the cameras in this video
we're not going to talk about that anymore
the place where they've saved a lot of money is normally on the screen
normally you buy maybe one of these larger tablets from Amazon or Ebay
so let's just take a look in the app drawer
so that's a little bit of a disappointment
I'm not sure how well this will be supported for future upgrades
I really appreciated that what I've really enjoyed though is watching back some videos
and that's purely because the screen is a really nice or color
something also noticed is why holding the tablet
we also got microSD card slots you can expand the memory
I think that they've done a really good job on this
it does also click dust a little bit more
let's just take one more look at the screen
just how much of a bargain this is
Titan 2 if you're looking for a really large screen Google Android tablet
I really do appreciate it as always if you liked the video
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you in another video very soon
This is the Vankyo MatrixPad S20, and the MatrixPad S21.
So what’s the difference, and why is the S21 priced lower than the S20?
and which tablet may be right for you.
So let’s now have a look at their design, button placement, and ports.
Both models come with a front facing 5MP camera.
Both models come with 32GB of internal storage, and Bluetooth 5.0 support.
which means it can run a 64 bit applications.
Both models have dual band AC 2.4 + 5 GHz Wi-Fi support.
So that’s it for system and hardware information.
Let’s now compare the Antutu benchmark scores of both models.
So the S20 outperforming the S 21 x 1200 points.
I will now test the responsiveness of both models.
It’s the official version with Chromecast, and here you can see
I have the same video open on both tablets.
Here is some sample footage from both models using their rear facing 8MP cameras.
The S21 however is slightly larger than the S20 and cost much less.
So if you’re on a budget the S21 might be the right choice.
And if you’re looking for a budget tablet with slightly better performance and hardware
So have come to the end of my review.
Thanks goes out the Vankyo for sending these two tablets for review.
Links to both models can be found in the description directly below this video.
Stay tuned and I’ll be seeing you in the next one.
so um if i sound a little bit awkward
it's because i don't know what i'm doing today
i originally wanted to have a danganronpa speedpaint in between them
it's because i'm currently in the process of unexpectedly moving
let's get into the actual unboxing and review
i'll also put a screenshot of them as well
as a screenshot of the items you can expect to find inside
this tablet is a lot smaller than i'm used to
it's only 11.6 inches diagonally so it was an adjustment for me
the tablet came with a shiny film over it to protect the screen
the tablet also came with the user manual and the glove
the tablet has eight express keys for shortcuts
i really didn't have any issues with setup
the cords are long enough to be flexible with where they went
there are buttons on the side of the tablet to adjust brightness and color
i believe and the auto button is used to go back in the menu
unfortunately the contrast on this tablet isn't the best
about the tablet overall who is blasting their base outside
you'll get a 15 discount on their already marked on price
this would bring the tablet down to about 173 usd
i'll include links to the amazon listing in the description
there is some parallax as you can see here
the cursor doesn't quite line up with a pen nib
the tablet doesn't seem to support tilt either
when i tilt the pen the cursor moves very far away from the nip
i think this tablet is a great option for beginners on a budget
it can be used both as a flat pen
i don't have to move my hand as much to make larger strokes
uh hopefully i'll see you next time with a speed paint bye
use the pen itself is lightweight and very cylindrical
initially whoa basically you just press the button
um i forgot what i was in the middle of saying
right foreign blue camera a i-66 so i thought 64 security foreign like home
okay come on hello okay my okay yet
hello everyone its Laurie and welcome back to a new video today
I'm doing a review of the XP pants RG 968 tablet
this tablet has got a surface of 8.30 5x5 point 33 inches
at the tablet it has got four customizable
this is just smart phones and tablets which is also pretty cool
which will show you different features of your pen
and your tablet you can customize the four
and it's such a hassle but it's fine
I actually did another sketch of this drawing
it was the first sketch but I really didn't like how it turned out
just didn't have a lot of like flow and movement
I did struggle a bit this destroying not with the girl I really like
she turned out the whole concept about her hair
I don't know and another thing that I struggled
which was the biggest struggle was the background
I had no idea what to do with the background
I just kept it as how it was originally
that's the only thing that bothers me about this drawing
let me know what you guys think about
the background should have done a different or should
I yeah or does it look fine how I left it
is that when you connect your tablet to your computer or laptop
it will blink a small white light which is on top of the 4x
press key a few times to know that the tablet is on
I really really like how this tablet works
it's really as big as my laptop keyboard
I really like the small size of this one
oh no my pen is gonna die then
I really like the fact about this pen
I use pencils every day at school or when I draw traditionally so
I don't know why I'm struggling with this one
I mean the tablet works but the cable is broken
it makes like it has a little problem connection
I don't know and my pen is also broken
it has everything that you need and it's very easy to install
it was my first time doing a review of a tablet so
and if you have any suggestions on how
let me know in the comments down below
I would love to know that but yeah
I really hope you all enjoyed watching this video
thank you all so much for watching once again
I love you and I'll see you all next time bye
that is sort of a drawing of a seashell
we have a lot of different options over to the side including our library
the books reader which is built in is actually pretty good
it's also your notebook so as you can see it has pressure sensitivity
what you think about the books nova 3
it is the number one choice for EMS professionals
it's also lightweight and portable weighing only 3.9 pounds
book arts hard drive heaters so protected keyboard and protected
CF 20 comes standard with a 10.1 inch anti-reflux anti-glare Full HD screen
it also comes standard with glove multi-touch capability this means
but if you need more you can get a digitizer as an option
the primary battery can be found in the tablet
Intel Core M 5 processor has a full eight gigabytes of RAM
Drive heaters on the new fully rugged CF 20 all ports are protected
connectivity it does have an option for 4G LTE or dedicated GPS
what's going on guy is the CTA Prime back here again today
CPU GPU and ram but with the 10 inch
we get more screen real estate so if you need a bigger tablet
I would opt in for the 10 inch version inside of the box
all of the ports and buttons are on the upper side of the tablet
I think the closest competitors to these tablets are the Amazon fire branded tablets
and right here we have an Amazon 10
plus the dual speakers built into the fire
and then we're gonna move into some benchmarks some native
HD 8 the GPU is a Mallee t7 20 MP
both cameras are absolute garbage like on most tablets
it's gonna open up all of the apps that are pre-installed
I am connected to my 5 gigahertz home network my home
moving over to some GPU benchmarks with 3dmark sling shot all of these
tablets are on the lower end of the android spectrum
it's not as bad as I thought it would be
it holds it fine if you're interested in picking one of these controllers up
I will leave a link in the description to Amazon
I also tested out grand theft auto san andreas and they both run great
I'm streaming project cars too from my main gaming PC
I got the settings maxed out here using the eye peg of 98 e3
it brings me back into the steam interface
not all games are gonna work great but well optimized games well like rampage
mario kart mario 64 i did test goldeneye at the lowest resolution
that just aren't gonna work well on this hardware
but if you want to go with some old stuff like sega genesis
Advance even d/s using drastic from the Google
version is only 15 dollars more than the 8 inch version
you get much more screen here and performance is going to be the same
maybe subscribe to the channel but like always
I'm gonna be doing a review of the huion
if you want to improve your art so basically
you also get a little wipe you get this
it is which makes it a lot easier to draw on so
next up we have the M 106 k the professional graphics tablet
ooh this one is marked at 60 799
ten by six point two five inches area five thousand eighty
so make sure to take that off before you draw this
this little nice pouch contains the extra nibs
QuickStart guide and the website for the drivers download
there's a new interface for the tablet settings in this tab
we have the stylus pen settings my pressure sensitivity is at zero right now
and you could program the two buttons here right button
cam can be pretty much any key or any mouse button right now
I'm not really gonna change that right now
I mentioned that there were twelve additional buttons there
II and my shortcuts are e4 erase and B for brush
change to the erase tool and I'm gonna tap the one
if you go to the work area tab this will be similar to what
I mentioned in the s 56k with a full area in screen ratio
I'll draw something a little different so what I really like to do
in my animations is draw those really like detailed faces
I guess kind of reminds me of those
I'm drawing at and instead looking at a screen while I draw is pretty
uh it's kind of like reverting back because that is how
let's make my lips a little bit of color you know
I definitely feel way more accurate with with this pen or with this tablet
yeah that'll definitely make me look pretty tired pretty much as outlined these
I think these are what people call the panda eyes
I've seen some in my life that look of I've been through some stuff
make these lips stick out a bit more perfectionist
alright that's yes okay turned out really good
I should use his face in the future animation
the name of the more professional drawing tablet
like the s 56k but it fits easy in a bag
it's it's a little bit smaller than the syntek
it's still fitting in my backpack with like a laptop and whatever
I've only drawn with this for about a week
little shot trouble shot troubleshooted and their customer service is really great
so if you have any problems you can just bring it up to them
this is definitely comparable to the different brands of this size
I personally haven't tried the Wacom Intuos or a lot of the different ones
there's actually just so many competitive brands now which is great
they're all pretty much kind of in the same boat
there's just little things here and there that you might not like
maybe it's the texture of the tablet but definitely
it's a thin and light machine that has an Intel Core
and that's for the power adapter speaker and volume buttons and the power button
the most unusual feature of this device yet is the keyboard
but you often wind up with these physical keys behind you here
so my my hands tend to hurt for long periods of typing
I'm not such a big fan of you can see
include a 2560 by 1440 pixels display and right now
so let's see what happens when we go to smaller you notice
you can see some benchmarks at little appearing com not the fastest system
these are the buttons for choosing your paint brushes and other settings and so
they might not look great now desktop apps
do look pretty good so you can see here
we're able to run two videos side by side
I've written a bunch of articles for lilliputian
I've done some other work on here and an overall performance wise
it gets around six to seven hours of battery life
make sure to carry the charger with you
it's not quite cell phone charged or compact
well the keyboards not so much of an issue
you can sometimes find it on sale for under 1200
I'd say especially when you consider that tablets
I mean it's nice to have these tablet functions
I don't even know what I'm trying to show you here
I'm sort of holding it on the table
I feel like it makes more sense to think of it as a laptop
that happens to work as a tablet when you occasionally wanted to
you can find more details that little appearing calm
10 is made of smooth black plastic with rounded corners
the top lip accommodates the camera in the micro sd slot to the left
the max 10 is slightly heavier than most expensive tablets
but you don't really notice the 926 grams of weight
open a plastic flap to reveal the micro sd card reader for additional storage
at the bottom is where the speakers are positioned wireless
that supports 802.11 ac it also has gps built-in and bluetooth 4.2
it's a similar experience to something you find on a budget smartphone
at least there's a headphone jack or bluetooth to plug in your favorite earpiece
the max10 has a front 5 megapixel camera and an 8 megapixel rear camera
this is where the tablet shows its budget
status photos from either cameras are washed out or too dark
the front camera is rated at 480p and the rear camera is 720p
and it is now a year later at the time of this review
i didn't find any performance or heat issues with playing any game in general
most people will find the battery life on the max
10 to be more than acceptable during testing with general
it didn't come with fast charging stock android
a pleasant surprise is the clean stock android 9
the images come out washed down and color
the performance is good enough to play most games on the play store
i wouldn't touch the camera except to call your friends
build if you don't want to pay extra for these features
hope you guys enjoyed the review of the dragon
let's see what 60 bucks can really do stick around welcome back to
so let's dig in a little bit first off
there's no need for an unboxing you get the tablet
touch logo looks like this could possibly be speaker and up top
this is a micro SD card slot for up to 128 gigabytes
get used to it play with it a bit
there's no blow where that means a lot to me
pi so just to give you an idea about some of the hardware
it's a quad core so 1.5 times 4 got 2 gigabytes of ram ddr3
this is actually a pretty good little tablet
so the breakdown of the m7 hand or tablet all right
you're not even gonna want to use it
I already did it so I'll just show you
that's really low for those of you that know what all these numbers mean
your score is better than 13% of the results from all other devices
I do have to admit it runs cool
Celsius frames per second 1 to 18 just for reference
Amazon music works great Amazon Kindle for e-books works great
the sound is a bit weird on this device like Samba
on some apps you can barely hear what's going on in on other ones
I think they could have added a couple watts
you do have to you know you have to pace yourself
Hulu actually runs a really nice on this machine
it's already started and last but not least
that's not a really fast tablet but it gets the job done sorry
I cannot get the ISO to look really nice but did the best
I could so about all that you know it
Google and get the Play Store and that's pretty much it
I was curious about the graphics on this
yeah you gotta love the soundtrack on his game too
I used to play this on the seal than that
I don't know seems like a pretty good deal pretty solid
I have a couple dragon touch devices and they've done me well
I got the I think it's called the k10
i'm jason howell and i am here with the samsung galaxy tab 3 8.0
and you can kind of tell if you're a samsung fan at all
language is very very close to each other
be it the phones as well as the tablets they all look very similar
LCD screen that I told you about its 1280 x 800 resolution
so it's not necessarily a full 1080p display
although there is a 32 gig model microSD card slot
megapixels 4450 milliamp hour battery inside that is non-removable
which kind of give it a nice little pop still a menu
button a capacitive menu button on the device
it would pull down fine it just really
the camera is almost not even really worth talking about and cameras on tablets
rarely ever amount to much but on here you get what
you know pretty washed out photos unless you're an excellent punchy light
it's probably best suited for video conferencing battery
the battery didn't really run out on me although
it timeout settings are there is no gesture support on here
you're probably going to like this device for everyone else
right hey comes with a keyboard which is absolutely brilliant
lots of things on this tablet great with the keyboard
so you've got like a little portable computer if you need it
because there's you know parental controls on there
unfortunately uh magnetic charging was not a thing when this tablet came out
so i'll just um just open it up so i can show you guys
but um just wanted to to show you guys
this uh detachable keyboard as well um so the trackpad is really good quality
which only has a 1080p resolution but goes much brighter
uh oh sorry 3k version um the reason
the resolution is a little bit odd 3000 by 2000
um is because it's it's not a 16 by nine um aspect ratio panel
it's actually uh slightly um slightly different slightly taller
um you can see that it's actually really thin
it seems to be um quite a uh i guess
and that's why i think a lot of people don't know about it
and right which is just just there volume up and down standard headphone jack
there always good the keyboard connector on the bottom and on the right side
uh thunderbolt three uh compatible as well um on the back
this particular version is the spec out version
so it has a fingerprint reader as well
i prefer to use it flat to down on the desk like this
as far as as far as the tablet goes
i'm a little bit sad that hp hasn't refreshed this line
sometimes it's a little bit a little bit sluggish but it is
it is very thin very very thin laptop sometimes the fan comes on sometimes
it's a lot more expensive than the surface pro
um so that's how i've been operating lately
the only other thing i'll mention is is battery life so battery
life's been a little bit poor to be honest
um doesn't um certainly doesn't live up to expectations and um unfortunately yeah it
i do like the the back of the laptop
um it's um it it's all it's all metal and it feels
that's my review of the hp elite x2
g4 i'll be uh posting this shortly online
if you think any i should have done anything
now this tablet does come in two different versions
the original version has two gigabyte of ram
so here's the box and everything that was inside
this tablet actually comes with a two year warranty
just make sure you activate your warranty next
that shows you exactly how to work the max10 tablet
inside of here it runs off of android 9.0
pi and the screen display here is a ips full
but right now this model is actually on sale for 15 off
in the middle we have the 8 megapixel camera and in the middle
you have the dragon touch brand and that is pretty much it guys now
the body is supposedly made out of aluminum
you also have another camera built in into the front right here now
it changes the color of the screen that way it
hey google what day is it right now
the audio of this tablet is not the loudest so actually kind of quiet
i am not too good at games guys
i think i was playing this back in uh college
all right so that's pretty easy and okay
oh okay are you on my team or do i shoot you
where's everybody oh oh oh come on come on
this guy might shoot me so this guy's pretty sucks too
okay so that's call of duty and this is grand theft auto guys again
uh through the past over 10 years now
even it's been over 10 years now back in the days
there's some flower that's what it looks like on the tablet
that's what it looks like on my camera and again back to the tablet
now let me show you what the front camera look like
and that's what the book looked like with the front camera of the tablet
so again front camera is not the best camera in the world
but it's there if you want to use it again guys overall
i believe i have shown you pretty much everything that this tablet can do
new small and powerful deco mini 7 wireless
this is a new product from xp pen and the price is 59.9
he's a good friend of mine that sent me this product for review
let's flip over the box and look at the specs of the tablet
it has a 10 times 6.3 inches of active drawing area
alright a standard warranty card here and some standard installation instruction manual
let's take the tablet out and you can see that
it has a nice plastic cover to protect it
so it stays firm on the table while you're drawing
let's see what else is inside this box
thank you card and thanks xp pen and a quick guide note
that shows you how to use it with android
usually there are 10 in most other tablet but this is different
it's pretty small and light and you don't lose it
it is the same with my other deco series tablet
here's all the items we have in the box
hold it till it shows the blue light
7w if you are using a mac machine choose the mac version of installer
and if you are using the pc windows choose the windows installer
let's proceed to run some tasks with design softwares like photoshop
next i will proceed with the test in clip studio paint
i uses the ink brush to test it
it works great and we proceed with testing it on android
the small size graphic tablet works great with android devices
this is the mini piece of graphic tablet with full features
it is affordable at the price of 59.9 dollar
not only that it has a tilt function
thanks and until then i will see you next time bye
hi guys and welcome back to my channel today
I'm gonna give you guys my review of the Alba 7-inch tablet
if you haven't seen my unboxing video please check it out
I'll leave a link at the end of this video
so guys my first thing about this tablet is that
do the setup setup on this one was the screen
Nokia 1 plus smartphone that I brought to this channel
it kind of has that same feel on the screen now before
I usually do that but with this one
I'm not gonna do that because the cameras are really poor
the cameras are not good at all the front camera
you shouldn't be doing that the other thing on this screen
let me let me try and show you
how apps for my daughter to learn and I've got Netflix YouTube
not many apps as you can see about five or five apps so
I'm not really putting too much on this one
they're not great at all and you know
I think it's great and I think this is a great
I think it is great now in terms of sound
I think that the speaker is really poor
it is a backfiring speaker right here at the bottom of the device
I guess I'll show you a sample in a bit
the screen is not great also but then again the price of fifty pounds
it's not great but it does the job the less okay storage
so you can't go above that but you know nevertheless fifty pounds again
let's check the speakers so yeah as you can see
the speaker is not great and most of the times
if you're holding it like this you end up blocking it with your hand
I think the software is good to have Android
you get you get the option on this one and that's it
I mean I wish I could get more with this
I wish I could get a USBC 1080p display
i already unboxed it but just to show the youtube video here
the actual tab is on the on the right side
finish with the milagro tag here and on the other side
um storage capacity is usable 0.98 gb and nand flash is 13.64 gb
okay uh it has couple of sensors here uh listed out accelerometer ambient feature
let's look at the other specification of the tab
i can't see anything from the side view
now let's took uh let's play a game here
why city here it is vice city game
it's taking couple of minutes to load and the screenshot okay
so how is the sound quality sound quality actually
hmm okay we have the quadrant benchmarks here
the company says it has hd recorder but it doesn't actually run on hd
so what is the resolution of picture taken because you just verify that
sibel hi everybody and welcome back to the channel
a review of the zenpad z10 connected tablet
because it'll work at home or on the go this is
3.0 break here for us bug of course from bra for masseuse
we have the instruction manuals as well as a sim removal tool and
we have a nine point seven inch 2k display
we have a back button a home button as well as a recent app
the sim ejector tool out of the box
we have a microphone and the antenna band all the way at the bottom
and you'll notice that the color representation here are slightly different
I personally like to keep it as vivid
that's the color set levels that I like again as I mentioned
SD card that I mentioned to you guys
I only get like barely two to three bars
Need for Speed Most Wanted as you guys saw
Most Wanted is by far one of my favorite games on any mobile device
do all the things that you normally do now
I was trying to watch a 4k video resolution the maximum
you're gonna be able to get this on
we're gonna be able to get and of course if
are going to be here very very nice
let's do a quick video audio sample for you overall
the one thing you want to be aware of obviously is the tablet itself
it's tuned to generate the sound on the right side
the sound will come more closer to you
now you do have a three and half millimeter
let's do a quick video sample on the camera
obviously the tablets are not intended to be used for cameras
I'll go ahead and switch over to the front-facing camera
so here's a quick sample of the front-facing camera on the ACS impact again
this is a five megapixel front facing sensor
let's say if you were doing a chat and you were using it
I don't think people like us to take pictures
this is mostly for videoconferencing and enjoying content
as far as the skin that we're running here this is called
Zen UI and Zen UI is essentially a Seuss's skin over Android 7.0
and then you can expand that application management
I guess II for email C for camera
I guess we have two different ones for camera
show a clock widget weather information and quick access applications
you can change those as well next thing
snappy it's actually not bad overall for what you get
you're gonna be able to enjoy most content on the say Netflix
I don't know if there's going to be an update to Android 8
but you definitely have the full power of the LTE connection here
and you're pretty much stuck to your local media with this tablet
this is actually pretty fast and it really taps into the full
it has a built in 78 million battery
I'm not sure if I mentioned that to you guys
so it's gotta last you for a long long time enough horsepower to power
I'll see you guys in the next video
it has a starting price of just about $300
it's been a lot less powerful than more expensive chips
but it's much more powerful than it used to be
so for instance when we're looking at desktop mode here
so if you're listening to music for instance that will keep playing over here
and then there's a headphone jack and that's about it
the microUSB port you'll notice here is the only port
adapter if you want to charge relatively quickly
you're not going to be able to charge it at the same time now
it does support miracast wireless displays so you can hook up a keyboard
the keyboard pops up automatically when you're running in desktop mode
what you do have is support for a digital pen
it'll hover if you were going to web pages they have drop-down menus
you can do that if you wanted to
let's go ahead and try to write something now
my favorite accessory is the $40 folio case
I'm just trying to get a better view here
it gets closer to nine hours of battery life
maybe and doing some thumb typing so powerful device inexpensive device decent battery life
it's definitely also not the best device for everybody
hey there's all new merch over at crowdmade.com talk secure
we should probably take a look at it
the first thing you notice about this tablet is that it's massive 21.5
it's going to connect to your computer with both hdmi and usb
you will also need an ac power outlet
the unique thing about this tablet is the matte finish
but that's more a matter of preference for me
the 178 degree stand is way above the previous tablet
lay it flat or have it stand up and act as a second screen
i didn't have to install the stand myself
the last one gaomon sent me pretty much sat untouched
i can comfortably make the transition to at the end of the day
that was probably a lot gentler than anticipated
it did get a few minor markings but it still works
check it out in the links below a huge
thank you to galman for sending me this tablet out of the three
hey everyone welcome to this review of the VK 15 drawing tablet
that was sent to me so this are all the things included
we have the pen pouch and the pen
we'll take a look at this closer later
one artists glove nip remover and replacement tips
they included a lot of extra tips so many that
this is the QuickStart guide or manual and on this card
the design is very nice and clean very straightforward
this is a single piece of drawing area
the indicator lights are just beside and there are 12 physical shortcut buttons
it feels very solid a bit plasticky and lightweight but solid to side buttons
here that you can customize to any keyboard shortcut c1 or mouse functions
it's going to appear in system preferences right at the bottom
the driver functionality is essentially the same just that we
so this is where you can customize the pressure sensitivity of the pen
and this is where you can choose the laugh and the mode
let's take a look at what you can configure for the commercial cuts
the cursor will slow down so this gives you more control
I have the smoothing to 20% and the curves they are smoother
the pressure transition can be a bit abrupt so for example here when
I am transitioning from this thick line to the thin line
let me use the physical chaka button to change the size of the mouse
Adobe Illustrator on the Mac there is no pressure sensitivity by default
all back to within this is mini back
paint pearl pressure works fine here very responsive so
here has tried a strokes thinner thick transition
it works quite well here so no issues we have
this is clip studio paint on the Mac pressure sensitivity
then fake actually prefer to draw with this compared to using
let's try to thin a thick transition again so once again
I see some abrupt changes in thickness so here
so if there's going to be an issue in drawing well
I think it still works fine for drawing purposes
I actually don't draw a lot with Photoshop
it's quite responsive most of the desktop apps that
sensitivity doesn't work by default on clip studio paint
it doesn't work as well compared to other graphics software that
I have shown you in this video the price for this tablet
we're going to do an unboxing of huion hs 610 creative pen tablet
so let's start run so so hello guys
welcome to my new youtube channel to my new studio so today
we have eight nibs so if it's broke you just can change it okay

i can't even listen to that anytime that i ran into somebody
just click in the link below in the description
so this is the software for you on tablet
so let's explain you about this software this smart software this huion tablet
so let's see what the software can do and let's start
okay the press keys is your controller of your tablet
we have six buttons up and six buttons down
this is the huion software pen so we see here on the pen
two buttons so this button is like the press keys and tablet
okay the workspace is for your comfort table
you can draw better and you have several options
we're gonna see how it's work in a graphics software
you can use you have a lot of options of graphics softwares
hey the beat go off bye um so do okay guys
so let's see you in the next video bye
hey guys and welcome to another episode of quick expert reviews today
Ivanka as a matrix part which reminds me a lot about the Van
obviously we've got the tablet and we've got the customer support leaflets
you've got which is always nice and then what let's have a look
there are overly many buttons that we wouldn't know
then we've got the standard charging cable which I believe is a microUSB
let's have a look if there is an actual SIM card slot in here
really the colors are really saturated not overly saturated and pretty decent
we've got a double tap on the power button to jump into the camera
we've got a digital wellbeing and parental controls
which is handled by obviously an Google Android works really well
it's it's there if you ever want to use it both
and but it's an actually nice saturated display
movies fingered lasted around like 16 to 18 hours watching when
thanks for watching another episode of quick expert reviews and
i'll be reviewing today is called the m106k pro
it's a mouthful and it currently costs 63.99 on amazon
this tablet works with windows and mac operating systems including android 6.0
i think it's a great bag to use
i never actually knew they were called nib clips
nib like a few times and so eight just feels like plenty though
i'll tell you how to set the tablet all that some
another thing in this bag is a drawing glove
ever since i got my screen tablet i cannot stop using them
last thing in the box is some otg adapters
and you don't want any of that after plugging the tablet into my laptop
i was after plugging the tablet into my laptop
it's not a big deal since you need to download the driver anyway
after installing the driver it was really easy
it's there but it's not the best it could be on the other hand
it just doesn't acknowledge that i'm using pen pressure at all on the client
i just used clip studio paint to test it instead and it worked fine
whenever i was undoing a lot it turns out
which is what i kind of was suspecting but i wasn't a hundred percent
so thank you for not having that glitch
this tablet also works very well with fire alpaca
today we are sticking close to my roots
so they cater to events they cater to weddings and things like that
cheap and tablet is the sort of thing that's so wonderfully rich and sweet
you only ever really need kind of one piece at a time
this lovely kind of teal color or the ribbon really excited to taste it
I know from Scotland who don't like chocolate
it's this lovely kind of golden brown color and up close
we're told look my finger said that's how excited
I am for this so I have never tasted sterling tablet before
it's got a gorgeous natural rich burnt sugar flavor
I'm probably gonna eat five and piss off my dentist because it's so good
I'm not saying this because it's been sent to me that
and it's really worth trying especially if you're a sugar freak like me
thank you guys as always for watching if you enjoyed the video
so we're just going to jump into the unboxing now first thing
open the box and keep everything in the frame
okay so i like that has a little cushion
protect the monitor so here we have the design
if the towel does not turn on when you get it
wait for one three minutes initial start to enter instruction for for language sentence
now you can enjoy your tablet with following actions using your fingers
okay so do not forget to activate your warranty okay
put down our here so you can see here
let's move this so it does take a while to uh start okay
okay so i'm picking english and so then it asks you australia
currently i'm just showing everything that you do at the beginning
okay so after impend uh my email information so now
let's try to figure out where the oh that's quite loud
nope this is a little key up here
we're just trying to find the where we get all the information
here's all the apps that are included so we have a system calculator
okay chrome clock contacts dive duo files fm radio gmail
we have apps notifications so we have calendar
battery percentage in status bar last full charge nine days ago
okay display you can change the wallpaper brightness
now yeah the dark theme be hard to see schedule power on off
so everything's turned off and i'm gonna reduce that that's a loud
yes turn a little bit lower not too fond of loud noises
we have the privacy permission manager show password lock screen
let's see uh location security accounts accessibility screen reader and stuff like that
they have to check tablet digital well-being and parental controls
so that's pretty much everything that's included in the actual device
we'll do the video test the photo test um audio
you're always going to want to play more and more and more
and plus they're also coming off the expansion as well to mention that so
that's gonna you know help the replay value but even with the expansion
echoes a little and so but the resolution is perfect
we're just going to see and test if the game i downloaded works well
on this day the empire came to bring chaos pain and death
they want to plunder everything in the galaxy to protect our home
we can only risk as you can tell
this is trying to get into the game play
i'm gonna do some video through the the camera
so this is a great tablet so far very impressed android
and you know uh tablets which i would advise pen
i'm just thinking that because i you know
is that the tablet offers where you could insert sd card
a lot of people said it didn't work
so that's one thing i really liked about the tablet um pretty much
um the manual i would say the manual
what position like simple things that should be
i just wish that the i'll show here the sd slot
you know so i just you know these tablets
they don't they're not meant to last long probably two to like five years
um you could see me uh you know using my fingers everything
if you like this video please click like and subscribe
the tablet is packed in this white box
we'll see the ant sleep paths on the upside down
the pad has rubber bases rounded and it has a weight
and it's very pleasing to hold this in your hand also
don't forget to create all your own softwares and antivirus programs done pressure test
i know we can actually pull the walking area upside down for left handers
i just got to use to draw like this
you can change the settings as you want of course
in addition to these buttons the table had 16 expressions on the top
which you touch with pen so here attaches the four keys
it has large working area that is good to drown it as an artist
if you don't have many money goodbye see you soon
so were you looking for me or just really for my estate
so why don't you go get just say cheap
i wasn't maybe you could see the sunset i stare into each other's eyes
how about that four kings game and if the city never sleeps
it actually looks like a decent deal inside of the box
we have our volume rocker power button and a pinhole microphone on the top
but we do have that 2 megapixel camera and the cutout for our speaker
it's gonna have the same CPU and GPU built in
it's just a little more vibrant and it gets a bit brighter
we'll do a quick rundown on the specs here and then
we have an 8 inch 1280 by 800
I was kind of impressed when I pulled it
so you can pick up that five gigahertz network
let's go ahead and get into some testing
it's actually pretty snappy and down here there is this little
I've been using Pluto TV a lot lately and it works
ET 720 MP two GPU and for the operating system Android 9.0
Pi there was a couple updates when I first booted this up right now
higher is better at the very top we have the on 8
Walmart tablet with a 574 at the bottom fire eight HD with a 585
the on tablet scored a 1741 in the fire eight HD 17 57 now
GPU intensive the on eight actually beat out the fire eight HD
Android devices I also went through my house and tested Wi-Fi speed
and you'll see that in just a second
I'm not a big mobile gamer so I just went to the Google Play
on this device there are some n64 games
Genesis 32 acts Game Boy Game Boy Color Game Boy
those are kind of out of the question and finally
I'll just give Netflix a quick test here
Pluto TV and Kodi if you want to install a Kodi build
it's totally possible on a tablet like this and it works very well
you can watch whatever you want on these things
I mean it's a decent tablet for the price
the biggest difference between the two tablets is this 64 dollar tablet runs
this is actually cheaper when the fire eight
so that's pretty much it for this video guys
it's actually a decent tablet for the 64 dollar price tag
I got the gray one so let's have a gander at the HS 611
this is what you get inside the box
the active area gives you plenty of room to draw though
actually this is pretty much identical to the huion canvas
Pro 16 depends quite difficult to knock over but the the hs6 11 well
I didn't need to install any drivers it which was neat
I recognized straight away but there is one glaring problem as you can see
we are doodling away and yet the pen
Pro 16 panels and since it's a graphics tablet
there's no need to worry about screen accuracy at all since you know
trying to control the pressure on this pen
I don't find that as useful the touch bar
it's it's far too sensitive and it's it's just inaccurate for me
yeah not a fan of the touch stuff not really
I find it gets it more in the way than it's actually useful
the yeah the main novelty and selling point of this tablet is its portability
it is pretty small as you can see in the video there
so you couldn't say while you're drawing like the programs
it's it's okay all right and here animate does what it does
best the crashes and corrupts everything so cool never change animate
even though it's as light as a light thing it's incredibly light
the pen feels a little cheaper in the materials
but it's still fine still works the stand however or man that stand
it's not bad tablet performance since this is just a graphics tablet
there are lot less things to go wrong like
we've got plenty of Express keys the multimedia keys
the bio is too sensitive in and accurate for my own pen performance
the pen worked well for the most part though
five out of five million customization is great for the size of the tablet
there's nothing else I can really say about it
so yeah four out of five for that
so value of this tablet is pretty great
values a five out of five from me and tallying up the totals
then this gives the hs6 11 a total score of 8 out of 10
I'd highly recommend it to novices or hobbyists
this could be the last one who knows goodbye goodbye
i will be posting an honest review on my youtube
hi guys anna here and welcome back to my channel today
we're doing a review of canvas 13 by huion
if you do that would be a little bit extra
that explains everything and how it's connected and where everything goes the wiping cloth
i receive like a small piece like this so i love this
so you have the power that's connects to your tablet
that's all you get in this box now
thanks so much guys it really means a lot to me
also leave a comment down below to let me know
it actually fell out when i was opening everything up
this is the tallest one that it goes
we can just put the pan here while we're working
i guess kind of just like go for it
you're good or you can use it as a usual pen holder
let's peel off this mask before application that is satisfaction right
you have the buttons on one of your sides
this one says connect to the power adapter and voila now
so setting up all of the drivers was super easy
the pressure sensitivity worked very well as well
we can test as much as we'd like but to be honest with you
i don't really have a lot of those
my work is more messy in a way so for me
um i can tell you that i felt very at ease working with it
so the most important ones and flip canvas as well overall
i just had a very nice experience with this tablet
it didn't work at first but then i adjusted something in the pen settings
it's just you can't go wrong with that
it was truly a pleasure working with it
it really does mean the world to me all your support
it was super fun to review this tablet
tilt, there is a scroll wheel, and it comes with a stand.
Now I haven’t tested the 16, but to me the 15.6
First thing in the box is the tablet itself.
The stand is next, part number AC 41 if you need a replacement.
Then pull the flap open more until it locks in place.
Twist open the pen capsule to get the pen.
This is a magic pen, no batteries, no USB charging.
that gets rid of the slippery, glossy feel of glass.
There is no up or down side on that cable
so plug it in whichever way its facing.
Last, plug the other USB cord and the HDMI cords into your computer.
If you have a MAC, use the white adaptor on the HDMI end.
Then you will see your missing windows and be able to drag them back.
If you have to uninstall something, restart your computer.
Download the correct driver - I’m using Windows.
click the desktop and go to Display Settings.
The first thing you want to do is click the Calibrate button.
If you feel like it’s still off, do it again until satisfied.
Express Keys is where you can program the shortcut buttons
Now when you press that button the scroll wheel switches to its next setting.
The other side of this window allows you to choose your pen
Once finished, it’s a good idea to save your settings with Export Configuration.
You can load saved settings with Import Configuration.
Once I got past that activation point the pressure sensitivity was great.
As you can see, no problems getting lots of line width variation.
Same as with other reasonably-priced tablets, there is a little bit of funkiness
on the way the line comes to a tip on fast strokes.
In SAI, when you switch to the eraser
This is because the pen still thinks its in eraser mode.
Boom - if eraser mode is active, none of your tools work.
Once in the middle of my testing session the tablet decided
it was going to map itself to the other monitor.
show only on X to get everything back.
The XP-Pen Artist 15.6 is the best non-Wacom screen tablet
You can see all of my tablet reviews at ScribbleKibble.com on the episodes page.
files and reference sheets are all available on my patreon
but as with all of my tablet reviews
you have the all-in-one a multi cable which keeps things simple
felt slipcover the Bosto tablet itself as well as the flat folding desk
it is worth mentioning but online and in some descriptions what
there should be a USB charger for the stylus pen
but this model is in fact battery free now
so this is what the boss toe 16
the front of the tablet has a very clean
look to it with all of those silvery
plastic buttons kept around the edge and a second layer underneath that screen
come across another tablet which has taken this particular design option for their buttons
and you will want to have it tilted up to comfortably
I did have to do a cheeky awkward
if it's going to be breaking your workflow now
it has four rubber grips on the underside
the shape does feel a little bit chunky and dated
onscreen for your line size or opacity instead of just a springy movement
I personally found an error telling me for the wind tab
now none of this was a fault of
you can also ensure that the palm rejection kicks in the moment
not quite the final at the time of making this video
small smooth tightly grouped buttons that you can't directly see
I did find myself using the undo button
the image itself was nice and sharp but even after some adjusting
now the pen itself has essentially no give in the nib
boster are one of the very few brands outside of
I don't think that it intends to either
I was actually pleasantly surprised with the Bosto 16 HD creative stylus display
so this is the tech last g30 now
let's take a look and see what all we get in the box
so here is the box that the tablet does come in
take a look at the link in the video description
the brightness is turned up to the maximum level right here
and it's not the brightest display ever but it's certainly not dim
so that will look really good and overall this big nice
we are getting a 5 megapixel front facing camera on the left side here
there's no right or wrong way to use it
SD card in the tablet and dramatically expand
now there is no wireless charging at this tablet
as you'd imagine there's also no fingerprint sensor or anything like that now
recording videos taking selfies doing different things like that
yeah so a pretty good speaker on here
now it's not necessarily the highest quality build ever
we have the microphone with a slot for the microSD card and SIM card
we have the USB C port for charging and data transfer
I think you're gonna be very satisfied in general with how everything works videos
so that's definitely very awesome and really for a tablet in this price range
I feel like this does over-deliver in both speaker quality and video quality
the tablet is also great for browsing the web
most mobile games will work on here now
there's really nothing about the tech last t30 that
today we have another special guest say hi to gyawan m12 20
yes but before we get to the tablet
give me a second to talk about my patreon
there you'll be able to get access to my animation process
sneak peeks and just other cool stuff link will be in description now
i really have no idea if i'm saying this right
i want to make this quick and simple
so let's see what we get in the box
tablet case tablet wires pens adapters pancakes this case
i don't know what it's for with nibs inside a glove instructions
if you click these two buttons you can undo and review pretty cool
only this will be probably more convenient for a left-handed person
let's head on over to my quotation marks computer from my last review
i learned that i should not use the old laptop
thanks mom and downloading drivers works really easy
that was pretty hard in my last review
and you just get everything you would get from a simple drawing tablet now
i don't remember if i mentioned in the video
but if you're drawing on an android device you can only draw vertically
i don't remember if everything was perfectly fine
so if you're looking for a drawing tablet i would i would recommend this
you have like express keys only one thing keep in mind express keys
Jerez and german welcome to draw with Jazza
I know you guys mock the way I say H instead of H well
so if you're looking for someone who has used it for years unfortunately
let's jump into the specs of this device
H 950 P tablet has a working area of eight point
I keep making mistakes as we'll get to in this review and new
install that and it's pretty straight forward like that seemingly
I'll get to why I'm being mysterious a bit later
the preferable way to have a pen input
I haven't needed to warm up to the use of a pad tablet
I can use a pad tablet where you look at the screen
this was the first time where that didn't need to happen
has this really nice sort of Sheen to it
it was immediately really comfortable which is great
one of which is the way you draw
sometimes people like to draw from the wrist
sometimes people like to draw from the elbow or the shoulder
it's almost like you're supposed to do that
because it's entirely built around that but really
I wanted to see how this thing worked in Photoshop
you need to have a double click in your drivers
I don't know why it's not there yet
it should be a really easy addition just to a driver
update put a double click in there for the love of God
please the workaround I currently use with Hurom
I do think it's there so it's not a con
it's it's a somewhere in the middle if you like it
I knew this would be a good device
I didn't expect this to be a device that actually blew me away
this thing is fantastic and I as a professional
I have talked through this video about it
this was a real pleasant surprise for me whether you're a beginner
who is looking for their entry into digital art and animation
I haven't sort of experienced then something so small and affordable yet especially considering
I hope this video has been useful to you if you have any questions
I'll be able to get to them and let you know my thoughts
I've reviewed today and a whole bunch more
there's another video you might enjoy from my channel over there
you can also check out my behind-the-scenes daily vlog channel daily
Jezza that's it for now and until next time I'll see you later
in and a tablet is generally considered as a great content consumption device
you can watch a lot of great movies on the large display
this tablet is a 10 inch tablet runs on Android
it won't slip out of your hands easily at the bottom
the overall build of the device is functional
the display has thick black borders all around
we've seen but the color reproduction looks good
even though the display was reflective we watch some
too daredevil season 2 episode 3 stachyose fight sequence looked good on the display
the display looks fine browsing websites and reading
however sunlight visibility of the display does suffer
the display of the tablet has a maximum lumens of 390
which means that you can make calls from it
the typing experience on the other hand is OK
typing in portrait mode is easy for me since
Beast run too many heavy apps on it and you will see a slowdown
the device lasted for a little over 5 hours
this is the a business centric tablet that
so taking a look at the side profile
this is still a very thin tablet here that we have from
on the left hand side you do have a lock button
I like the profiles thin but it still gives you a performance now
the keyboard itself is one of the areas that it will
Nova will be pushed forward especially matching the same keyboard
let's talk about the keyboard for a second
whatever the case may be and also using the stylus that comes with it
no but the thing had x1 tablet I definitely recommend it

Yeah, so this is the Wacom Cintiq 16.
And it just came out, brand new in January.
But I feel like Wacom is the most recognizable brand.
Which is kind of expensive, and a lot of people can't afford that.
If companies can organize well, then I am a happy customer.
We have our basic power cables and wires.
So, we're gonna take a minute real quick to set that up.
This is about the height that it goes at.
Which goes all the way up, like that.
That would be my preferred height, I think.
Right there. Just a quick info for you guys.
The screen size is fifteen point six inches.
This little thing in here is for your pen.
You plug that in, and you put your pen, and it holds your pen.
And this goes on the bottom of your Cintiq.
The most important thing I look for with tablets is the response rate.
Watch. To be absolutely honest, no technology is ever perfect
Every product is gonna have some sort of a small lag with response rate.
If I can get close to the one-to-one ratio, then I'm a satisfied customer.
And this one, it looks really really good so far.
I'm religiously working on my book Nima this year.
I just learned that there are extra nibs inside this thing.
What the heck, I didn't even know that.
So you put it in, then you tilt it.
I'm just gonna keep refining this real quick, and I'll check back soon.
Welcome back, and here's the progress of the piece of Sloan so far.
What is a Ross Draws video without some color dodge!?
I hope you enjoyed the new character from my book, Nima.
You can see the final piece on my social, at RossDraws.
Working on the new Cintiq was a lot of fun.
I worked on this in complete broad sunlight.
I've been having James stand right here as I film.
Oh my gosh! Thanks, James. Go back. MVP.
My only real complaint, is that the price of the stand is $80.
If you're on a budget that can be kind of pricey.
I think it's a fantastic option and you can't go wrong.
Just enter the code ROSSDRAWS when you checkout.
There's more info on all that in my description
But the good news is, we have a Cintiq 16 to give away.
This one, anyone can enter, anyone around the world
And rule number two, answer the question of the video.
If you were on a deserted island, what three things would you bring?
I'll also sign and draw on the box too, so good luck.
Don't forget to subscribe, and remember, every day is a color dodge day.
this will be my first tablet review and this tablet was sent by
Baumann and I'll really thank them for sending me
I already own busted because I want to install the tablet driver thing
Samia and Mohandas is Kate or drawing tablet and I'm going to repeat this
oh and also they should be a one tip clip
don't sue me come on so again now before
also this this is a working size of
and it's pretty large and the price of this is less than $100
I think it was like $30 but it's really good
it's really good compared to the other tablets and their prices
I want to do a review of this product
which i think is really worth your time
and it's not even like searchable on youtube yet
it's better than I thought and it's definitely a great upgrade
and it looks definitely crappy inside but anyway who cares
okay so this one is not a CD
and that's the smallest that came of it
it feels a little bit of like textured plastic
yeah but it doesn't feel very plastic to me anymore like
that doesn't need battery but I don't know what this hole is for
so don't be afraid like oh there's a hole
so the tablet is so this is the react a 15
hey it's just another tablet but no there's a big improvement here
okay now you can see because of the lighting okay
this surface is wider and narrower than those of the more traditional looking tablet
everything feels like one piece except right here
they did a much better job this time
and there's also a touch pad and this touch pad is not a trackpad
so that makes some sense to your brain okay
the thickness is very slim very lightweight compared to all the tablets
I don't even need my keyboard shortcuts at all okay
I don't even need the keyboard usually with the small tablet
if you have this you can also use this pen with this one
let me tell you if you buy a walk on
you can do it this way or the other way
three tablet of the same brand together at once
I have like three V a crane and I cannot always uninstall install
you know just to test right okay so this is really good
it return back to normal to Center the 100% view
the lowest two is always the undo and redo buttons
I think you can see it's very smooth
and the the the lines and stuff is very nice
so but this one doesn't have that problem so they definitely kind of tweak
which is the opposite of 10 bottom right hand side button
I can move around and I click this button for the brush again
always want to fill fill like this okay and then of course
the lowest two is undo and redo so
I find that it actually outperform my because the shortcuts
I will have an other video like really just drawing some art directly drawing
you're not talking but here I want to like just tell you okay
the overall experience after playing with this for a week or so
I'm telling you that out of my personal experience
the first favorite one it's a small one because I use it every day
just the thing is enough for my shortcuts
okay really like that little little curve right there okay
so that's it for the day and hope you liked the review
check out the link below to get yours
is it affordable all those questions and more will be answered
i get a lot of questions from you
guys asking about what tablets would be good to get and honestly
i haven't tried very many in my lifetime
i can give better answers to those questions for you guys now first off
that gives you all the information that you need to set up the tablet
the plugs needed to connect it to your computer some fancy hand pans
i mean look at this tiny little baby monitor
all i did was go to the gaomon
wasn't that comfortable of a drawing position for me
i have seen people hold theirs while they draw
but that's just not something that i would do
luckily i have a stand that i already use for my ipad
i didn't have to adjust it at all so i tested
but this didn't seem to really fix the issue
i think because i'm used to working a little larger
it was easy to use and set up and higher quality professional grade
i hope you enjoyed this little extra video and like i said
bye guys you wanna draw on the tablet
Artist 12 tablet to give my honest review with.
I thought today we could open this, see all the features.
Hey guys, so this is what XP-Pen gave me.
It looks really nice, clean, modern and also the stand.
Let's see what it looks like, right out of the box.
Hi. So this is what it looks like
These are different power adapters depending on where you live.
Whoa, it has a hexagon shape to it.
So you see that shine right here, and look what it does.
Kind of diffuses it, so that's the anti-glare film.
So we have this stand as well and let's see how this works.
Whoa! So there's this little knob right here where you can click and hold.
Yeah, so the stand is about forty to fifty dollars.
You buy these together, you save a bit of money.
So this is the piece I have for us today.
I thought we'd try to finish it and refine it and polish it.
Of course, let's put on our glove that came with the tablet.
Maybe her pet dragon could have a little tongue.
This is before what I did, and this is after.
And you can tell that there's a lot more detail.
That's the ultimate test that I love to do.
I'll probably finish this on my own time.
Sun-kissed at the beach with her pet dragon.
Milo, what do you think? Do you like it?
I hope you enjoyed watching me paint and playing with the features.
The XP-Pen Artist 12, I believe it retails for $250.
is the home tablet that I use and this is the Artist 12.
You know, I had to stop filming and try to figure everything out.
This is strictly a tablet and a second monitor
that caught me by surprise was how accurate the colors were.
Maybe it's an ice world with flying polar bears everywhere.
Of course if you want another chance to win head over to my Instagram.
I hope this review was helpful for you guys.
Good luck and remember, every day, is a color dodge day.
hi this is a review of the ug 2150
I've been scented by gearbest and all the links are in the description
a display tablet is slightly different to your drawing tablet
inch screen hence 2150 1920 by 1080 it cost 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity
so all the normal stuff you'd expect and it's actually a nice vivid monitor
so the most up-to-date driver that's kind of in beta since
I don't really find it much of a problem
I'm used to the Wacom which is a nicer comfier screen
that's not really a problem especially in the middle of the screen
you can see me doing a sketch here
very basic stuff pretty rubbish to be honest but you can see
there's a 19-inch one as well for 280 pounds which is fantastic
that's one thing it really has over the
which does make a difference to your workflow
okay hope there helps and write in the comments
today the share popularity of tablet is decreasing
it's also make some brands reduced or even in their tablet series protection
the weight is quite liked for a 10-inch tablets which is only 393 crumbs
the result is the screen display of the Xperia z4 tablet is very sharp
yes a lot of noise is still very visible
UI exactly the same as the Xperia smartphone
then it is also supported by front-facing stereo speaker
the score from the antutu benchmark is around 100 thousand
it is still long enough to feel until full
yes because of our activities from social media ill enjoying multimedia content
its performance is still quite responsive and smooth
it is still not ok for heavy gaming okay
that's all if you have any questions just read in the comments
don't forget to subscribe so you don't miss the latest video from this channel
I'm sorry for my bad english thank you
so this are the items included in the box
this is made with some thick felt like material
it's quite similar to my 15.6 inch laptop
except it's not that thick of course it's much thinner
the active drawing area is ten by six and a quarter inches
so you can slide it in like this
your wrist and there are 10 physical shortcut buttons on the side
sensitive scroll wheel here and in the middle of the screw wheel
there is a button a function switch and five at the bottom now
they can be customized to any keyboard shortcut and the button presses
i've just connected my tablet to this laptop which is running mac os
they are essentially similar except with the windows driver
you are not able to plot points on the pressure curve
brush if you want to assign your own specific keyboard shortcut
just click on any of the buttons and enter your shortcuts here
you can't just turn it around and insert it one issue
this drawing app that i'm using this is midi bank paint pro
um it's really good now with minibank paint pro
but now it's working fine again so i'm not sure what's wrong
that's the only issue i discovered during testing
the drawing texture here it's a matte surface texture
it's quite smooth with the pen but still provides a good enough control
it's not like slippery as if you're drawing on glass
i want them to so the line quality the line behavior
you can have tilt and pressure looking working together
this app that i'm using this is krita
the shape of the cursor will follow the direction of the pen
be like this where it's horizontal so that i can like this
so let me just draw this when i draw like this
you get this rectangle so if you turn the phone horizontally
it's going to be mapping vertical drawing area to a horizontal area
and now i have this samsung tablet connected to the gaomon tablet
now when i am drawing on the tablet this time i can see
it's mapping this horizontal working area to a vertical canvas
you can expect fantastic drawing performance drawing performance on android
the build quality of the tablet is relatively good compared to other brands
it's pretty good by the way right now
anyway you can check out more reviews for the gaomon m10k pro on amazon
i have links for you in the video description below
I got my hands on the new 2019
pen tablet for photo and video editing retouching illustration digital art or graphic design
during which time I haven't had any issues whatsoever
Express keys while the larger sizes all have eight of them
the vacuum prepend 2 is a battery free stylus which is charged electromagnetically
it's very comfortable and a very nice design
I also love the extra nibs hidden inside the pen
I never really felt like they are getting in the way while
the hand-eye coordination takes some time to get used to
Control lives up to my expectations of it being the highest quality pen tablet
it requires if you are looking for a cheaper but similar option
what would you like us to cover next time on this series
we're looking at the medium size graphics tablet.
Now these new Intuos 4 tablets have increased sensitivity
now there are eight express keys down the side here
Next to the next to the Express keys now they can be customized
We have a selection button and a rotation ring here
And you can create shortcuts on screens of various tools
You can rotate round to different tools within the photoshop application.
Which goes in like so on your desk?
And if you open up this holder it actually contains all of the different
nibs that [you] can use with the tablet now
The interest for tablet senses which nib you are using in the tablet
Which tell you what the express keys are doing
This has been my review of the Wacom intuos For graphics tablet
come back soon and check out more reviews on geek
it supports topped with an integrated pen that fits into the display
the app the Army's in here is fresh paint and as you can see
and it's quite responsive once you get used to
there's the 2 megapixel 1080p front face and webcam with a 5 megapixel
which i think is pretty standard there has HD audio of DTS sound
I'm using the power keyboard and it gets its name from its secondary battery
and on the right it has a second
that's all for now and thank you for watching
all the opinions you're about to hear are my own
I was expecting something all plastic and very cheap feeling with a lousy display
it's got a metal case on the back here
it feels rather solid and pretty nice in the hand
this is running with an atom sherry trail x5v 8300 processor
and because this was bought from the Microsoft Store this is a signature PC
I did find though when I took it out of the boxes
the updates for it took forever so plan accordingly
you just have your power switch and your volume rocker on the bottom
okay not fantastic but good enough for the price point on the top here
here is the fact that it doesn't have a second
I think you're going to get about seven hours
I think you'll get seven hours out of there without too many issues
the back camera is a 5 megapixel camera
it looks like there's a frost or something over the lens
I did a video on that a little while ago
you can see down below in the video description now
so you're not going to get any of the newer
lenovo mix 320 that one came in around 20
the margin of error here is about the same
just fine is installed just like any other
Logitech I bought this about two or three years ago
it's great especially for computers that lack ports
I can get an all-in-one keyboard trackpad combo here
that can connect up via bluetooth that also works with a dongle
one thing to note on the accessories you might buy for this
we're just about the same as the computer
this is running at about 15 to 20 frames per second
some of the newer indie titles of 2d games like shovel knight typically work
okay on here some do better than others
I looked at a couple of weeks ago
so that's a good thing it doesn't do as well with the higher-end
I think with the Amazon tablets that are about this price
so that's a good thing to have here battery
this channel is brought to you by my patreon supporters including gold-level supporter
there are many pen tablets out there in the market.
there is wacom and other lesser known brands.
I want to thank Huion India for sending me this tablet for review.
it didn't feel anything which is less than a premium packaging.
the box was very well designed and built
it felt good in my hand and is battery frigging free.
this was truly the only remaining feature which
I clearly don't leave a chance to ask for a subscription right
standard of 8192 - pressure levels and 60 degrees tilt functionality
or maybe even the larger size would be portable for you
the tablet felt really premium and has a great finish on its overall body
they already have some keys mapped on them
the tablet is pretty slim and this is where the USB C port is.
yes it has definitely fought many battles and won.
these keys won't need much force so it is bound to accidentally get tapped
we had literally no complaints when we used it on
Photoshop even ZBrush felt really nice and smooth with great response
there are still a good options from back home
I had said that I will tell you what these things do
mm jack on every goddamn gadget they release
it was autodesk sketch and start sketching on the phone or a tablet
I would always see a pointer which I tried to sketch on the phone
some would definitely prefer the form and some latter but on the node nine
I think it's going to be a very good deal
leave a like if you like my efforts on this video
if you have questions you can also reach out to who you on
they will always support you no matter if you buy the product or not
that's what my personal experience has been so far with them.
it's like 95% the same as a last model
but they did manage to shave a little weight off of it
I have with the tablet is just is it's quite heavy
so it's a bit heavy but the screen does look pretty good
we've got the power button and the volume and the headphone jacks
sports 256 gigabyte cards so has a quad-core 1.3
over these $49 fire tablet and it also has 1.5 gigabytes of RAM
I don't have any problem with that as the fun rear cameras
I don't know why you'd really use them a lot
we'll talk about the software a bit here so usual fire
I mean it's one of the dimmest tablets I've ever seen quite frankly
that's probably how they get to twelve out of our battery life
it does seem seem pretty solid so the storage options
so it's got about twelve point to four usable
at one point they had the option a while ago
it's really easy so this is actually the app
I'm using for screen recording right now and it works quite well
the audio gets kind of weird sometimes but
I'm recording that separately so yeah you can install the Google Play Store
takes like five minutes just installing a couple apps
you can check the e-book reader blog or my youtube channel
Amazon's app store so you got both about the best worlds and amazon
you got their music apps you got their videos so if you have
so you don't even have to pay for that if you have
you can't really like move files with it or anything
it's kind of limited so of course you've got
Amazon's videos on here you got Prime videos
you can actually download them if you want to view them offline
you can have different tasks done in here so
I'm not going to go into detail with that
Amazon this whole bunch of different Alexa skills
so just you can do these different flashcard decks and set this up
where only shows you one word at a time
it's actually a really different way to read
it's obviously something that's not available on the
so there's those different themes a lot of people like the black background
I really didn't like it had to turn that off
there's another cool like accessibility features in here
your text is a lot bigger easier to read so some definitely definite
there's also some other accessibility features in here so device options
you can like use this high contrast mode
there's like a voice screen reader thing that reads over the screens
I'm going to go ahead and wrap up this review right here
check out the e-book reader comm for some additional info
thank you guys and have a good day
hope you guys are doing absolutely fantastic today
in this video let's have a look at this teclast
p20 hd tablet 10 inch tablet full hd on a budget price
i'm gonna leave a link down below so you guys can check it out
i'll try to get a discount coupon for you as well so guys
oh yeah you can see a few specs here
so this is what we are presented with for a budget
yeah let's put it to the side for now moving on
it's not the fastest charger in the world for
it comes with the usb type-c charging cable also included in the box
let's do a walk around the tablet so you here
you can see the screen protected from fracture
i do believe them but it does feel a bit plastic
let me turn this around so you can see it better headphone jack there
you got the camera power button then volume rocker made of plastic
so you guys can see there on the side
got nothing and on the top alongside with the headphone jack
you have the sim card tray you can use
plus a micro sd card 64 or 128 gigs
there and at the bottom we have the microphone there
yeah overall i think it does look good looks
this is how the tablet will look like not much things pre-installed
you can decide what to install later on looking at the settings here
i'm not sure if you guys can see
i'm going to lower the brightness of the tablet
hopefully you guys can see it on camera so you have the night light
then it will dim the screen more of a yellow tint
the arm cortex a55 running at 1.6 gigahertz and here
we have a temperature of 23 degrees for the battery
let's have a look what we can do
let's for example run netflix and first thing first
let's have a look at the max resolution
it doesn't have the google white vine level one
it's nice you can change the brightness directly there on netflix
hey guys the colors look look good they look alright vibrant the sound
another thing of this ui is if you exit netflix
you can still watching that while you're doing some other stuff
i mean for the price of this unit
max so it's not the best to be honest
i think this is quite nice and handy
especially for the price octa-core 4 gigs of ram 64
please don't forget to subscribe to the channel
so I've been sent some more free stuff
this is the week a 50 graphics tablet
I do notice some people talk about having space on the desk
I'm used to because of the wet on and it's got two buttons
it's very similar really to most in the price range
the big players seem to be huion you
GXP pen and wax on and now peak there as well
interestingly week apparently are set up by people from new
I don't really notice much difference between this and a wheel to be honest
I suppose gestures a bit quicker the wheel actually
it'll be a bit awkward especially in blender
have you will aim left but with this
it's absolutely fine and you can just brush across no problems
it wasn't a big problem just every time
I change the color and went out of the window and back in it
you're a funny line but to be honest
I seem to find those sort of problems with every driver even whack on
the nice thing was that when you go onto their driver side which
maybe it is a touch more responsive than other ones pressure
sensitivity is all that you'd expect which is very good again
I would probably say this is my favorite now
this particular tablet sells for only 121 us dollars which is about 105 euros
we're actually getting quite a lot when you look at this particular model here
you can currently buy so it comes in this
so we've got a three megapixel camera here now
though so power button and volume up and down now
these are made out of plastic and shaking it
so this alloy here has a matte finish to it
you can see left and right aren't bad top and bottom
yes they're about a thumbnail kind of width there
and what about the width of the tablet
right here we've got a 3.5 millimeter out headphone jack
we have a very good screen in this
i did not expect it to be number one
the resolution is 1920 by 1200 and we have a very good maximum brightness
it doesn't work for the first quarter the slider until about here
so that's just one very minor little bug
there's a little tiny bit of leakage or dimmer pixels on the edges
it's only when you're looking at a constant white or bright image
you may notice a little bit but for the price i mean
this tablet comes with android 10 and it has a may security patch level
now don't ever expect to see an update from audio cube
it's just google apps you get with this one now
there is an app store here too and this performance is quite smooth
the four gigabytes of ram is helping recent app tabs
sometimes we'll get a little bit of slow down now
they've got the google search and you can't actually get rid of this
this is really silly to have this in there
and that's the apps to start with that we get minus mobile
i installed that when i took this screenshot here
so it's just the google bloat that we have on here
one search that means netflix is going to be in just standard definition amazon
they've had to save a bit of money
it doesn't actually feel like it does really
i'm not seeing any slowdown from the storage
that that when you install things okay it might take a little bit longer
you just need to lower settings and be prepared for the additional little stutter
here and there with the gpu's performance being quite low geekbench five score again
it's about like three hours almost to fully charge
so it's not particularly good gpu gps performance
where a house is so not amazing gps
you'll get the orders top and bottom here
so it's running on the youtube sitting here at 1080p
60 frames per second and it is flawless
and we've got the phone dialer so you can place voice calls
that's here and then the loudspeakers in a basic speakerphone mode call
so that is good now the quality out of the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
it is loud is it the highest quality
is google play books okay and this is quite fast
it's just the way the screen is coming through in person
it does look very good for pdf files now
a light engine for example like mobile legends perfectly
fine smooth nice and playable no problems there
so here's the front facing camera and the audio you're listening to
is that single mono mic on the front so for skype video calls
or maybe whatsapp calls and things like that and this is okay quality
your phone will have a much much better camera than these ones
i won't even bother showing you the rare three megapixel camera
and at least we do have one in this tablet so there we go
i think for the price that this really cannot be beaten
that is really unheard of normally for the budget tablets running android
your phone will have much better gps than this tablet
but we've got that option like the option of fm radio as well
i think this so far has to be one of the best
the gpu is rather weak and the chipset
now you know everything that is to know about the iplay20 here
and we're gonna we're gonna try this out today
the tablet came with this really swanky looking protective sleeve
the tablet itself is really lightweight and thin
the stylist has a really nice feeling grip to it
i had one of these from another brand
uh and i actually bought replacement nibs not realizing they were stored inside
so that's actually very clever that they have little instructions right on there
it also comes with the usb cord and two little extra adapters
it also came with little wipes and a quick start guide
i was pretty impressed with all the packaging
this was really fun to unbox but my first concern was that pen
i shouldn't be knocking these around but like i have three cats
the humon driver was super easy to set up
i used clip studio and i was able to start drawing right away
my first concern was that the canvas size would be a little small
products and a lot of their pens have erasers on the top
try to flip my stylus like 80 times before i remember that
and then you have to put it down and grab a kneaded eraser
i think it's a really solid tablet especially for 80 bucks
it's an affiliate link and i will get some money if you use it
so that's why i'm telling you also real quick
they're from my short comic far away which is available on gumroad
i guess but please let me know in the comments
that's it for me but until next time chase your dreams peace
I know a lot of you are saying
well what's going on with all those mobile reviews
where are the tablets where the laptops they're coming
it's a pleasant surprise for this model and we've also got of course
the dual sim support from the previous model
GPS but no hardware compass four gigabytes of RAM 64 gigabytes of storage
start asking questions so the charger we get
so we're going to five megapixel camera right up here
at the top the bezels are relatively large
you can see there about a thumbnail the width of them down the bottom
I still have the protector on here because I don't want to get
shame we've got right here a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
now this does sound good to me the quality no complaints
so that is good a little reset button here
there will be a sample in this review
this is again plastic but the quality of it does seem okay
maybe than most at five hundred and forty six grams okay
the scrolling performance here in Chrome could definitely be better now
I can't just suddenly flick and have it
now whether that's the touch digitizer it probably actually is
install that and then you can dim it down to acceptable levels
so there's no mirror vision application that we normally use to tweak
I'll quickly show you the gamma so gamma is off okay
look at just how it's performing so what
there is an over-the-air update system but I wanted to make it clear
they will probably just push out the tick last
we're on there and this is the free storage you get
here you can adjust the font size and the display size
I see this a lot with Chinese tech
so you can see and to two scores 141,000 not bad
this is a step up over the old
I don't know why it says real me v
Pro there it's because I restored a Google backup but trust me
this is this particular unit that I did run and - - on ok
I have had a couple of dropped connections
I don't believe the range of this tablet
I think on the kind of router you have
sorry so to skip that and all your on to better life
now this is the area where it is actually excelling this tablet
it really depends on the audio source on how loud they're gonna be
these speakers are very loud with some audio not so much
that sounds better than the tick last t20
I'm using Google Play Books and it does look pretty good
so it's gonna be fine for e-books a gaming performance
and it's actually really quite playable a big step up
let's see if I can just get this guy right here
there is up against the shotgun and I managed to take him down
so you got a playable flame-red here it's not the fastest
so this is a sample from the front-facing camera as you can see
the quality is below average and not amazing the mic as well
we being recorded on the tablet as well now the rear cameras
it's not really a priority you can see
I've teclast to install amazing wonderful high quality cameras
we've got a very good gaming performance for the spec
Shadowgun with a lot of stutters a lot of lag
they give us and get kills in fact
they ended up winning that round of a battle
then of course we've got voice calls text messages
it's solid and then the battery life really really good
you will struggle to kill this battery in a day
so there's some improvements coming but the screen is a downgrade
Chrome as you saw when I tried to
so the touch response then need some optimization
I feel the screen doesn't have white balance calibration for us me
revision app is missing no DRM level 1 cert
but you expect that so if you bought this to watch
so if you're in a budget this tablet does offer a lot
firmware software updates like a jump from 9 to 10
that's not going to come through with these
where your phone gets only 1 bar or 2 bar signal strength
G better of course but 5g not so great there
so thank you so much for watching this tablet review
no this is the Lenovo ThinkPad x1 tablet third generation
if you remember it was considerably smaller and considerably weirder
so you're not so limited in your use
gen is the thing now but finally no more the core a more core
you serious you can get the i5 or the i7 inside of here
so that's a lot of stuff to change and it's for the better
you are core i7 dish 8650 or your choice there
take the back cover up to upgrade it
not the one that we got no charging port
it's just a regular a Energizer battery that it comes with so anyway
this is latest wakame es generation with tilt support
you'd be talking to fine about just the tablet by itself
it's no place to put this in a silo
this is it doesn't have a USB a port
I don't think that it's gonna break off
so it is very thin for a tablet of this size
it's gotten a little bit heavier since last generation
so hey it's a magnesium and aluminum casing and yes it does feel sorry
it does as well as you would expect anything with this particular
CPU we have the core i5 model again
the clock speeds is consistent across the top
there is a fan inside which would be normal for you series
which usually isn't the case with lenovo ultrabooks
I still prefer Wacom AES latest generation a bit more than the entering
that's used on the surface products and HP spectre x360
just feeling really very nice and the palm rejection being a little bit better
so why buy this instead of the think they had x1 yoga
this one is a lot more rigid in fact they've reinforced it
it looks almost exactly the same in terms of the connector design there also
that keyboard is a little bit more durable instead of that
Alcantara stuff which you know can get a little bit nastier natty looking
do you see that on tablets but service pros certainly has it
you do get a fingerprint scanner on the bezel though so reports
and it's versatile so there's no more modular design the modular accessories
they try it out with previous x1 tablets
that's that's a pretty high bar there in terms of color saturation
life is just so-so it has a 42 watt hour battery
is that kind of average not too bad
it gets the award for most evolved to tablet in just three generations
the core speeds going on this is not much throttling going on
the display is lovely on this is certainly a good surface
Thunderbolt three ports it's great to have Thunderbolt rebut right out of the box
you're gonna need a USB a adapter for example
they sent it to me for free but as usual
i'm here to tell you my honest opinion about it
I just wanted to let you know this
let's display a tablet as eight shortcuts and I love shortcuts
I can't stress enough about how much I love them
control this tablet has overall a very narrow and elongated shape
which makes you look a little bit funny
so it's good for portability if you if you move around a lot
the tablet comes with a film over the screen
when you remove it the screen becomes matte
which is what you want to avoid annoying reflection and glares on the glass
download the driver and install it from here
it's quite useless because it doesn't really work
if you try to calibrate your pen things gets worst
so just don't ever calibrate it just an advice
this tablet unfortunately didn't work on my eight years old computer
I was ready to start but first off
I feel blessed every time I can export a video correctly
before or it's just like it didn't know digital art anymore in general maybe
I got a little bit of performance anxiety
lazy artist five million mistakes liquify so yeah after a while
I didn't put much effort into it anymore
I just tore it up and try to finish it as soon as possible
that's why the eyes look kind of weird
you get much more versatility so it depends on what you do now
you're probably also wondering in which way this come on display tablet
the fact is that on a 900 euros device was almost a thousand
you will get the same exact results and the same experience
do you like me posting digital art or you
let me know what you're thinking about it see you next time by
then we'll go ahead and take a look at the tablet itself now
i'm going to put that off to the side for just a second here
it's got a nice protector on the screen here
so we'll just peel that off so right off the bat
uh which i always appreciate and it's got that a nice glass front it
you don't have to really charge it up
you can just kind of take it out and use it right away now
it's very loud but even though it's loud it's very trebley
there's really not a lot of range to the sound
id or anything like that you need to use you
know like a pattern or a pin to unlock it
go ahead and play a youtube video so this is in 1080p
you can play up to 1080p youtube videos netflix
anything like that and the quality looks really good again
i'm going to give you a little sample of what the sound sounds like
it's going to be pretty loud but it's it's pretty much all trouble
everything on the screen is nice and clear and crisp
if you're in a dark room you can turn it down
uh pretty much all the way and save a lot of battery life okay
so if you want to play asphalt definitely playable on this tablet
okay here we are inside pubg and i have the settings
it'll go right now so here we see
uh you saw i killed a couple people again
the graphics are stuck at a certain level
mobile looking smooth so far graphics aren't too horrible
we'll see what the graphics are set at so graphics
you're going to be able to play call of duty
here's some video quality from the rear camera
i found that my hand would obstruct the camera often another thing
then here is some audio and video quality from the front selfie camera
quality for the rear camera is actually pretty good
it's just the settings that i had open as you can see
there is definitely a little bit of lag here now
it doesn't feel like it's going to break so build
it's got pretty good battery life as you saw
i didn't see any issues especially when you're watching videos on youtube and netflix
keep purchasing products to do reviews to you guys so
pro drawing tablet this is a review unit that was sent to me from
I'm going to show you the things included in the box
it's exactly the same so these are the items that are included
Android version 6 in addition to Mac OS and Windows
so you do not need to charge it
it's not too light and it's not too heavy
stand the bottom here and here this is
Robert it has a very good grip on the table
it comes in two sizes the one that I have here
the smaller model it's 9 by 5 inches
I will consider a medium to large size
this is u.s. 129 dollars at the time of this review
the smaller model is $40 cheaper at u.s. $89
if you are new to graphic tablets well
this is the sort of tablet where you have to connect to your computer
you can actually use this as a trackpad to control your mouse
and when you tap on it this will register
you can control the brightness as well the overall look of the tablet
it's very thin and you can see this part here
it actually slopes up to the Express key and this is metal
the buttons they have reef feedback on the back
let's take a look at what you can do with the driver
you are not going to be able to move the cursor on
the two side buttons can be configured to mouse clicks or specific keyboard shortcuts
he just shows you the monitor you are using
you can use this tablet with dual screens as well
for you to jump the cursor from one screen to the other
so let me start by testing the hatching lines the initial activation force
so when you apply a very light pressure you can get very thin
lines and thick lines when you press down really hot
we just the lines they come out just the way
I want them to so this is fantastic and now let's draw something now
sizes you can expect this level of performance with other perfect apps so
I'm not going to show you all the apps today
I'm just going to show you the ones that perform a bit differently overall
it's really quite satisfying to draw on this tablet
I didn't experience a lot of glitch except for Krita on Windows
it has just the right amount of friction and pressure sensitivity
this is one that I can recommend very easily
this tablet is definitely good enough for line art and also for digital painting
I have it on tablet PC and my pressure
so let me test it out and see how well it performs
I'll need to use this USBC adapter to connect to my phone
it's going to ask you if you want to use this
installation is required for this tablet to work with
tablet the bit quality the design and of course the drawing performance
if you want to save some money you can go for the smaller model
I'm happy to say that this works pretty well too
c'mon who asked me to do a product review but everything
I think to feel sturdy and durable but also light enough to be portable
we have the stylus individually wrapped similar to tablet
I think it's supposed to help you do that
you need to connect the tablet to the computer
hours of non-stop you so you don't need to worry about it
running out powerful quite a while after its first charge okay
so that's pretty much everything that's in the box
I'll be using the tablet to finish destroying of my OCE luma
I didn't mess around with it too much
I did notice what a tablet was that there was no mouse mode
well is pretty functional as you can see
I did like that as soon as I started using it
the speed felt really good like really natural
I did find that when I first started using it with Medibank
it seems to be the case with most tablets
I'm gonna kick this drawing into time-lapse now I'll be back once
I really didn't know where it would be going had to start
it never really worked out before but today
apparently it is so we'll keep going at it at one point
if that happens usually the best thing to do is to restart everything
and it's like there's so many of them like honestly
it has all the things that tablet needs to have
I know for low artists who are students or young and have no money
think this is a pretty good budget choice to go with
there's a link down below in the description to my blog
I really wasn't expecting it since I'm still such a tiny youtube channel channel
anyway thank you guys for watching and as always
I hope this video was helpful and I'll catch you all soon so bye
it's an extra monitor that you can plug into your Mac or Windows computer
you can draw directly on the screen using the included pen
there have been a whole bunch of these 15.6 inch display tablets
our adjustment buttons along the back of the device
that's currently not doing that is Wacom Cintiq Pro as of now
I wouldn't be surprised if we see that
the screen itself has a film on it
it's really nice to have a dedicated place to put it
so tell me more about this pen you keep talking
the whole thing is made of a soft rubber flares out at the tops
there are also two buttons along the sides
the pressure of the pen itself feels pretty good
this is where we get to my favorite boogeyman
I'm talking about line quality and that's where I see some problems here
like how do you define what is acceptable
and and what's not like what is like a tablet color and here
I'd put this device somewhere in the middle
just use a stroke straightener all the time
if that's the kind of line you're looking for that's a great question
the line tends to lag behind the pen tip
it's not uncommon to accidentally stop short same with fast hatched lines when
I do have to draw quickly or faster lines
I'll often just toggle the stroke straightener off so I can get the lines
so speaking about the pros and the cons of this device overall
those are some of the better things about it
I look at all of the other devices out
I think I've reviewed five of them now
that just have a better pen to them
begin with this is the first display or any kind of product
it's going to be super interesting and fun and I'm excited so the tablet
I'm just going to tell you my honest opinion
the tablet comes in this plastic sleeve for protection is a very thick material
the size of it is kind of like a safe
but it's not too big or too small
I do like the size of it and it is pretty portable
the plastic is this lightweight kind of plastic
it is just a very light tablet and so
so the pen pressure is 8,192 levels of pressure
the way the tablet feels the pen has a really good bounce to it
but there's some tablets that are very stiff
and that is that the lines don't come up smoothly and so
not because of the tablet though because of my computer so
I just recorded the screen with a camera
I'm sorry that it's striated and it might hurt your eyes for a second
just bear with me as you can see
I don't know you can just you can see what I'm talking about
it doesn't really have this effect the lines come out smoothly but when
I'm working a higher resolution which I usually do
yeah that's a pretty big downside to me
I would recommend this tablet since it is sturdy
this thing is a pretty big problem but it might not affect to you
I think this tablet would be pretty good for you
sensitivity is amazing so I would recommend it for those features
everything is perfect about it except for that smoothness feature
if you like this video please leave me a thumbs up so
just you know two extra videos that speak cool beans
Caesar Brutus is just as cute a Caesar can't Brutus
okay for one person to be the boss of everybody huh
because that's not what role was about but you totally just stab
Caesar hi my name is Chris Thalia or crystal and today
2200 tablet damaged out to me recently and a story together and of course
a pen it stands nibs a glove and the cables
I'm like oh my god I broke it what do I do
that was us but after the 10 minutes everything worked out so smart
I used to stack binders and notebooks to get an incline
so you're able to put some body weight onto it
I mentioned earlier for how the tablet works
Mohini on screen and the surface pro steps compared to all the springs
so it's laminated screen is thinner and allows a more accurate pen stroke
I'm glad my main programs are supported in the speedpaint
they have a picture showing some of the bigger brands to support so
the process of adjusting was explaining the meaning emails
the tablet is four hundred and forty dollars so everyone is broke get out
I consider that original four hundred thirty paid over multiple times yeah
I'm thinking about investments so overall my opinion this tablet is it's pretty great
welcome to the world exclusive unboxing of the aqus 70 internet tablet
tab - tab is 650 this is 250 and this is in the
I'm not really sure you have some live wallpapers
you can launch some random random stuff you have email
well the only that parkus has made and here is the F cos 43
the high looks the only difference with the Galaxy
internet tablet this is a new capacitive internet tablet from F KERS
let's go back here so there is of course a full
I'm going to type in tech name did I click
no okay so there everything is about the iPhone Apple iPhone Facebook
let's click carrot just the random article article
we can see this article learning so right now it's running
that's the guy who signed the contract and lost all his facebook stuff
they have widget as well the way they did
and it's there and then there's some Facebook installed Facebook
oh yeah you want to see how it looks
check it out the design of this and
so it's better to have that like something
well you've seen them already dad you wanted to see
there's a power switch like so you can charge
then it's there use the device as a touchpad controller to control
TV so easy I click here can resume
yeah and click then just starts playing an HD TV resumes playing
I just need to click the play button need to turn on the volume
there's no volume on my TV right now but you get the idea
it's not super for reading and all this time
I had a bunch of things running in the background
so they're working on the Android 2.2 firmware
hopefully it's going to be released like forever very soon
but actually this sound is muted for some reason
maybe yeah it's told naps that muted the sound oh yeah
I think it's one of those buggy games need to uninstall
we'll just make sure you're not burning your background
you can go from one thing to the other back to
Facebook I can write what's going on here on my of course 70 dare
this is this is what's what you get
I think it can fit in a jacket pocket
so you really get them massively big you get a huge
yeah huge huge internet in the pocket experience
I'm gonna go over everything that comes with the tablet
that looks a lot like an apple charger from a MacBook
that's gonna cost you an extra 80 dollars all right now
let's move on to the review now with this tablet
processor all the way up to a core i7 1.9 gigahertz processor
the tablet does include the integrated intel graphics 620
GPU for storage it does include MDOT 2 solid state storage
the trackpad does support multi gesture so that is great
I read like this keyboard and I could truly say that
let's take a closer look at the tablet itself on top
VGA IR camera with IR LED emitters that meets the Microsoft
so you're able to log into the tablet easily with your face now
now let's talk about the options for the screen
the particular screen you see here is a 3k by 2k
I recommend going with the 3k by 2k LED screen
I'm gonna talk about the back facing camera
this is just a thin metal going around the side and the back portion
d3 is 13 inches which is much bigger than the surface
you're looking for the left side of the tablet
you do have your combo headphone and mic 3.5
and next right here is where your nano
SIM port would be if you ordered your tablet with that configured
the real magic behind the Amazon fire 7 is media consumption
Amazon's device is looked upon with envy by Apple and Microsoft
almost everything in this package is geared toward making money
you may prefer to simply buy this cheaper version
Amazon claims it is more rugged than the iPad Mini
UI another is insistence of an internet connection to validate downloads from Amazon
where it came, and inside we’ll find; the tablet
First let’s see how it performs on the computer though.
and what do we want to download; either the drivers or the instructions.
Hit submit and go down the page to find the drivers.
click on the empty box and press the key we want to assign.
I almost forgot to mention that back when I first tried it
As you can see customizing the buttons works just the same way.
On the bottom box we can check that
On Work Area, if you are using only one monitor
you barely need to do anything here except for adjusting the active area
so it is proportioned to your monitor, in case you think you need that.
You can also change the position of the tablet if you’re left-handed.
Let’s make some quick tests with different programs.
So now let’s try to connect it to an Android device!
On the instructions it is mentioned that if the pen isn’t detected automatically
and it'll tell you how to do it.
So after all that stuff let’s make a final test with a speedpaint.
The texture of the surface where we draw isn’t as toothy
or some other brands, it feels a bit more plastic like?
but not too much so don’t freak out.
The Intuos pro medium are of a similar size yet
So the verdict is; a very very nice tablet!
I can't stress how impressed I am at the pen’s sensitivity.

so so what's in this thing that's cool showing love to um supporters
um this um tablet is really solid like a metal backplate
actually that's one of the buttons on the side
yep well that's uh very soft sexy oh cool so not only
this definitely has some weight to it as well
I'll be using my Mac laptop and I'll be painting a portrait in Photoshop
six two inches wide there are 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity
I want to talk about what I really liked about this tablet
I really liked the size of the tablet
how it's a little longer than the typical tablet
I also really enjoyed how lightweight yet sturdy
how this tablet has the ability to go wireless
it's always nice to have one less cord in my life
the pen on the screen also felt good
the lines just worked and flowed so working with Photoshop
I also loved how this tablet came with this pen holder
my favorite part of this tablet though was the dial at first
it was just one quick swirl of the dial so
I didn't have to work as hard to get that dark opacity
I'm used to making the button on my pen
I couldn't program a keystroke plus a mouse
I'll definitely continue to use it with my laptop and Photoshop workflow
you're watching our hands-on review of a 8.5 inch LCD writing tablet now
the concept here was inspired by the boogie
and this is literally the end that you use to wipe down any marks
so if we write something on the board here like OS reviews
you can see that the color here is kind of inverted it
and it's a lot easier to make a mark on here
but you can't make as light marks on this one
I'm done with this if I wanted to erase it
well completely you race it as you can see there
that's when you can erase elements from the page so using the erase tip
I can actually exert some pressure here and you can see that
it's actually doing a surprisingly good job of erasing very small
you have to use the eraser tip here
and you're able to maybe create some more realistic doodles and heart work
it's kind of easy to make marks on this one
there are no magnets on the back of this model
you race also doesn't work that's pretty much it
I think that it's kind of an underrated technology
you know it's not the most premium feeling tablet
there's quite a lot of expandability options on the tablet
we're getting a dock here for keyboard expansion on the other side
I have too happy to say that it does the job
when you are looking at it head-on now look here
you know but nothing special really they could also
I think the Wi-Fi is the main kind of issue here with this tablet
the camera it has got one on it is 2 megapixel and you
can you know basically take a few shots here as you can see
it should be able to handle that pretty well
the frugal tack welcome to my channel this
I've realized that the 7 inch size is the perfect handheld size
anything bigger than that is gonna require a two hand hold 7 inch cheapo
tablets are rebranded with the same exact specs
and you're gonna have a higher screen resolution that than what's on this
I saw available the Samsung Tab Lite II
depending on your needs as far as the resolution goes with these cheapo tablets
but just understand that in this thirty to seventy dollar price range
I think they're just the same rebranded product if you enjoyed the video
please give it a thumb and post your comment below

I'm here to review my XP pen star
it cost me just shy of 60 euros
since you can just rebind it to whatever you need
I had to do specifically to make it work in
oh the other ones are just tiny minor things like and being scratchy
I personally regret is not buying a protector
that doesn't come over screen and that the pen doesn't have an eraser though
I'm just gonna go over the specs again
it is six by ten inch or ten by six
however you want to go about this and has a diagonal of 11 inch
it's like an eleven and a half almost 12 inch tablet
it comes with like eight nibs by default
you can place the pen on it or stick it in it
and yeah it's it gets kind of scratchy so by screen protector
if you're gonna buy it and it's good for what it is
it's very affordable suits most people easy to install and compatible for most computers
tablet sales are no questions slowing down and Samsung themselves
welcome everyone to another review going over the physical features first two things
I said the same thing last year when they finished tablets were introduced
it's about the experience and the little details like this
that gives an overall impression when you first pick it up
but let's go around the physical features here starting at the top
which of last year's model allows you to control your TV with your device
now moving through the right side very cliquey power
charging port justify to the right the 3.5 millimeter headphone ports
there's nothing on the left side of the tablet but rotating to the back
it is plastic with an aluminum paint light texture
Samsung obviously didn't go full aluminum which is fine by me
but the build quality all around is still very well done
the fine letters are just not as crisp
I guess to compare to the other model for the average consumer
wow factor but the resolution is still done well
so yes those heavy into watching movies and widescreen formats
the system specs are on your screen according to tech times comm
it is an older processor with quotes around the word older
this is still very zippy in a very fast device and we're world use
zippy and fast for all of your needs regarding battery performance
I ran two movies and then the following day tested
here and of course left the tablet on standby overnight
I was shocked that Samsung did not advance on
here the heir to Samsung still offers more features and I still believe
it's a great design but when you compare
the build is still fantastic despite that SD card readers slot now
you guys take care and I see in the next one
hey everyone welcome back to another video in this video
this is 100% my own opinion of the product
next is a pen that does not require a battery
it has the same drying space as the
but there's a few hotkeys that you can press for tool shortcuts
and it's by far much more affordable plus
a lot quicker it is a must for speed and also
well that a normal pen tablet should do so
and lastly just to quickly talk about the image you see me working on
I prefer coloring with these types of pen tablets rather than drawing with them
so if your if you'd like to purchase the tablet
I'll leave a link in the description box below
I'll also leave a link to that as well
I have to say about this pen tablet
I have a tablet inside of it and to be honest with you guys
I'm going to go and check this out
this is actually the tablet that we have here
and it's we pronounce this this is X kadhi kadhi tablet PC
this is actually the very very force start of that
we also have grown-ups only so 5 plus 19
this is the official system of the tablet
we have also half please two as well so guys
we can download our own apps and up here
we can download whatsapp we can do with Facebook Instagram
and all of those are the apps that you saw enjoy
i wanna so when you go to a one
this is actually the children desktop so we can go in
if you want to go out we can go back
and then we good to go here we are in the official
so that's the beauty that I like about this
I am going to go to the settings
I'm going to give you the model number which is T 9 0 1
a 33 this is also android 6.0.1 so guys it's the IB laptop
if you guys are looking for one of these to buy
all right this is the review of the arcus generation 8
you can see here the the this is the new
Android experience a very very powerful device with a very fast
the six or five which was had the same screen size as this
now right now they are going to release it right now
$1.99 the idea of this device is to compete with that
it's an iPhone but it's the same iPod Touch
and you see you get a bigger screen
let me just turn it on like this right here
I don't know it works something like that
you see you get a bigger screen a much bigger screen
I don't need that and gadget all right
if you're close enough you can maybe see that
I can have access to 2 terabytes of the movie
you can add a microSD and there's HDMI output that
it might not take very long time to charger and pure need to test
it went from 42 percent to 99 99 percent charging
I looks there is this which I've tested already and Aoife
this speaker is free now and then you can play
you've seen that before and I'm really really good at this game
does everybody else say they're not pretty good
right here and this is using the oculus 43 as a mouse so
the best way is not of course retina
I had a problem connecting the Samba file share so
you're not gonna put too much of it because then
the last is on the top okay camcorder mode for McGee per second
which is the most compressed 723 camcorder that I love
it and performativity can even go lower than that
I don't know how haha the resolution is of this picture for example
it's much better to use a mouse and a keyboard
hi everyone cynics of Syria with chewy iPad ltd tablet
the tablet is powered by a decocker magitek annual x7 processor
10.1 inch display so performance is quite good
there is a phone camera and the rear camera
I tried and similar to my show me a one and A two phones
Mac I'm not sure you can see you cannot see
I will rest a little over eight hours
that's very good other feature that works well is
GPS okay okay and we get a fix almost immediately
let's go easy with candy crush saga first
you may want to connect external speakers is soft
I also try BB racing and Riptide gp2
okay let's go to video racing quickly have a look
we have to be patient because this game loads quite slow on all platforms
oops okay so this game is terrible by singing we lost over show you
I want to be asked to check the multi-touch so let's go
okay so okay this one we show that
sometimes we miss key prices but on the up keyboard
okay so let me take it out to bring up the soft keyboard
let's delete it and I will try to type you see I press them
d I have to press again so there was three times
I had to press twice because it didn't register on my key press
some light gaming is good so you may
now this is a 10 inch or 10.1
Android so I didn't mention that runs Android 3.1 honeycomb which is good
and even if it's the first time you're using one it's very simple
that looks like there's a dock connector site
that is what it looks like on the outside
they kind of add their own apps to it but before
I do you'll notice the size of the bezel on the side
I guess that really adds to the thickness when you do
turn the tablet on okay when you turn the tablet on okay
I think it's a little bit too thick
I know for example the Motorola Xoom is a lot of thinner
besides that that the screen is actually quite good
I do think that it was built for you to hold it this way
it kind of feels like this is what they wanted so
I just realized why I won't tell because I've got the screen locked
someone gonna love it some are gonna hate it
I guess maybe make that the CAO button
I know I'm only going to touch the one button there
okay so let's have a look at the inside of this thing
alright so we are looking at the this tablet you can see what
I did was sign in with my Google account and a straight
which is fantastic when I go into the apps
like the calc app which is you know your spreadsheets and things like that
so same thing with powerpoints called show and there is one for word
I think it's a great addition to the Android tablet
furthermore there's also a file manager so most of them do have this now
Picasa so really cool muscle interface for the media player
Wi-Fi Bluetooth whatever you need to do so I think that's super super cool
they were just added some great little features
I just think that cameras in a really annoying spot
I'm kind of rushing maybe but I don't think that I don't want to
you know those sort of things really are changing the game
changing the cub is making a bit more personal
I just think it's a little big you know
there is hard for this tablet to be competitive
I think I wouldn't want to carry this around every day
it's just a bit too bulky and this bezel thing
I think they just could have used the screen a bit better
Docs but it's going to be right here
work on it on the on your couch
whatever you want save it back your laptop super easy and
I think it's just a really cool way of doing it
I'll put the link up if you would like to donate as well
Hello everyone, and welcome to this review video of the XP-PEN G640.
So the package comes with the tablet itself in a cute fancy little wrapping.
Even if it seems kind of "too much", that's actually a very good specificity
I don't know for you guys, but I always end up either
losing or breaking all my pen nibs, in fact
I wear them quite fast as I drag unlike most top players
Alright so the first thing we're gonna do after plugging
our tablet is downloading the proper drivers on the company's official website.
After downloading it, install the right driver according to your OS.
It's not specified anywhere but I suggest you reboot your computer just in case.
Now you should see this icon on your Desktop.
From here you can pretty much configure your tablet
I don't really know why, so I suggest you disable both of these.
Also, make sure to disable Windows Ink, that shit is not good.
Alright, we're ready to play with it to see how it feels now.
I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised
players are interested in anything other than the active area
and the pen's accuracy, but here you go.
As I already mentionned, its surface gets nasty
And finally, and for me that's the biggest drawback, the pen button
this thing is metal on the back plastic on the top and the bottom
I don't like that I actually bought a matte screen protector for this tablet
just kind of sucks especially when your hands are sweating so
I bought a Mac screen protector for that
that's just one area that I don't like about this
I will say that my hands are fairly small
um anyway let me show you color in some other place
then yeah the the color here is okay
I will say that I don't really have much of a
I don't have much or many complaints about the color here
the color here is a little bit a little bit more washed out
and you're looking at tales of demons and gods the manga
granted my recording room is a little bit brighter than most other rooms
it's perfectly viewable indoors but outdoors not so much because in outdoors
you really can't see this very well and you got clear here
that could be it but again touch sensitivity
I'll say it's barely passable in terms of the face
yeah not fast at all you got your mediatek helio
it's really nothing special in fact the Android unit I have in
there's like a little bit of lag when you're swiping to Google
now when you're starting up it's ok you swiping down
it's it's a little bit jumpy put it that way
it's still not super fast but it was you know passable
YouTube by itself like they're the original YouTube app
that was whatever it wasn't that fast either candy crush
the value of life on this thing is insane
I did not expect the battery life to be this good at all
I think yesterday I used it for I think 10 hours
yeah so mix of manga and candy crush
I like it okay moving on bluetooth and Wi-Fi both work there
sorry about that okay moving on to a gaming so
I felt extreme already but I'll play it one more time old
I'll use a different race track this time
so it's a bit more interesting but again with gaming it's it's actually
I'm good because the mediatek helio p22 tee
I've never I've never really been a huge gamer
it's really hard to talk and game at the same time
I think I wind myself off candy crush for a while
and then and then he just came back with a vengeance
finally talking about the camera on this thing
I don't get why tablet manufacturers still putting cameras in their tablets
it's stupid and just bad quality both the front and the back camera
I looked at the pictures I took and I was like no
I mean you guys still got a long way to go on this
that was pretty much it for the review of the lenovo tab now me
I'm trying to remember if I've missed anything and I actually do remember
charging this tablet takes forever with the included charger
that's hard to say because for myself i love it
i mainly use it to read comics and read manga and the long battery
life is a huge feature on this like a huge feature
I said it I used it for 10 hours
hi this is kayla from pakka blocks comm today
I have read a lot of reviews regarding this tablet online
some data is not that good so today
first for this particular tablet it supports 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity
here there are some buttons that have been pre-programmed with keyboard shortcuts
and there's this little hand too there are also additional shortcuts here
I can press them without looking at them
I use by canon scanner so you can share the cables
this is actually a cable from my canon scam scanner
some of the things you can change our the button functions on the stylus
there are two buttons here so you can change them to different settings
for example mouse click left right needle or a specific keyboard key
so this by the way will be at default
is this little charging pot here at the back
just that is it's very light so depending on your drawing preference
sometimes you may like a heavier pen sometimes you like appendage light personally
this is the tip and this is replaceable
I think there is a bottom at the stem
this is the bottom and it comes with four replacement nibs and there
so you can see the cursor moving around here
I'm just going to show you some very quick very feet
hashing lines so this tablet is actually quite sensitive
and if you press down hard you can see that the lines
they taper quite smoothly as well and they taper very gradually
it really depends on what kind of lines you want
I'll try some thick and thin lines to show you now
I know we don't have that some of them
you know those wanting tests where you can draw on
let's switch over to another software called MIDI Bank paint
let me just create a new file and try to and launch this alright
let me choose this pen here and show it to you
the lines still continue to come out so now on
that's um do some very quick strokes again
it works very well on mischief the software
fine let's do a recap on the pros and cons of this tablet
I also like the buttons on the left side
however you can reassign them if you want to
the drawing surface has a nice matte texture to it
this is actually very similar to work on tablets and as for the cons
but we've found the software that I showed you earlier
so if you really do want buy this tablet
I think that's the probably the biggest con to this tablet
I bought this around 70 to 80 US dollar
it's usually 2 times as much so that's 160 dollars
our program reviews sketching tips and tutorials bye you
I used a different USB to fix the problem
lastly the package comes with a nib removal tool with three replacement nibs
next let's talk about the driver while you can download the
I still decided to use the tablet driver created by
okay so let's get on to the gameplay come on
I mean if they're playing maplestory is spending money on it
they're probably rich anyway because cute louder buddy
Jesus before light pulses it was me quiet
it just came out rolling girl by various artists
they have given me the in spy in spy
I was greeted by a cute little as saying
I really liked the idea of having a little Frankie Lera
just enjoy the speed plate with me drawing with it
I was sent some tech to review by who young they sent me this
Inspira H 950 P which is one of their more popular pen tablets
I'm excited to see how this stacks up against what I currently use
the working area inside the tablet is 5.4 inches by eight point seven inches
so having an undo button is pretty nice
I'm really excited to try out now before I get started
and that's as simple as going to hooey on tablet comm slash support
H 950 P with the tilt and I'm gonna download the driver for Windows
ok so after working with this for a little while
I I gotta say I'm really impressed with this tablet and coming from me
a lot of you guys already know star g6 40 it is
it's also going to have six customizable buttons so you can program it
which means you can use your left hand for multi purposes
let's get to the unboxing of star g6 40s by XV pen
I'll be using a box cutter to open the tape
it says please visit XP Pen website to download the latest driver
I'll have to replace that pretty soon as we open this up
we're going to be greeted with the pen
cable management tied thingy which is also a nice touch this
a warranty policy booklet a warranty extension card and a small quick guide
I'll also bring my CTO for 80 pound for comparison as you can see
there's also a s 640 pen for good measure
why not write and also to add more will have a galvan
v pest pen for xc10 g6 40s tablet
it's going to hopefully help with the slipperiness of the tablet
it's not like ultra thin like the g6 40 or gamma s 56k
the connector is gonna be on the left side of the tablet
might you know wonder if that's going to be interfering with the keyboard
it and the active area is supposed to be small on the g6
oh yeah and apparently this is covered in plastic
40s tablet driver which is third row down
down in this case can go ahead and click download
I'm clicking between you know the full area and the forceful portions
what's better is that now when you click this one on the right
this tablet does not have any rough surfaces
made the tablet surface looks nice and clean overall
you can just have it out all the time and be like
as for the price thing the g6 40s is currently sitting at 45
I believe spending the extra 10 dollars for the better build
40s was the perfect balance between smoothness and latency
I believe exactly the same being replicated on the g4 g6
40s was a huge plus for me and as for the final verdict
really nothing's holding this tablet back at all if anything
everything is preferential in the world of tablet
thank you very much for watching this video
I'll be glad to answer any of them
- [Aaron] The Wacom One is Wacom's most affordable display tablet to date.
As always, all opinions in this video are my own.
Repeating names for multiple products seems to happen a lot at Wacom.
Personally, I would have called it Wacom Two, but I digress.
It has the essentials you need to make digital art and not much else.
The screen measure is 11.6 inch wide by 6.5 inches tall.
So it's not the best screen in terms of clarity or color accuracy
The Wacom One is using an AHVA display with a Wacom EMR digitizer
And there is a matte anti-glare film applied to the tablet.
The film is applied very well without any bubbles or edges peeling off.
One is much closer to the Cintiq Pro models which I like.
which is more than adequate for drawing and painting.
Wacom is offering, you're still getting a top-of-the-line pen experience.
The pen is lighter and smaller than the Pro pens and similar in
look and feel to the one that comes with the Intuos.
There are three spare nibs hiding behind legs.
Wacom pens like the Art Pen or the Pro Pen
2. But it does support other types of EMR pens.
I can even vary the width of my line by pressing harder or lighter.
There are a few other pens that are supported and more pen
The line tests with the Staedtler Pencil are great too.
I notice that the Staedtler Pencil grips the surface more.
Having a button on the pen is definitely useful too.
Now let's move on to discuss the build quality of the Wacom One.
The stand is built in to the tablet.
There's a nice fabric pen holder in the top center.
You just slide your pen in and out of this.
As far as the screen temperature I didn't notice any warmth.
The edges and the back of the tablet are kind of an off-white color.
And just for clarity, there is not a built-in computer in the Wacom One.
Now in order to connect the Wacom One to a compatible Android
Wacom's adapter which is not included, or a USB-C mini hub.
It's not like the Intuos Android that I reviewed
And there's lots of other options you can tinker with.
There's Bamboo Paper which is a note taking app.
This is a great digital drawing and painting application.
but as of the making of this video it's not available quite yet.
So what can you do with the Wacom One?
You'll of course need two USB ports, one for data and one for power.
You can also use the Wacom One as a portable monitor through HDMI.
you might wanna use a monitor to monitor your video recordings or your photography.
One might even be a good tablet for photographers
who shoot on their phones to do some editing on the go.
Best of all Premiere Rush syncs with the desktop version through the cloud.
And I have to say, handwriting on the Wacom
One felt really natural while using the Staedtler Pencil.
So let's talk about some pros and cons.
One are that it's a very low-profile and lightweight device.
The Wacom One supports other types of EMR
Pens which is great. And it supports some Android devices.
The Wacom One does not have any express keys
Concerning the stand, 19 degrees is not the most comfortable angle to draw at.
And there's no way to adjust the angle to a more vertical orientation.
It could be dirt from your hand or it could be grime
If this was your first time on this channel, check out
Thanks for watching and I'll see you next time.
let's jump in and find out so just looking at this writing tablet
you have the main stylus here that used to actually write on the screen
inch screen up the front as well and LCD screen
it'll clear off and that seriously is all there is to it
I find that I generally try and use this
because of the technology they're using in the display
you can't rub it out or anything you do actually have to start again
which you know is a bit of a pain sometimes
it would be great if you could erase it and likewise you can
you actually can't like you can't save the image or anything from the display
the fact that you can't erase anything or you know
save what you've done without you know just taking a photo or something
Oh like it comes out really well actually it takes
and you know the pin just sort of flows over the display really easily
like it's lag free like there's actually zero egg it just happens straightaway
I really don't think you can go wrong
XP pen so special thanks to them I can check this out
but before we look at the tablet in greater detail
let's take a look at the items that are included in the box
we have a thank-you card and some brochure warranty policy
Start card and this year this is a four gigabytes USB thumb
there are eight replacement tips included this ring here in the middle
the stylus included is not powered by battery
so you do not need to charge it
this pen supports slightly over 8,000 levels of pressure sensitivity
the charging cable comes with two velcro straps
this is so much better compared to you know this black wire
it's the same for other brands of tablets as well on the back
this is the on/off power switch for the tablet
you are not using the tablet you can choose to switch this off
this tablet has an auto slip function after 15 minutes of inactivity
let me just put a wireless receiver in
he was shot cuts to the two side buttons
and if you are left-handed you can change that here
this is where you can test a pen pressure
but let me just show you what you can do
scroll down here and you can choose different functions
I have a really filter of the functions that I do not want
I want to use the scroll down to increase and decrease my brush size
OK and now when I press this shortcut button
can you see the more changes from brush size to zooming
I can apply a very light pressure and get really thin lines like this
I can press down a bit harder to get thick lines like this
let me show you how the lines how smooth the curve
some other tablets may draw curves like this or circular objects
sometimes you can see angular strokes but here the curves they are very smooth
you have to install welcome in towards driver
I'm using the scroll down to change the brush size
it's really easy to change the brush size
it does depend on the app that you use
the overall drawing experience is actually quite good
these are the lines that I was talking about
it's quite impossible to draw smooth lines with
Krita for some reason it's not just with this particular tablet with other tablets
it's able to detect pressure as well the last app
I like the overall build quality and the design
the link will be in the video description below
with the antutu benchmark but that's not supported here since the Samsung Galaxy Tab
a 10.1 is such an interest in competitor
get closed fast on the background as they do on tablets was more
but the gaming performance is excellent for its price
iPad is much faster but it costs twice
I suggest you get a case for it
it's the first Amazon tablet with a USB C port
well as you can expect from 2 megapixel cameras the quality is bad
Amazon is shipping the Fire HD 10 was the same 10.1 inch IPS screens
I always think that the resolution is fine on 10 inches
though so while the screen is not new
I think it continues to be fantastic in this price
range the Amazon Fire HD Tenace shipping with taya OS inversion 7.3
yes that's why apps like YouTube Gmail and the Google Play Store I'm missing
I didn't notice any big change compared to other recent fire tablets
you've got direct and fast access to all their services
Amazon photo apps own sake browser and a couple of standard ones like calendar
email app and the files manager integrated into file s is Alexa
I'm sure you're familiar with the voice assistant already the tablet supports Alexa
the tablet acts like an echo show and will display additional information
well the Fire HD 10 is running Android
lets get to its battery life in my standard battery test
the tablet cutter one time of 20 hours for this
in fact it's the cheapest 10 inch tablet
I can recommend without having to stay tons of downsides the value is fantastic
HD screen too and the build quality is similar
you're probably familiar with from your phone and you will likely get new
a cheaper alternative is the Amazon Fire HD 8
alright the end of my Amazon Fire HD 10 2019 review
I'm Angie thanks for watching and see you next time
I'm going to review the VK 50 graphics tablet
gearbest is a website that sells a lot of electronics
I have a really unboxed all the items so let me just show you
what are some of the things included so we have the foam pen case
it doesn't need batteries so you don't have to charge it
there are eight replacement tips included and a nib remover
this is the Quick Start manual and there this thank you cut
that tells you where you can download the driver
quality for this tablet is actually quite good
I left a single sheet of material plastic
but that's basically what you get with this track
nice rubber feet that prevents the tablet from sliding around
there are two side buttons construction the blue quality views very solid
there's a little wobble to the pen tip
which is normal because all these are pressure-sensitive styluses for graphic tablets
and when drawing on the tablet surface it feels really nice
I've just connected that tablet to my computer
I'm right-handed I'm going to do this now
and when the pen is near you see this light hat that comes on
there are several options that you can choose from
you can customize the clicks to different mouse clicks
you can assign specific keyboard shortcuts to those like buttons
there are various monitors switch as well but
I'm not able to test that because I only have one monitor here
let's take a look at the touch pad
if you click on the drop-down menu again
I have already customized directions to various shortcuts
I have customized it to zoom in and zoom out for left and right
I have customized it to change the brush sizes
so yeah that's about it for the driver
all these features are will go on windows as well
alright let's test out the tablet and see how good it is at drawing
these wages are testing out the different strokes
I'm going to use the trackpad to change the size of that person
so when you are drawing curves like this usually
the thin lines the thick lines clip studio works really well on this tablet
I can get in a thick lines very easily
it's not only two apps that has pressure sensitivity working
welcome bamboo paper and sketch of all those are apps
I'm not sure why only MIDI Bank clip studio has pressure sensitivity
that's all for my review today if you're also using this heaven
see you guys in the next video bye
so let's talk about the dimensions shall we
it's also 6.5 inches and it's very thin
I must say so this is a Samsung tablet
where is it this little doohickey right here called an S Pen haha
there's integrated graphics and an Intel Atom CPU woohoo Intel Atom
so it's not an i3 like some of its competitors
unfortunately the speakers on this are pretty good for a tablet
there's dual speakers on both sides on this chrome finish on the siding
there are also a front and a rear facing camera
the front camera is 720p and the rear facing camera is 2 megapixels
I personally enjoyed using this display however the resolution is only 1366 by 768
that's rather low for the 10-inch competitive market at this moment
you get pretty much everything you could want
Windows 8 device out there probably the surface pro
that one runs around $900 on their website
so this is priced very well for that market
Windows 8 and it can be upgraded to 8.1
both of those have much better resolutions than this guy does
it's very easy to use especially if you just want to watch some
Sailor Moon on YouTube but otherwise would I spend 750 bucks yeah
I'm Shannon Morse and this was the Samsung ativ tab 3
welcome to a new video on the geeky noise channel in today's video
Android tablet packed full of really good specifications and the value is fantastic
now they did send me this out free of charge
I'll prove it beforehand so I'm going to share with you my honest opinion
it's a nice lightweight design as well lightweight sort of metal design
in here with a frequency up to 1.6 gigahertz so a nice specification overall
it does have the Google suite of apps pre-installed
let's just check that it's running a nice
that's not even available in HD let's pop an HD video up
let's put a new newer video on here
I took earlier now just to let you know with regards to the cameras
I'm pretty sure the front-facing camera is I think it's 9 megapixels
I just can't find it so let's actually go into this through
oh here we go of course so here we go
here's some photos that I took using the Google Photos app
and here's one of they get all my life nice detail
the camera does perform extremely well very very good camera performance
you can also capture video as well and you must remember that
the cameras on a tablet is not often the strong point
pickups we've got the power on/off button we've got the volume rocker
we've got a couple of speakers and round on this side
so that's the closer look at the tablet before
I give you my final opinion on this and another little look
I could see an elderly person using this for simple usage
excuse my studio light sort of catching the screen on this
but this is what the tablet looks like again
it's got some metal construction in here as well
I certainly can recommend it at this price point
I think it represents good value for money and it's well worth considering
I've been really pleased with how this is performed
do check out the links down in the video description area
I want to thank you all for watching
I'll see you in another video very very soon
we have the chewy vx3 7 inch android tablet
you could just put your memory card in and there you have it
you have extra memory now if you take a look at the front panel
but we're just gonna take a brief look at the front panel
you'll find the three capacitive buttons at the bottom
that's the return the home button and the tabs button
so you know this will obviously allow you to use those functions
and then if we take a look at the top
which also allows you to make phone calls hence the use of the two
it says volume plus and volume minus and
so they're right next to each other means volume up and volume down
every phone has the volume up and volume down rocker
the microphone has to be there or somewhere in this region
I've you know I found really pointless now
put that out there for you guys to consider throughout this entire review
always have that stereotype to be not as good as your typical
and a lot of the time they are you know
they've had the worst displays the worst cameras the worst design and built quality
surprisingly they also be running on 2 gigabytes of RAM
they're offering me to review this tablet and at first
it cost 196 dollars and it performs like an absolute beast
you wouldn't really expect it from you know
I don't even know how you pronounce it
well if you're going to compare this tablet with for example
Samsung but you know this tablet really does win
i will totally advise you guys to go ahead
and check out the link in the description to the tablet
I have no financial relationship with the company
I really like just how powerful the magnet is on the latching mechanism here
you do get a little bit of image bleeding
you'll remember that that one kind of sits like that
that back kickstand here has a lot more surface area
it's very positionable so you have a lot of different ways
they even tucked away a micro SD card slot in the back
there - if you want to augment some of its onboard storage there
although for some reason it just stopped working
you're also reattach it and get it to go again
it's not too tinny and there is good stereo separation
DisplayPort over here for plugging in external displays
they do have some other docks that they're going to come out with
adapter here volume rocker up and down and a Kensington
you know this is the problem when you get into this
that will add some some bulk but also some weight to the package
they do have a little loop on the keyboard
if you want over here you can see when
closer to the screen that it's detecting its presence
what's nice too is it does have good risk detection
also so it's not picking up my wrists as I'm writing here
so you'll have some decent wireless capabilities here and it actually looks really nice
it really did very well on that as well and again
I'm really quite pleased with the quality of the display
this is going to do quite nicely here
and on the 3dmark cloud gate test which measures how well it might do
let's take a look at some movie watching all right so
I can skip ahead to different portions of the movie here no issues
this is a really nice little tablet device
I haven't been a big fan of this form factor
this channel is brought to you by my patreon supporters including gold-level supporters
and stand as you can see here some other specs on this
looks like it has a screen protector on it right now
you can see this little film right here so probably eventually remove that
and here's the keyboard also comes with a stylus okay
we also have a wall adapter and a micro
so let's take a look here so we've got microphone
it's one of the latest versions of the software
ok and let's go ahead and take a look at videos on this device
coming out soon so go ahead and play this projects so side
viewing angles on this device are pretty good
the only thing is the top and bottom viewing angles especially the top
hopefully that gave you a good idea of
how videos would play on this tablet now
and now there is a kickstand at the back here
this keyboard here is magnetically attached to the bottom
so we put this kickstand out and the keyboard connects through this microUSB cable
the document feature on this tablet keyboard works pretty well
I'm at when I'm recording this this video
I do find the keyword pretty easy to use
I've typed up a few documents on here
no problem and it's nice that it connects through this
this cable right here so it's it's instantaneous
it's been a pleasure to use and I definitely recommend it
my name is Alex and welcome back to a new review for today
Windows 10 and cost somewhere around two hundred dollars
so what do we get for that money
well first of all we get an IPS screen with 1080p resolution
so the tablet decides we have some advantages and some disadvantages
I mean it's awesome to watch a movie on this
you don't really want it all scratched up now on the left hand side
it's better than I was expecting so you can actually see the screen
I played the asphalt 8 and as you can probably see does work
it's definitely gonna be awesome to watch movies on it now
the battery life is not bad for me personally
I had to charge it every second day
we have insight and it's time to conclude this video so first things first
that's um why it slows down because it gets hot so for 200 bucks
guys hopefully enjoyed this video if you did like it press that like button
don't forget subscribe and I'll see in the next one
my name is Alex and welcome back to a new review today
we are checking out one of the most affordable 10 inchess tablets
of course the maximum resolution that you can select it's 720p but at 720p
then you can actually install apps on that SD card
and that's good because the tablet only comes with 16 gigs of internal storage
not to mention that you can actually make phone calls so this tablet
inches screen but the tablet is very slow
don't forget subscribe and I'll see in the next one
That naive person won’t be you, not once you’ve heard this.
So let’s start with the truth for tablet buyers.
You need to review tablets from different companies to know which ones are good.
send them an inexpensive tablet to “review” or “unbox”
And if you don’t do what they say?
I’ve had two different companies go so far as to request
So be careful where you get your tablet reviews.
Don’t buy something just because your favorite artist did a video about it.
for comparison, a decent tablet company will send you the product for free.
They usually have a long, typed up description for you to copy and paste.
This includes their social media, sale prices, information about products
you didn’t even talk about in your review, etcetera.
I’ve rewritten descriptions to be more clear, and was asked to change them back.
When this happens you’ll end up with a customs and import bill.
I’ve tried to get companies to pay this.
Sometimes you’ll be offered a chance to do a giveaway.
It’s also very easy to cheat in these contests.
One contest required winners outside of certain countries to pay for shipping.
in many places; giveaways must be free to enter and free to win.
Reviewing, sure, but little did I know that
I got absolutely nothing out of doing this.
You should be receiving the finished product ready for review.
The most recent development is review deadlines getting ridiculously tight.
Normally a company either mentions no deadline, or around 3 weeks.
Any of the stuff I’ve mentioned you can negotiate.
Say no, or even simply ignore unreasonable requests.
It’s your channel and you are an independent reviewer, not their sales department.
you know so they don’t fall into the same traps
I wish to stay focused on animation and animation tutorials.
My experience 100% mirrors these guys, and they do way more tech reviews.
Links below to their perspective on the Painful Truth About Drawing Tablet Reviews.
hello everybody Marco Chiappetta for hot Hardware here
let me get some specifications out of the way first
the note 10-1 is powered by a samsung exynos
we're just not sure quite when but it is in the works
so let's take a look at some of the design elements on the Galaxy
Note 10 one a couple of the first things
Samsung went ahead and moved the speakers to the front of the note
10-1 as opposed to the size or the back on many other tablets now
this setup allows the audio to be basically blasted towards your ears
this raised edge where the metal meets the glass
we have the dock connector and a microphone and on the top
that's a great move and the IR emitter and a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
there are a couple things to see on the back of the Galaxy
the s-pen is the stylus included with the Galaxy
when you slide that stylus out of its slot
so it's really just for viewing windows side by side now
let's let's pop that guy up here so this is something unique to Samsung
now you have a relatively small screen but as you see
you can use it to navigate the device just as you would your finger
let me bring up s note and show you what
the galaxy note was so popular and they brought the technology to the tablet
I want to thank you for stopping by
titles if you're not an Xbox owner you prefer PC gaming
Windows 10 PC experience ensure maximum productivity between gaming sessions
so let's take a look at the system itself for some reason
Microsoft chose not to sell the system in the United States
the system comes complete with a gaming cradle
microUSB port so you can connect your Xbox controller
you can do that if you want to
the tablet itself has a very good weight to it
it's solidly built has a great finish to both the casing and the glass
the tablet synced perfectly to my Microsoft account my gmail my xbox
my friend said that they can hear themselves when they spoke
now the cradle fits neatly around the tablet
you have your right stick right trigger bumper and the ax
I wish the grips were adjustable as far as the angle
you can do that sitting on the couch
it kind of throws you off a little bit at first
that's small enough to throw in a backpack or small bag
I've been mainly opted to use the tablet or in tablet mode
I don't rarely use the PC mode only when I needed to dig
and you know if you're starting to shop for a Windows 10 tablet
it's great you know what more could you really ask for so
so if you're looking for one good luck
I do recommend eBay for trying to search for one
Steven from Tech Steve HD comm making technology easier in this video
I have the Zen pad 8 version 3 atm so sit back
let's take a closer look at the tablet itself on top of the tablet
you'll find a 2 megapixel camera and the cool thing about this
this tablet is also available in five different colors
now and I showed you a little bit about the tablet
I'm gonna choose downloads and choose a blank app and so blue
and there's the main screen to put icons back on your screen
you can drop and drag them and you also can put widgets
let me show you how to do that
find the application that you use the most
you could have the display to automatically adjust itself or as the brightness
I can make a two hour video based off of that
you actually can make your own videos built into the software
I'm going to show you a couple samples of the photos
subscribe to my channel and I'll send the next one peace
and this is the Acer Iconia a 500 10.1 inch Android tablet
we'll take a look around the device and see back here
we've taken the plastic off the SIM card slot over here
and golly gee they beat motorola on this the micro
pikas the antennas running under the edges stereo speaker
but we assume there's a dock connector on the bottom for potential accessories
it's a pretty slim unit to the case is also not quite together over
it certainly doesn't look cheap or cheesy or anything like that
it's definitely one step up more than one
step up from some of the super budget ones
terms of sharpness and color saturation is good
right now if you're in a bright room
so nothing wrong with the display it's running Android 3.0 one honeycomb operating system
that's designed for tablets has a one gig of ram a dual core
but it feels like actually feels lighter than Motorola Xoom
Linpack as well and here we've got pretty much
your basic vanilla honey come so far not releasing any heavy customizations of honeycomb
I app which is a streaming multimedia hub
we'll take a look at that right now
there's no bookstore available in this region and the current bookstore
oh well you download something from feed books in fact
well grab a copy of one write night and no registration or anything
so you can just in one doesn't finish downloading it so
you're not going to want to read like this
probably you'd prefer to read in portrait mode
so we're going to drop that down and it handles that just fine
but that gives you the ability then to transfer files no problem okay
that's pretty much a known quantity we've seen on other android tablets pretty presentation
you can have your dual facing pages over here
the market has searched for both applications and books on honeycomb tablets
they've got their own photo browser on here we've got
it's a streaming media player for streaming it
you can see it has a little indicator up there that tells me
I supposed to put two fingers on the screen
of course you can just use it normally
let's check out videos and it shows you movies
now there's possible other application with just a front end to gallery anyway
you might say one or two frames drop here and there
but it's actually a fully animated video chalk up under the zoom here
so let's just take a look at the honeycomb
YouTube player which has of course a beautiful glorious wall of monitors metaphor here
they were all try playing something off of YouTube
Wi-Fi since this isn't a free Jean you know to have an N connection
it will visit our own website and this is the standard on-screen keyboard
the performance is very good on the dual core
Tegra processors but the controls don't exactly work real well yet
it's a hack and slash game starting off with the cutscene here
now this is the tech class m89 tablet a hundred and fifty bucks
what the site things are you know you have your buttons
headphone jack and a micro SD card slot as you can see it
you can see that the top and bottom bezels
LeBron James and on the sides here you have decent metals with bezels
that you can hold on to also as you can see
there's really not much to complain about the book quality
you might actually be concerned or you might
I don't really use AMOLED display phones so most of the LCDs you know
but they're not that much better and in this display that
Tecla 79 does a pretty good job and I like it quite a bit
it's actually very good for reading comics as well
I read quite a lot of comics a lot of Marvel Comics in
it looks very very good and 4x3 is perfect for reading comics
16 by 9 16 by 10 is a little bit narrow for reading comics
4 by 3 is what you want to get
I'm gonna show you what it looks like so as you can see
I don't really see that very often in tablets and even if I did
oh and before that the audio volume is super loud
so there's really nothing to worry about there all right
as long as it's optimized well so I think is very smooth
it's pretty much as smooth if not smoother than a shammy me pad three
I'm gonna clear all so I can show you what I'm talking about
you have three gigabytes of RAM and the 30 gigabytes of RAM is sufficient
but sometimes it's not enough so as you can see opening
you know it opens pretty much instantly the open on Google Play Store
does you know it starts lagging and slowing down and closing apps on you
it's I think it's filling up the RAM a little bit
so there's that to be concerned about now moving on to gaming
I was not able to play asphalt extreme every time I tried playing asphalt
extremely would tell me that this thing kept on crashing which is very strange
I think there just might not be enough
there was a little pop up there that was just to show you that
so there's yeah that's that's something that I I'm very surprised
I don't think ashwaldt has ever crashed really that much
maybe 190 at certain stories at that price
my name is Christian and welcome to another video
that's the name and it doesn't sound very interesting
I must say the template for sale on tequila
it's process er it comes with two gigs of ddr3
it has a whopping six thousand milliamp hour battery
it has GPS Bluetooth version 4 and Wi-Fi 802 PGN
so let's start with the pros with its five thousand milliamp hour battery
what more could you need with a battery this size
this is suitable for work and play even watching a movie on
the only problem though is that you wouldn't have to mind carrying around
there's a link to my review of that up there in the YouTube cards
and if you do know anyone would be willing to loan us
the device for review or possibly sponsor an episode of texans array
we will be reviewing the tech class p20 hd 10 inch tablet from lazada
it comes with a standard box packaging opening it up
the first thing you will see is a tablet wrapped in protective plastic
the tablet itself a type c cord a sim injector an adapter
you may insert a sim card and an sd card to expand
its storage or use it as a cell phone after setting up the tablet
it doesn't include that much bloatware or pre-installed
i also installed some apps that i usually use
but if you want to include a case it is worth 6499 pesos
p20 hd includes a 2 megapixel front camera and a 5 megapixel back camera
the front camera is decent enough to use for online class
the tablet could handle the software or the internet was too slow
your team destroyed the turret victory in terms of drawing on this tablet
the tablet has no problem drawing straight lines
it does however go uneven when drawing curved lines
this gives you a way to customize your phone system
then you will see the shortcut of the graphic tablet in your desktop
it is exactly 20 nibs as i counted
it won't focus lmao in pink color TADAAAA!
it is lmao maybe even if i throw it away
this is supposed to be unboxing but i got excited
this is a different version of it this is
it has the exact same specs but the performance is different
let's find out just like it's tennis brother
the yoga 2 8 inch is a sleek tablet
mostly silver in color with a variety of design materials
it would be hard to find a person to say
bezel at the bottom or side depending on your orientation
the front facing large chamber studio speakers are visible following the curve around
we will see the front of the stand to access the stand
I use my thumb to slide the stand out
The Stand sports for different angles or as Lenovo calls them
the top is completely bare and the opposite side
2 these two devices are the same under the hood the 8 inch IPS
the pixel density is 283 which gives it text that pops off the screen
this includes images to the color reduplication and saturation looks great
the high shine and the shadows gives you a sense of depth
the yoga 2 8 inch makes me scratch my head
I won't say it runs as smooth as a nexus 7
the yoga comes out of the box with
some would say is very iOS like and I would mostly agree
Lenovo package is a good amount of applications on the device
Android or there's a better alternative in the Play Store
one application that sticks out for the bunch is security
most of the applications are forgettable and quickly become background annoyances
the camera cannot keep up even in good lighting using studio lighting
lenovo has made a lot of strides with this tablet versus the 10 inch
make sure you check out the written companion piece down below
welcome to a video from the juice lifestyle calm and in this video
we're gonna have a look at the exit icon
fire it up and see what we can do with it
I'm just signed in with my Google accounts so fire a few things up
so let me just give you some of the specs first
it's hard to show really on the camera bodies
this usually shows up fingerprints quite well and actually
anyway he may come but say it's not the available moment
you also get a lot of these apps installed a support laces store
we've talked about these before these a be app
come and we've got a front-facing camera as well which is 0.3
megapixels so okay maybe for selfies and go and that is really about it
use a phone or my proper camera but it's nice to have the option
let's try some performance so here we are with the web browser
I'm accessing some of those services browser but once you're there it's okay
I think that the kind of things you would use this for
we'll try out some apps and see how that compares now
what a and let's just try a YouTube video
it's not sad it's pretty is decent loud
something called float gadget where you can have a floating window now
and then you've got the option notepad a calculator whoops
I use a lot on my Lumia phone
it's a game 3d game so as you can see
the process is probably pretty good for the game
there wait so so now we've got a game and with the Atom processor
it's got a sort of nice soft plastic back which quite like battery life
got some more testing to do on that
reasonable brightness not check the high resolution it doesn't feel too cheap
who is an 8 inch version as well
Chrome browser a keyboard a pen option and updates for eight years
that's because we get a mostly metal body
the upper part is made of a blue plastic
I think that looks fine but I know not everybody loves this
we're seven points three millimeters it is thin enough and with 450 grams
it's a bit disappointing that we get just one
USB C port there's no headphone jack and no micro
PC hubs and also connect external monitors and other accessories
there's no fingerprint scanner and you can't unlock it using facial recognition either
it's connected to the tablet using magnets and they're very strong
the cover is made of a plastic and the kind of fabric like material
it's not very premium feeling of course but that's okay
I like that you can open the kickstand quite wide
the keyboard is connected using a magnetic connector
so you don't have to charge it separately
the keyboard is a bit smaller than a standard one still
I was able to type with it very fast
do offer a real treble which is great
we do get the touch pad which sits below the keyboard
I reviewed the Acer Chromebook tap 10 but no other
Chrome OS tablet has been released in Europe since then I know
it will be much longer today than any
Android tablet will be the heart of Chrome OS is the Chrome browser
YouTube does not perform perfectly inside the browser
the tablet is so interesting because of Chrome at an affordable price
we get the kind of home screen like on
open them side by side and close them in desktop mode
the desktop mode is a bit more stable and seems more finished
Chromebook as a tablet I sometimes notice smaller issues
it is a resolution of 1920 by 1200 pixels and as usual
offer a better sound you can use the duet
you can rest your palm on the screen for instance and it gets ignored
you can start a new node very quickly sustainer notes
stylus you can write handwritten notes on your droid
you can get versions with 64 gigabyte and 128 gigabyte of internal storage
the tablet has to no micro SD card slot in benchmarks
Tab s 5e those are mid range tablets that cost about the same
the real-life performance is good too as I said so
both games look better even on the cheapest iPad
they do perform as they do on a similar end
other games like asphalt 9 and other similar games too
I wouldn't recommend it as a game tablet in particular
I think an N word tablet or iPad is much better suited
every tablet it gets released a man's rifle mine
thanks for watching and see you next time
I'm going to review the Bank u matrix pad s8
this is an 8-inch Android tablet very inexpensive
but let's see if it's worth your money
we'll look at that in just a moment here
love to see that in the tablet here
IPS display 1280 by 800 64-bit 1.3 gigahertz quad-core CPU
32 gig storage 4,000 milliamp battery good for about 8 to 10 hours
FM radio microSD expandable to 128 gigs and Google
but one good thing about that is if you're using it for extended periods
the display is very vivid has excellent colors and very good
it's a very nice tablet for a good price one $39.99 comedian
Amazon will be a link in the description as well
we'll see in the next video take care
they've got like this cute little fox character
it's very like pretty and modern looking with the silver and black
you can see there's like uh express keys there on the left
um but we're gonna be looking at that a bit later first
you've got like your plugs here on the left
we'll have a look at it a bit later
here is the pen it comes in this really nice
there's the quick guide that has the installation instructions
it's just all loads of different languages in there
there's a little cleaning cloth that you get which is very nice
i'm gonna go over that a bit later to show
this is where i immediately screwed up because i took off
it kills me so what you're going to do is pull that tag
uh you just pop out the back like that you can see
these ones on the left will be going into your pc
so there's the black hdmi and the black usb
those would be both going into your pc
i point at the diagram there and this is what it looks like
whether that's mac or windows i have windows so i'm gonna download that one
when you open that it'll ask you to install
i thought it felt really nice like while i was drawing this
i didn't really feel uncomfortable any point i wasn't really stuck to my tracks
um the tilt is a little bit off you can see
you can see here that it works totally fine
i was surprised that you didn't have to
i'm probably gonna keep plugging it into the wall anyway
but having that as an option is really cool
so that's great no charging or no batteries or anything just works right off
the bat can be powered by just the computer alone like we covered
and yeah the slim design makes it extra portable
there were fine but i was kind of like as i mentioned before
um it did fix when i minimized photoshop and maximized it again
i don't think i'd trust any of their newer tablets anymore
well they're they're newer monitor tablets like they're pros and stuff
so i'm probably gonna keep using it for a little bit longer
um i have to do some freelance animation next
i hope this has been informative for you
i think this is a pretty decent tablet again
i've only used it for a few weeks
um i'm gonna keep using it for a little bit
i'll update you guys later so uh thanks for watching
it's sorry it's a sponsored video but um yeah thank you
just move the other one in addition to that
I'm not going to be using that now
so tyd is the name it runs on android 6 which is the KitKat
take it down so it's nice and low but anyway alright now
I'm just gonna check to see whether there's any software updates on it
it's one of the first things you've got to do
get some videos to show you how to do
things get that downloaded put various others on as well and then we can
click onto that and again it brings up all the available
we've just gone to that not the best
you can put whatever you want on there
I was saying there was plenty of volume a little bit Timmy
I've got here the Lenovo Tab 8 10
I'm really curious to see what it has to offer
it's not gonna be a problem just by holding it
so so my first impressions are that it's a bit leggy
the frame rates look decent the overall picture
so it has a pretty decent sound quality for $100 tablet
it's not as loud as a more expensive tablet but it's a pretty decent
depends on the way you're holding the tablet
so that's that was really confusing to me at first also
it has like a pretty pretty big bezels
let me just take some pictures and see how they perform
it's a five megapixel camera on the back
so moving on to the thumb facing camera
I'm gonna take a picture so you guys can see the quality
it's really just a very low quality camera for FaceTime or Skype calls
I'm kind of blown away by the mic quality
I was expecting it to have decent cell quality and a decent screen
this would be a pretty good option for you
subscribe to the channel and I'll see you guys in the next video
it's not 1080p if not 2k it's not the most amazing display
I've seen but it does get fairly bright
it's in here which is awesome and then ports which also
you could put like a keyboard because they do have a version of this
that does have a keyboard that goes for 139
that's not all you also get a case inside of this
I'll talk about one thing I don't like at all and that's the sound
I can do a video on here 720 60 and you can see
so the the Wi-Fi is quick with it videos
let me just bring up another video of mine
there's no problems weird performance and trying to loading up videos
you can see the angles are really good awesome
I've noticed that gets a little funky on there and you can see it
you can make the window bigger or smaller
I'll play tag with Orion and subway surfer
who's just looking for something to watch videos on or do simple simple games
so let up subway surfer all right here
still the same there where you can get decent performance on this
I am not good at these games but I always say that
that's why ooh train come in doing really well is the best
click on his story so usually it works
if you're curious at the bottom you have a back button home
Google duo so you can do some you know chatting on this
you know and it's you can see there's nothing on here
check it out if you're looking for an expensive budget tablet
so this is a Xiaomi media writing tablet
let's actually use the tablet to talk about it so first of all right
read this just has the one button which
I have locked but I will not press because I'm too afraid
this tablet is absolutely no exception 13.5 inches so it is large
it's about this much shorter than an a4 and about this much narrower
I think it's exactly I checked it earlier
it's it leads the nice design so yeah
um she had the pen is completely passive is xiaomi branded
holy a dozen didn't have money for my okay at latches
sorry sorry-sorry pen also latches to other magnetics things but like briefly
this is basically the best part for it
that's it's it's not like it's easier to take off
its not gonna survive in a bag but it's good enough right
i think i'm not should i finished it's $23 including shipping
so i've written some some some pros and cons before that
let me actually zoom in right if you press super hard
I'm barely touching it right so I'm barely barely pressing down on it
I don't know does it get smudges when you bend
it doesn't so no pressure hotspots on the inside at least none that
I can immediately see or none that have developed yet
I mean Xiaomi does beautiful like nicely done stuff
I mean this is the biggest problem if somehow they could get that fixed
you have to cut it you have to cross it
otherwise you have to erase the whole and my
I don't know so it ends up being like that
yeah so contrast is definitely not a strong suit
I think there's others that have different colors or they just
there's a lock button right which technically now is set to lock
it's actually zoom in on this because everything done is everything like design wise
this is very beautiful right so lock and unlock and so now technically
I don't know I do enjoy you Kiki given that
let's write something on this habit display something so show me a writing tablet
I don't mind the writing experience at all
it is battery powered so this is a lot more kit than this
I love it this is how I do it
let's make it big and you have colors
you have black so you can go like this
I'll show you guys the colors so colors would would look like this
it is very nice so you have a bunch of tools right
you can't get finer pens right so this is basically the
you can't but again this is pretty powerful right so
I need to go back to a hundred no pinch to zoom
it's saying move doesn't work anymore and why the doesn't move work anymore like
I really would like to move stuff right and say that doesn't work
and you get this thing up here so that's always gonna be there
moving around is also pain in the ocean
I will say that at times it is a bit annoying
I'm sorry like if if you're watching this video and you still have Windows
I took some took some sketches for a YouTube video
I want to move right this little thing right
I don't want to move it to page three
yeah out of luck you can't and so
right eraser has also this like selection mode
charging port has a little metal reinforcement so again
that's very cute given that this is made of plastic
I'm I'm impressed by how well it's tucked together
let's just leave it at that and see it uploads the stuff it has
Wi-Fi I had some some talks with the support team
there's absolutely no way this is falling out and it's pretty expensive
I don't know but extremely well done and fits the table
it's a completely different use case scenario though so comparing them is
what's going on guys long hair from Android authority and good
Android tablets are hard to find and great Android tablets
it's bright vivid has great viewing angles and color saturation
sony has also made a big emphasis with audio on the z4 tablet
there's built-in high res audio support for reduced distortion and digital noise canceling technology
they're loud crisp and clear and don't show any signs of distortion
that's expandable up to an additional 128 gigs by a microSD
but some of them can be a lot of fun
you've also got the life log application which has become a standard app across
Sony's most recent devices and it's great for not only tracking your fitness data
allow you to play virtually anywhere you want in your home
this is definitely a huge selling point for ps4 owners
and there's also another version that comes with an included keyboard dock for 759
these prices put it squarely an Apple iPad territory
so what is it about the z4 tablet that makes it a great
and it's about time and om finally got it right as always guys
thank you so much for watching this video
if you did enjoy please give it a thumbs up down below
this is the 2020 version of one of whom's most popular pen displays
I needed to use sandpaper to get all the features working properly
Brad and I review tech for creative professionals people like you
illustrators designers at one-horse they taught to paint the hue on canvas
if you're new here you need a computer
this has to be plugged into a computer
hey bro additionally though this display can be plugged into certain
Android phones or tablets and used that way as well
I think we've reached a plateau and drawing technology in recent years
we've seen big gains in the line quality
we've seen big gains in the quality of the screens
I was to guess where we would go next
Blais to launch blazes ultimate game idea contest
can't program doesn't matter can't draw still doesn't matter
your game can be 8-bit 3d futuristic retro VR AR
there's violet purple midnight green and Cosmo black
I went with the Cosmo black and I kind of regret it
this isn't new but it's worth mentioning here
the screen itself has an anti-glare coating on it
it also provides a little bit of drawing resistance
feels good to use with the stylus and it's not too slick
I do get some check marks on really fast lines not something
I noticed when I was drawing just when I was testing it out
all of them seemed to work pretty well
I also tested on Windows and it doesn't look like it does it
Mac and I did test on two Macs both running catallena
just having one cable provide your power and your data in that HDMI port
I have a little bit of a situation here
that's the cable that came with my Mac for charging
it doesn't work for transmitting data and a signal so it jumped on Amazon
Huyen USBC cable and that's how I found it on their website
functionality isn't available for every device there's a list of compatible
you're gonna have to toggle on decks to get everything running well
decks turns your phone or tablet into a desktop like interface
now you can control your computer with your pen display
feels great to draw in but it doesn't go fullscreen
X can go fullscreen but it doesn't have any pressure sensitivity
it's painting app called hue on sketch which I reviewed weeks ago
fullscreen the winner from all of the art apps
I mentioned above like the apps not supporting it fully
it feels like a step towards something cool but the software and the hardware
it's just not there yet and for the canvas itself
I think that USBC cable is gonna be an issue
I really like a lot of things about it
it's just that when you get to those new features especially those Android features
thank you for watching and I'll talk to you a couple of things you
it is much cheaper because prices are starting at just $80
so how good can such a cheap tablet be
okay but actually that's mostly the end of me praising it
you will need it if you want to listen to music or watch movies
there's one single speaker placed above the screen and while it's loud enough
I don't think that's too much of a downside
IPS screen other aspects like color reproduction contrast and brightness are okay
well these are the options in some countries
I'm using the version was 1 gigabyte of RAM in the 16
Amazon fire 7 benchmarks like and to to the test
the performance is good enough for that reading
just don't have too high expectations while you can watch
HD videos in this case I noticed occasional legs when watching with this resolution
it is very disappointing that its performance is too weak for basic multitasking
there is no split screen view for example
if you want you can install the normal versions using the
in addition to those google apps are couple of standard ones pre-installed
but that's it since this is a super cheap device
I don't expect it to ever get Android 10 go
they know was pretty bad with updates in general still
it's a good decision from Lenovo to use
because operating system itself suman's quite smoothly by the way
alright let's get to the end of my
I can recommend it in a couple of circumstances
range the tab m7 has quite a lot of potential
it's very quality is fantastic and the screen and bed.you
more you can get much better performing tablets
a direct competitor is the Amazon fire 7
a 8.0 even though both costs around $130 you do get normal
all the opinions you're about to hear are my own
it is pretty much the same from a hardware standpoint
it's a mediatek mt6752 bytes and it also has 16 gigabytes of internal storage
but you'll notice the screen is very shiny
I don't like the dress products up here on the channel
I could say to the tablet here while it's off
it will do any of the echo commands
so for $79 you can get a echo device with a screen which
there's ways to get it on here but it's not all that consumer friendly
it's not something that a lot of consumers are going to do
this will take up to a 400 gigabyte card
last year's version topped out at around 200 gigabytes
you got a camera here on the back
so you could use wireless devices with it one thing
I've heard from people over the years is that sometimes
I don't think this will be any better or worse than prior versions there
when you're plugging in that charging cable headphone jack is right here
too with microphones built-in and you've got a volume rocker over there
even videos are popping up here without too many problems
and see how that streams up here so you can see by and large
it's not bad from a general browsing standpoint now
you'll notice some of those web pages really
and maybe act a little sluggish on this particular tablet
it's not going to be a speed demon if you are a YouTube fan
so what you're looking at here is essentially the mobile web version of YouTube
that just loads right up very very quickly here
because it's so tightly integrated with the device and its operating system after all
Amazon tablets are designed for you to be purchasing Amazon content
and they make that a very smooth process here
a lot of these are the same versions that you'll find on the other
Android platforms this is the Android version of Minecraft
Amazon turn on show mode and you can see here now
and now we have this persistent echo show interface
I would see if I had a echo show device what I'm noticing though
they sell a dock for about 40 dollars
turn off show mode and then it will revert back to that tablet interface
Amazon devices with a screen so by and large
I do recommend though from a performance standpoint
I think this is definitely something worth considering at
it's very reasonable $79 price tag until next time this is lon
Tom Albrecht Gerard Newberg in Cali an Kumar
it actually took a while to ship out
and if you're a regular viewer of the channel you know
they also offer a 128 gigabyte model at 299
you're also gonna receive some extra accessories that make this a real
Chromebook now this comes with the 64 gigabyte model or the 128 gigabyte model
so you will have to use this adapter over
it's got a decently sized trackpad given that we have a 10.1
I'm used to typing on a full-size keyboard
I'm really into the tablet aspect of this
the tablet uses USB type-c gen 2 for charging and syncs
X Ram like I said you can get these
in two variants 64 gigabytes of storage and 128 gigabytes of storage
unfortunately it does not offer a microSD card option
so you're gonna be stuck with what you have
the screen on the duet is actually really nice
Chrome OS and we do have access to Android apps
which is a big plus for a tablet like this
I mean it feels just like any other
I would go with something like the Galaxy
there has to be an arm hf version like here
we just have a touch interface when the keyboards detached so the first benchmark
this is strictly testing the CPU out over on the Left
we have the duet over on the right
OpenGL on the duet because it's not supporting Vulcan
and that'll definitely help out and games that support
and unfortunately this is the phone version of Netflix
I'm connected to my 5 gigahertz network and everything seems to work
I'm using the beta version so I can see the FPS
I personally love this game - the in-app purchases but I still play it
Call of Duty mobile and this is definitely playable on the duet
so it's pretty sure we'd have good luck with this one
my first impressions of the duet are pretty good
it's got awesome sound and we also have
do not pick this up but if you have to have
Chrome OS installed and you're looking for a cheap solution
I mean it's definitely not a tablet anymore but with the accessories removed
I think it's a pretty decent deal here
but that's pretty much it for this one
the innovator 16 is meant to be a higher-end version of the artist
XP pen tablet that they released last year
let's check out what's in the box when you open it
so we're gonna have the outlet adapters on the left there
little wiping cloth nothing too interesting in the other box here
we have the the cables so this is going to be the same
Hydra cable that you would find on the other tablet
I didn't notice any difference between the two
obviously is the look of it so it looks significantly different
it looks it looks better to me at least then
you also get the same film covering the screen
I'm not a big fan of that because it can get damaged pretty easily
it's a hundred and twenty five percent so not really any different and really
this tablet is just an almost identical clone of their previous model
but with a slimmer profile and a nicer design in my opinion
the height is a little bit less on the newer tablet than your model
I couldn't notice any difference now just to check
I could spot a slight difference but it is very slight slightly better now
so there's a slight slight delay in activation
at least that's what it feels like when using it
I was also slightly disappointed when I when I first got it that
it wasn't any more than 1080p but then against once
I found out that the price difference was only 50 dollars
there is not much parallax and it's very very responsive of course
though as you see me working here it wasn't really a problem
it's definitely not something that I keep thinking about as I'm working
I just can't draw because I forgot to charge the damn pen
not enjoyable very affordable though and this one here think
I'll have one myself and I just really hate using it
of course this is more of a personal thing yeah
it's a great build quality great technology and affordable
I get bug or something that makes it really annoying to use and here
I couldn't think of any to put in that section next
I'm going to place the innovator 16 in the context of this chart here
oh there it is so here very similar to its little brother
the main difference between the two here is that
it really depends what $50 is worth to you
I would probably take the innovator 16 over the artist
I just think it looks better for traveling and that kind of stuff
so in my opinion yes it is totally worth it
that's a little bit more premium kind of overall
I haven't mentioned that you think people shouldn't know about so
I hope the review was helpful all right
let me start at the beginning of this
doing what really not a convertible of course
include the full specs and on the blog post on the dish live.com
we've got Kensington lock we've got volume headphone
it's got a few things that the surface pro or my certainty
that's quite nice on the dot on the a
so that means you can plug your SIM card in and use it
it doesn't move right it doesn't push back
you can push right the way back on this
I think you could type reasonably quick on this
and there's a nice big trackpad that sports 2 finger scrolling things like that
but with this you've got the option of the trackpad and the three button
Mouse and the pointer it as well right spec wise
what's really good so it's a really good performing machine for that
it doesn't get too hot even even while playing stuff like minecraft
she'll have no problems doing like basic games like this like
I said you also will be able to do PowerPoint Office X
the 8 gig of memory should be plenty of performance
but you also be able to do things like video editing photo editing
so you can put the pen in like that
it was the best way we choose it with
put it into tablet mode all of that
I'm with word as well so we'll check that one thing
that's just create a new page one thing
but you could do if you wanted to
this one's at 2160 by 1440 very nice
we load something up and we can talk about that so they this group
this green is extremely clear and bright really vivid color reproduction
very sharp very clear with a good color
so that's a definite post on this device
very businesslike device it really is very comparable to surface pro 4
maybe even the surface book because the keyboard feels a bit more substantial
the surface book is more of a laptop
I guess but I very much like this
you wouldn't need another device if you're using this
so it's premium device premium prices but a very nice device
you can read more information on this on our blog post
are you in the market for a quality tablet

put them in the comments below until next time adding edition
we felt this product was worth our time
that is the pitch that hue ion is trying to make
I intend 60-plus is a direct competitor to walk
the tablet comes nicely packaged and comes with everything
say that the tablet is similar to the Intuos Pro M
we never had any issues getting the job done
which is the most important factor at the end of the day
the pen comes with a separate charging cable which seems a bit cumbersome
that means you'll have to carry the tablet's cable along with the
Hyun's website to get the most up-to-date version of the driver setting up
I kind of wished that it came with stickers
I'm not really quite sure where those are mapped on the tablet itself
but you got to play around with it for a bit
we did notice a bit of a delay
I love is the ability to use this in a split-screen setup
our answer is absolutely yes you can probably get a higher quality
it's really hard to not justify getting this considering the price
let me put this from a perspective of a youtuber such as myself
it is at the very least three to four times cheaper than what
if you like this video go ahead and give us a thumbs up
which is certainly steep for a consumer tablet now
Fujitsu sells us both to companies and direct online to consumers
you can buy it right off their website if you want so you know
corporate pricing does tend to be higher but still
we're not looking for cutting edge consumer resolutions here again
I guess you hear our volume controls as our microUSB port
I imagine overseas where you can get a 3g version of this up top
we have the power button the headphone jack
this is as vanilla and implementation of Android is you could ever see
it's just the standard stuff that you get with
well you certainly get it here our little control menus pretty much straight
if we go on the settings page you can see just basically your standard
it shred it's a very light clean implementation

that switchover becomes official when we go to jelly bean
then we'll check out a video see on that place okay
it on too close man works well and for video playback in viewing photos
mpeg-4 1080p obviously is higher than the resolution of the display itself
it plays just fine as the sound quality is pretty good too
it's not the loudest tablet on the market
distinctly better than average 8 megapixel camera takes sharp photos and good video 10
now we're in debt triggered and we can see tegra3 effects going on here
usually you don't get to actually see the water there
the tablet has a two cell lithium ion battery as usual for tablets

there's nothing there about the very basic google essential apps

that's Asus proprietary connector on the right side of the tablet volume rocker
a fairly sparse offering to be honest here
here is your sink in charge port and another small pinhole for reset functionality
and you'll notice that the tablet actually boots fairly quickly
it's a little bit faster than the average
windows user interfaces evolved and there's no question the
let's go ahead and go through those now
down here will always get you back to that
that will always get you back to the
you've got a Settings button you get devices
multitasking is absolutely a huge strength for Windows 8 and Windows RT
it now moves into a secondary portion of the screen
and what's more impressive as you can see right there
okay once we get that orientation it actually renders the screen
and so we've got here in the standard desktop mode here with Windows
but they're not using a lot of resources
but here we've got things like spotlight apps from pops eye
social media apps and as you can see entertainment photos music and video
we've gone ahead and installed a game app
engine as you can see pretty darn good especially in the tablet device
Hydro Thunder hurricane and that is currently available for $9.99 on the Microsoft Store
I have something a little different for you guys
huion a drawing tablet company contacted me about reviewing their newest graphic tablet
tablets are one of the most accessible ways to create digital art
i would say it's about 8 by 12 inches
you'll notice this tablet comes with a ton of express keys too
I actually love the express keys on the pen a little more
I cannot demonstrate that but I still think it's really really cool
it felt slightly more natural especially when I was using the pencil tools
the tablet was its color or their color that I chose the hs6
everyone stays safe and I hope you're doing well
here and welcome back to another video in this one
click enos to them which is really nice
this is just a color it does come in four different colors
so it's pretty nice that you comes with different colors now
I didn't like the footage but I'll I have all the things here
the next thing you get from bike normally
I don't know what this material is in this carrying case
I don't know if it's like suede or something
but it's nice little carrying bags very light
you get the pen itself which is completely battery free
it doesn't require any charging or anything like that
it has two buttons on it which is really nice the the only thing
obviously with every tablet you get you get a little glove from
is you get the Quick Start Guide in this little baggie
I don't know why it comes in a little baggie
all you gotta do is go to the website
download the zip file of the latest drivers
then all you got to do is just quickly
the mapping for what part of the screen that's gonna control the functions
you want to have it so that any time you open a Photoshop
Adobe Premiere or movie studio or DaVinci Resolve
it's a different set for each one of those
so that's really handy here a lot of times those
now if you follow me or you subscribe to me you'll notice that
don't get along rail because it's been so long since
it's a 10 by 6 inch work area which is really nice
you really can't beat this kind of quality you get the 12 buttons
really hit it out of the park with this one again
thank you guys so much for watching this video
if you enjoyed the video give it that thumbs up subscribe for more videos
leave comments below if you have this tablet
they've been very helpful for me with any questions
I've had make sure you leave a comment on anything
let's take a look at the things that I included
this is very nice to hold very well
the drawing area is about ten by six inches and the surface
it's matte which is really nice to draw on it
when you're turning it the overall look and feel it's very professional
alright let me show you what the driver can do
you can set mouse functions if you are using extended monitors or dual monitors
you can choose this option here to switch a screen
the whole drawing area has been mapped onto the whole desktop
the tablet can still be used for drawing so no worries
there has tested drawing performance so pressure sensitivity works really well the pen
let's take a look at the pressure transition
overall drawing of four lines here with MIDI Bank paint Pro
it's also very smooth this is Krita pressure sensitivity
I'm drawing with my mouse like what I'm doing right now
pay attention to the shape of the cursor right now
vertical tilt and pressure can work at the same time
and this is affinity photo pressure whoops here as well
lag that happens with other tablets as well pen pressure seems to work fine
nice let's take a look at that transition from thin to thick
and when the curves are turning it's also very smooth
and it's quite sensitive because the pen is sensitive so when a tissue
but that really is a problem with photoshop
though the illustrator pressure works fine and this is very responsive
unlike photoshop this tablet can actually be used with android devices
we don't have that where this phone where my other
I mean the this app that I'm using welcomed
bamboo paper is said to support tilt but somehow
they all don't work because there is no driver
you can customize the shortcuts you can definitely draw on
so sometimes for me to get a wireless connection to work
I hope that it can be recognized and it does work now
alright to conclude the design looks really nice
this tablet definitely gets a 5 out of 5 stars from me
that's really due to the optimization of cretan
Photoshop with MIDI band paint Pro and clip studio paint the drawing performance
you would have to check out a tax review
I'm not sure if I can recommend that this for me
it didn't work well with my android phone
Trung software rather than with Android so overall
it's a good product you can check out the pricing on my own website
link will be in the video description below and thanks for watching this review
could it be a useful tablet with that
I mange for my next table calm and in this
you will find out whether that is true or not
it is where we thick and weighs 272 grams on the right side
we get a power button and the volume controls
the tap e7 has a 1 single speaker which is located above the screen
its sound quality is kind of acceptable to watch some YouTube
I've got some other things to say about the cameras
we get a 0.3 megapixel front-facing camera and the 2 megapixel main camera
it is important to note that the Amazon fire HD 8 gets a noticeably
TF 7 essential let one worship to a standard Android instead of Android go
it is also important to know that this is not a multitasking tablet
apps get closed fast in the background and if you use
some of them might have to reload if you switch between them
I think that dude is a small RAM
that only happens when switching from another app or the home screen to Chrome
Ram and no the tap is 7 is not a perfect gaming tablet
either you won't be able to play pop
the lenovo tabby seven ships with Android 8.1
I don't think it will ever get em at 9 lenovo
usually it is transparent with the wallpaper shining through
the operating system runs smoothly and I like it quite a bit
it seems like at least the keyboard things that this is a smartphone
the keyboard is smaller than it should be on 7 inches
you can watch movies with us tablet without any issues however you cannot watch
that anyway said is not a big deer in this case inside
it does not lose much energy while in standby
Lenovo tapi 7 review and I've got to get to my final words
that is not that easy because it is very cheap
all of that runs smooth enough especially when you're not a power user
let's take a look at a couple of alternatives
a direct competitor with a similar price is the Amazon fire
7 the fire 7 and Lenovo type II 7 have almost identical hardware
UI and no Google apps are pre-installed with Lenovo
Google Apps manually but I think the value is much better here
i'm andrea for my next approach calm and I review pretty much
hey guys love and peace toons here and today
the pen itself is a bit thicker than the one and
I'm used to but it feels really solid and comfortable holding it
there's a smudge guard glove that fits nicely the cable is a 1 meter
I'm handling it so let's get this plugged and see how it performs alright
editing we are back with the drivers already installed loading up their configuration app
you can see your tablets model in the top left corner
you can also test your pressure sensitivity here as you can see
I'm pressing down harder and softer on the tablet
and you can see the pressure being indicated on the bar
of course you can see it all working just fine
I'm running a dual monitor setup when I was testing it
there was no need to restart or anything
and it's very simple so easy to use and now back to the hardware
I assume considering the fact that it comes with 20 replacement nibs
just fine at the time of recording this
I got some base colors in and started blending them all together
so there was a slight hiccup with the setup
the product is more of the website issue for the accessories
the material does not feel like very cheap plastic
oh man you're only paying 40 pounds for this
you get 14 buttons 60 inches of drawing surface 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity
I went on to do a drawing with it and this is what happens
in order to celebrate the 1000 subscribers let me know in the comments below
I'd love to hear your suggestions and yes I do read all of them
this is the Signature Edition meaning that it doesn't have any blower on it
they put quite a lot of effort on the package
the tablet is composed of a thin sheet of aluminum
the folds over with the subtle curves on to the display
so it's just a bit off which is equivalent to point 68 pounds
the microphone is placed at the bottom right side of the tablet
it has been recognizing my voice for 80% of the time hey
gigabytes and the tablet reads it just fine
gigahertz ban where this tablet falls short is in the sound
the sound on this is not that great when
I pump the sound all the way up
it is more suitable in a room where there's not much noise going on
it feels a bit uncomfortable to hold for a very long time
the tablet is very fragile and any drops will damage the soft aluminum body
another thing that may be a downfall is that the tablet doesn't get that
Al's for racing game works great on it which I'm playing right now
the tablet has an accelerometer gyroscope and GPS
it is not easy to play with my arms wrapped around the tripod so
I'm kind of sucking a bit right now
I'm not big gamers so I don't spend hours gaming on it
it does get a bit warm after a while using it
I have Word Excel publisher powerpoint and onenote on it
I'm browsing the web watching youtube videos and doing some light multitasking
so that concludes my experience with the new vision
fire tablets a good value but I also just picked up this and what
is this matrix pad a z4 is an Android tablet
the film remove threw them on the back of the camera
alright so hopefully this is all pretty straightforward now
looks like a pretty nice tablet and in fact
it's a little shorter but it's a little taller as well right so
I get a little bit more of a TV screen look
aluminum construction looks like we have the speakers on the back here
the camera right up there looks like there's even a flash
throw it in here on any of my
I'm not sure if that's a light or home port there it is
I can go powered by Android powering up and then so all
I just want to take a look inside the box
I will say I do like how light it is in my hand
and that's partially because little plastic and now how loud it's playing
oh maybe I don't know a little more solid me me but heavier
and so that's the trade-off and so you can see right here like
I said I mean you can decide right
do you want that wider or screen or though the largest thing
that is something you don't really have to sweat right
whatever so you want to pick up this matrix pad z4
I will put a link to in the description below Peter
hi everyone welcome back to my channel today
so this is the box of the tablet its model is 2
LPI resolution it went nine two levels of pressure sensitivity
I will show you how to use it first
these are the extra nibs for the pen
this is the user manual okay a Quick Start Guide
this is a small piece of cloth for wiping and clearing the tablet
let's see how it is so this is the back
let's see how the tablet fits in the bag
so the bar will move up like this
this is the pressure this is the pressure sensitivity adjustment curve
OK now let's quickly test it with Photoshop
let's do it with this tablet one more thing
I will provide the link in the description of this video
now let me show you the other side of this tablet
you can draw or write on it anything for approximately 50,000 times
you can write anything on it to make quick notes
if you like this tablet you can purchase it from the link which
I have mentioned in the description of this video
they're going to be sold for $30 extra
this is a nice contribution to the whole children's interactive media category and
let's not really open up this sealed box
there is an headphone jack and a charging port
and the power on button and at the back that is in pi
that's really good thing and it's charging are up sure
now let's test the sound quality of this okay
okay now let's check out the storage space almost 1
so that's it guys if you want a good chat with under 10,000 rupees
put sound quality and ease in camera 4
thanks for watching guys see you soon you
so it's 1280 by 800 so slightly over 720p display
see at this point so you'll still have to use that the other parts
this is just what it looks like on the back here
you get a camera as well at the top there
in this you will get bluetooth 4.0 you get a headphone jack
so if you want to plug in some headphones it's like
so close to the end of the tablet
it's all the way up there and then other than that
yeah let's get into the review of this tablet so first off
not that bad the viewing angles are pretty good as you can see
they're not the best but they're not the worst
it's it's just the video that I'm recording at
it's pretty the colors are actually pretty down and darn good on this
you can't make them play higher than 720p
it's a under $100 tablet it's literally 95 bucks right now on Amazon
it does a fairly good job at that
you know just loading up a video to play
it's again not too bad for what it does under 100 bucks as you
I think people play our game like this
that this tablet will easily handle and in literally a hard bucks
you can have a small little gaming tablet
it's nothing to write home about there's one I took with the front camera
they're both 2 megapixels on the front and the back again they're nothing crazy
if you're just you doing you know videos and really nothing else
this doesn't have it so at that point
I'll reiterate who this tablet's for it's for kids
it's for someone that wants a secondary tablet
I'm a huge fan of the surface pro
six in fact it was my favorite tune one of 2018 and
gen coming up wanna see more videos like this
subscribe button and make sure you hit that notification icon
what you're looking at is a 13-inch 3k IPS
it's powered by the Intel 8th generation cable 8 processor either the Core
terabyte of SSD storage and up to 16 gigabytes of ddr3
RAM it comes with a micro SD card slot and an optional
LTE which I recommend but enough with the specs
let's find out what you get inside the box
they give you the plastic pen holder as well
we'll get to that in a little bit
but it's good to see they throw that pen in the Box
it uses a smooth finish as opposed to the Alcantara
LTE SIM slot as well as a 3.5 millimeter
today's video is brought to you by lvl
with my 21 percent discount code twenty four dollars eighty nine cents
it's a little bit cheaper thirty-nine eighty-nine becomes 35 ninety
there watering is easy and safe head on over to lvl
the star of the show is it's gorgeous 13 inch IPS
that's a three thousand by two thousand resolution
you also getting a three by two aspect ratio
and it's a very bright display coming in at 415
it's certainly above the category average and one of the best in this category
it's great for both indoor and outdoor use
the colors are really vibrant and just seem to pop off the display
that's because this will be used as a tablet
the pen itself has 4096 levels of pressure
I didn't lose the pen and it stayed in
excellent key travel with the touchpad and of course that great rack point which
I think they did a fantastic job with it now
which is it really good especially when you compare to its chief competitor
it's actually pretty good eye for considering this is a two and wanna
this is a 1080p 30 frames per second and it's good for Skype
the rear facing camera is actually pretty good considering
I think they actually did a pretty good job
let me know now you do get a fingerprint scanner
that didn't get loud enough as I stated and I just wasn't impressed now
the good news is you do get a 3.5
this is actually a pretty good package so to wrap things up can
I recommend the Lenovo ThinkPad x1 tablet 3rd gen and the answers
there are no real deal-breakers unless you consider the battery life a deal-breaker
so what do you think about the lenovo
it's a 3k display no complaints on that front
it's got that excellent keyboard we've come to love with the ThinkPad line
performance was very good out of its eighth generation
KB Lake processor although I would love a refresh with the whiskey Lake processor
the rock solid build quality and the overall great looks
now speaking of the looks it is a major fingerprint magnet
don't forget to leave a comment in that comment section below
I'll do my best to try to make that happen
Facebook on Twitter Instagram and of course my website AMD Tech reviews.com
so until next time this is andrew from AMD tech see ya
we are doing a review on a tablet
and this is the series h6 of what it says on the amazon website
and also i've never seen this before as well
i had to read up on it because i thought what does that mean
which test the compatibility of google apps with the android device this baby
you can read on it take photos and do some painting
so that's about it there you go ips
what's that so activate your warranty visit blah blah blah
plus a minus headphones not sure what that is and connections
and what's this looks like a screen protector
i would say that was the screen protector
but that is very good and the manual
normally you'd like to see what all the connections are normally
don't worry so what else is up here your settings
let's see if there's anything else on it
so everything is there so you have a clock you drive which is external
bits some quick look assistant gallery blah blah blah
i'll have a quick look at that freaky
so we've got set up a chrome account
we're just going to test it out for now
so we've got to sort out the internet
click on this again and we should get something
i'm not going to do anything like that
i just want to see what does are you sure you want to close
there's a little bit of lag there but you've got to understand
of course we don't care right so we'll do my stream deck
it's going to give me a natural light
i see press play so you've got to bear in mind
that is a photo i believe so i took a photo
wasn't expecting it'd be fantastic picture quality on video and camera
the quality of the videos from youtube are excellent or any films
they are very good nice and clear as you can see in my video
i think like i said for the amount of money you pay
i think it's well worth that kind of money
definitely get my thumbs up on this and hopefully you like it
what you think about it i think like i said for 83 pound
i think it's well worth that kind of money
that that you can upgrade the memory to up to 128 gigabytes
it comes with a usb charger as a headphone socket
i think it's well worth the money so with that what i will do
if you didn't give us a thumbs down and please subscribe it's free
thank you very much for watching me you
what's going on guys the CTA praten back here again today
we're gonna be taking a look at and testing out the new tab m7
power switch and our 2 megapixel rear camera over on the left hand side
and when we put it up against the 2019
the m7 definitely comes ahead in the form factor
and the back is fully constructed of aluminum
now that's what we're gonna go over now for a $60 tablet
Android go an extra gig or even a half
Android we do have the Google Play Store right out of the box
even some of the lower end ones now
gigahertz Network because we can't pick up that 5 gigahertz but loading everything
up does take a little bit of time
it is pretty clear for what it is though so like
Wi-Fi chip that they chose to use in this unit
keep in mind this is Geekbench four and not Geekbench five
seven actually comes ahead in single and multi and the fire
I wanted to test out some native Android gaming pub G call of duty
even minecraft was a bit slow on this tablet and by the way
there'll be more assets on screen and the lag will get worse
we're getting a hundred percent speed-up in the top left hand corner
I figured I'd go ahead and test out ps1 now
see tab s6 but it's a really expensive unit
CPU I tested in a cheaper Android smartphone recently and performance was actually decent
G minecraft at full speed and not to mention emulation PSP Dreamcast PlayStation
I really appreciate you watching if you have any questions
does it ask for credit card details debit card details or any details whatsoever
so i'm not quite sure what happens after one year
uh do you have to pay like a small fee
this is the tablet itself seven inches on the back
there's the camera and that's the speaker you turn it on on the side
so let's turn it on voila so you're greeted too a wallpaper
now i've already created elias's account my little boys account now over here
you have a printer account you press it
i'm going to turn away or enter the password
there we go so i'm in now with this
so this first page is what we call stats
my boy hasn't really been playing that much
you can actually see what they have been doing
this is my little boys screen very simple again
the store is there so let's log into the store
it's called the game store and in here
we select categories and again learn books media now
they're missing oh there's only five but when you click on them
each one of these contain a number of books for definite so you see
it's all there and play of course fun
it's actually costs a bit of money on other platforms avalanche puddle
two's on here galagas on here special edition
let's go back to home screen all right so your games are in there
plus the books are fantastic for reading to him or her
hey let me just get a book up here all right
let's go for the frozen book movie all right
let me see if i got the volume on here
actually have you can actually listen to them talking
okay let me see if i can find a different one
um come on where the reading books actually do read to you
no he's not olaf is special because he sees the best in everyone
this tablet is fantastic for anyone that fears android devices or ios devices
they can cost a pretty penny and we have
they have no idea about quality price they have no idea about brands
no adverts nothing you can completely protect your child
i hope you enjoy that and i hope you buy one of these
pioneer finally released this 9-inch tablet and it's pretty cool
you can actually take it everywhere you go and it's pretty
it's nice to see a usb c port and mini hdmi
probably already wondering if you can hide the hardness behind the screen
now it's time to start our stopwatch for the boot time
you need to install car av assistant app on your phone
installed parking assist sensors swiping down on the home screen
i was expecting to be a little bit more responsive
but if you don't mind that then it's perfectly fine
pioneer is the best in class for doing so
the graphic design because makes it very easy to understand
what's going on and take for example time alignment
please let me know in the comments and in the communication settings screen
we have a bunch of basic connectivity options
wireless apple carplay and android auto which is pretty pretty good
it doesn't cost you anything and it's always free
i'm nathan with the ebookreader.com for this video
so i reviewed the first one back in 2017.
it's nice to see they've updated the design quite a bit
it's much thinner and it just feels like a more premium device
it's got an aluminum frame and it's very thin
it comes with a stylus for writing on the screen
actually there are two different options for the stylus
there's a white one and a black one
they have the same kind of feel to them
so the remarkable is designed as a note-taking and writing device
uh so here's kind of a look at the different
uh you can have like your main view of listed files right here
you can send files as well a required internet connection
but it doesn't have like a web browser anything like that
go through the remarkable account so it does require remarkable count
so let's go ahead and load up just the regular pencil so it supports
you've got three different colors obviously the white
uh into you know typed text so it does require an internet connection
uh but then you know it works pretty well
it's more accurate than onyx's uh conversion feature
i was kind of messing around with some different things here
so let's talk about the interface a little bit more again
the top to add new folders new notebooks new quick sheets
i'll show you a couple of different things in here
it does support a number of languages for that handwritten conversion feature uh
you can write notes on ebooks as well
so you got like the freehand highlighting here
so it's a little bit different than your you know
it's a little bit more basic but you got to understand
it doesn't have any like inverted mode or anything like that
where you can send web articles to the remarkable to read them reformatted
it doesn't seem to work quite as well but it is an option
i would like them to have a contrast darken feature
but it doesn't because as you can see here
so here's just a listen to the sound difference
this is the older ipad though with the uh original apple pencil
i don't know how the newer one is and another advantage with the ink
direct sunlight doesn't phase it at all ipad full brightness
thank you guys for watching check out the ebookreader.com for more info bye
I thought having a non IPS display wouldn't be a problem
well put and it's easy to take off too
you can also place an intent mode and tablet mode to suit your need
there wasn't much of a delay when typing except one backspacing
sometimes there's a capacitive touch pad on the bottom and it's okay
it may take some time getting used to at first
you can use two fingers to scroll up or down on a page
it's made of just plastic all around and it's pretty thick and heavy
the tablet is packed with mediatek 1.3 gigahertz quad-core processor
Mally 450 MPEG pu and it's near stock android 6.0 marshmallow
the tablet runs smoothly when lightly browsing the web
there wasn't much of a slowdown especially with 3d games
more graphic heavy games ended up being slow and shoppi
one of the best things about this tablet is its battery life
size does matter and the keyboard is suitable for almost anyone for $100
I'll have links down in the description and as always thanks for watching you
hey everyone this is a review for the here on campus
besides the important things you also get pen nibs and a screen cleaner
this is what the monitor looks like on my desk
the screen is big and has a variety of colors
the pen is comfortable to hold and easy to use
the holder isn't really a necessity but as I often lose my pen
you were also given extra pen nibs if your pen gets too stubby
the stand that comes with the table is not attached
loaded the g21 nine driver and not the gt1 nine one version two driver
I thought my monitor wasn't working after downloading a driver
the transition from drawing tablet to monitor was so smooth
drawing on the monitor is easy and really fun
it's nice to have such a big screen to zoom into details
partial options are also a lot more self-explanatory and understandable in comparison to where
I can't carry around and start up work
I expected but I can't alter alternate alternate our script okay
the problems are encountered which a few can be easily words around
this is a monitor and not a tablet
personally this will only be a problem when
I don't use the Wacom tablet at home now
Windows so if you're planning on using only using the monitor screen
it may be a problem if you want to type for improvements
I would add an eraser to the end of this pen
I think it'd be cool to have the pen connected
it also works well with paint tool sai and Photoshop
I've used it with non drawing software like Camtasia Studio Google
it runs like a computer with a pen
I want to thank you one for this opportunity for viewing that tablet
it's been an honor to use and review this tablet and
I hope you get to try this amazing product
i am your host ty in today's episode
i will be revisiting the lg g pad 5 10.1 tablet
i'm going to give the device a proper overview
so let's kim and keep it moving into the video as usual
299 green stamps but hold up buster me
the lg g-pad 5 has a simplistic but functional design
and i love it when engineers fuse metal into their devices
the lg g-pad 5 does have an aluminum back
there is a 5 megapixel camera on the back side of the g pad
5 there is an 8 megapixel camera and just out of pure curiosity
i managed to grab some footage with this tablets camera
the sim tray along with the sd card is located on the left
now this is not the fastest fingerprint sensor
i've used but it works and it works
the g-pad 5 has a 10.1 edge-to-edge full hd lcd display at 1920x1200
the display is crisp with a decent amount of brightness
some photos some light gaming on a larger screen
let's see what the software is all about
the device is running an overweight version of android 9 aka
moving the device has a 8200 milliamp hour cell
you guys can keep it all right keeping it moving
the lg g pad five floors is a quad core snapdragon 821 processor
this processor was the to have however in comparison to today's processing power
the snapdragon 821 is a good mid-range processor
also the g-pad 5 has expandable storage up to 512 gigabytes
i've got to mention this real fast before i continue folks
32 gigabyte tablet to edit my short videos
for that the lg g pad 5 will cost you
alright folks that is a wrap for the lg g-pad 5 10.1
it really does help out the channel and also consider subscribing
8.1 tablet with office 365 as well now
and you're ready to go of course it has
it also has bluetooth for external headsets keyboards and other accessories
so let's take a look at the tablet in greater detail
there's nothing else remarkable about the front if we turn it to the side
first thing you'll see at the top is the power button
I'm pleased to see there's a an SD card slot
this thing supports up to 32 gig card slot to the manufacturer
then you see the headphone jack to the right and then another
there needed to be a place for the antennas
so as you'll see there i have the google play store
i can look at apps and see what apps are available
i can go to the free section and obviously as you can see
part me hour battery life and I can honestly say that
so they're of no use to me unfortunately along with that
this is a two and a half half charger
let me pick this one up for just a second
I haven't tried it so I can attest to the functionality okay
so let's look at this thing in operation a little bit more
I want to take you over to the gallery
I want to show you some impressive photos here
I'm going to turn this to landscape mode
the gallery really does show this device off
display turned down because it overpowers the camera
you know the responsiveness of this thing is just been amazing
it is never stalled or stuttered or giving me one glitch whatsoever
that's your iPad air in an Android tablet
as a matter of fact overall the tablet has done nothing but impress me
you'll see a row of buttons down here
you'll see a row of buttons toward the bottom here
button your back button and your background apps running button
this is a screen capture button so it automatically captures your screen for you
and then there's a menu button down here which in certain situations provides functionality
it doesn't provide any functionality in the home screen
ok folks you could go out and spend two three or even four times
by saying the gear best is brought to droidforums.net an impressive array of products
but a whole plethora of other gear that would be worthy of your consideration
they have everything from phones to tablets to accessories
I suggest you at least take a look at their offerings
this is fox cat signing off and remember to visit the gear
best thread at the link below thank you
Windows 10 came out as for the installation CD
not including the stands which is quite big
the act of drawing area is fifteen point nine inches by 10 inches
the tablet has 2048 levels of pressure as well as 5080 lines per inch
it's very customizable and sturdy at every angle
I went ahead and used a DVI input to experience the best quality
that's one of the few things that really dates us over
the tablets display leans towards a cooler tone when set to default
that is only noticeable when zoomed in and
I will show you a comparison between the monitor and tablet screens
I thought this would bother me while working on it since
I'm typically used to matte screen protectors but I was pleasantly surprised
the group wasn't there but I didn't really miss it
I also found that the display did not easily scratch
I personally love the design weight and feel of this pen
it's very similar to the comp ends with a raised
the weight of the pen is towards the tip
making it very comfortable to draw while the tablet is upright
the nibs have some gifts but feel sturdy
the pen is hold a charge for a good length of time since
Photoshop and I didn't have any trouble with pressure sensitivity or straight lines
the lines are very fluid and easy to control
jitter on the diagonal lines which is great and I didn't just go
it looks like you can't change those buttons to a keystroke at all like
well it's a little bit older than most on the market
thank you all so much for watching you
The first thing that pictures don’t show you is that the Surface is big.
Windows button which works like the Windows key
The rear camera is tilted downward which takes a bit of getting used to
but seriously don’t take pictures with a tablet.
and on the right is the charging port, USB 2.0 and Micro HDMI.
RT runs extremely smoothly practically everywhere in the OS.
at which point the tablet slows down considerably.
The Surface RT runs Windows RT which is Windows 8 for ARM processors.
At times the Surface feels like a glimpse into the future
The price is really where it hits home.
The Surface RT starts at $499 for 32GB
Compare that with $399 for the Nexus 10 and $499 for the iPad 4
Anyway guys, I will catch you in the next one!
japan trusted collagen supplements in japan and para malama benefits subscribe
many of us are wondering why we should take a collagen supplements
so i'm going to show you this chocola bb
i think you're already familiar with this product
long an aparramanding good for two months depending is good for
i know 40 days and guys madaming 85 30 30 40 and up
yeah and ingredients okay so we have now here
mg niacin 25 mg pantothenic acid 10 mg and collagen peptide 600 mg
skin repair strengthens the skin barrier and boasts antioxidant levels in the skin
hydration helps fades carrying and improve evenness of the skin tone
pounds making it a bit heavier than most the tablets that are out there
the one nice thing about this tablet is at the back
the biggest downside towards this tablet is its overall shape
it's extra long kind of shape doesn't really make sense
one of the best things about it is its functionality
side of the device contains a small locking switch on the opposite side
now let's get into some of the serious stuff in terms of technical specifications
this tablet runs an nvidia tegra 250 processor
which is clocked in one gigahertz and has one megabyte of l2 cache memory
and it's capable of replicating 16 million colors in terms of how this display
i managed to get an average of six to seven hours of battery life
i'm sure you can get better if you monitor
how many things are running in the background
it has a good management system for you to do that
keep in mind that this tablet does also run flash
if i had to complain with anything i would say that
currently the toshiba thrives comes in three different versions
you have the age 16 and 32 gig versions
the nice thing is thanks to the sd card slot
you can take a standard hdmi port directly connected into your tv and directly
if you can slim it down make it a little more linear
i think this is a fantastic tablet device
so thank you so much and we'll see you next time take care
don't really tell you so without further ado
Wacom Bamboo capture tablet the included software with the Wacom
is the additional like tools that you have inside
Photoshop let me go ahead and click one of these really quick
there is no no wireless included with the bamboo
US dollars one thing you do want to note
they had some neat stuff with the screen
it's got a 1920 by 1080 display really good viewing angles on it
it's one of the new fan list chips from Intel
but it has 8 gigs of ram and a 256 gigabyte
and it'll almost dock itself it just snaps into place on its own
I thought was a very disturbing decision here
what they have done is put in one of these little pointer
the screen will translate all of that motion
you have a volume rocker up and down
you have a power and standby button as well as a micro
SD card slot for putting on some external storage
this actually does perform quite well the core
well we're gonna take a look at that now
I should note that the speakers are in the front here
I think it has wireless AC onboard and it definitely supports the 5 gigahertz
Wi-Fi yet does have AC and supports 5 gigahertz channel
so you're gonna get some of the newer
Wi-Fi access points working with this without issues next
I go but you can see though it does
it is able to make adjustments on the fly here very quickly
give or take when you're doing basic work tasks like productivity
Core M machines at this price point because are gonna perform about the same
Windows tablets running the full version of Windows 8.1
here and over the past couple of days
I've been asked a lot about the Nvidia shield tablet
a lot of people are buying this specifically for the gaming features
and it's really good at that but if you know me
I'm really not much of a gamer at all
let's take a look so first of all this
it's got a pretty standard array of ports headphone jack
this is one of a few tablets just a few with front-facing speakers
they're really stiff and have almost zero travel
there's dedicated software hub and everything but like
Android with a few Nvidia improvements and I really like that
I put the Google experience launcher on here
Android with no skin and that beastly NVIDIA k1
so it's pretty sharp but again the panel is just mid-range
I fired up an application that honestly on any other
Android tablet lags and stutters and drop streams like crazy and that's Google Earth
almost zero dropped frames beautiful fluid movement might actually finally be the first
yes they added a stylus to the back of this tablet
it's like a felt-tip pen and it kind of rocks
NVIDIA has added to the stock Android experience was some performance modes and
HDMI settings since there's a mini HDMI port
so that's a good sign for this new tablet
I think they'll also get a few software updates maybe see Android L soon
you know what those rumors of an 8-inch volantis
thanks for watching guys and I'll talk to you in the next one peace
I picked one of these up and I tuned my car with it
let's talk about a huge huge outfit in the room
the short answer is yes but more power is a little misleading for contacts
this is exactly where the more power thing comes from
when you're flooring it you hit 3k rpms
the car is so much more fun to drive but now moving on
and that's the point as you can see a new open
and seventy five abducts six hundred seventy five dollar price tag comes from the
I just don't think it's worth it and an even better news
you might not even have to pay five hundred dollars for your open
I picked mine up for three hundred and fifty dollars
just a few other things before we go on discuss the things
I don't like about the tune the tablet
shell just feels cheap for five hundred dollars brand-new
open it up with the software download the actual tune file
coding which leads me to my next point
it's clunky it's outdated and it's a pile of talk garbage
you have to go on their confusing website
and don't get me started on if you want to
I recommend the open flash tablet yes I would
my car's torque tip is almost completely gone so just putting it out there
this is their debut version and right now they're currently on the version
it writes faster but it doesn't actually affect the tune file itself
I'd like to hear what you guys think
feel free to ask in the comments below
I'll catch you guys next time peace out
it has 8192 levels of pen pressure to ensure that your lines look crisp
oh and bags for all of those things
the cool thing about this tablet is that it also works with android phones
i use when animating basically i'll just be showing you
i bet you'll never guess what character we'll be animating
yeah now let's get started first things first
i almost always have a pretty clear idea of what i'll be doing before
i even put my pen on the screen
i always start by sketching out my key frames
stage is lay out the motion or action
make sure everything's consistent and then go back to add features along with this
i didn't sketch a background here because the background was already drawn for this
then you'll know what to use later on a tip
for making your animations look real nice is to animate on an arc
it's time to start adding some more structure
you don't have to fill in every single frame
it will save time if you pick and choose
but they turned out to be really useful
you can set your shortcut keys to common buttons
that's what i did and it was worth it aside from all the shortcut
keys this tablet's quality is great for the price
i also have an iphone so i can't really use it anyway overall
if you're in the market for a new tablet i totally recommend it
it might be a little bit confusing for beginners though
your animation will look nice and smooth even if the drawing itself isn't perfect
you'll be left with this little gap here
invert the selection and erase out the part of the gradient
it's actually two-sided i'll show you the other side in a minute
you can program the area to be smaller if you want to
but you might want to change the orientation to portrait
perhaps to do that way you can change to pen
let's get a little close up on that one
so they've got a top button and a bottom button
i'm in there so it's not gonna work on there on the bottom
i've got shift e which is a raise on the software so with this
um colors already organized so you basically just start drawing
so let's get that and then bucket fill
we need to get the color picker back and then pencil
but it's can i fill that in there
we go look at that and let's just do a bit there
oh there no no undo undo there now we're getting somewhere okay
i think that was like a quick one
i've drawn it better before waiting just a little bit there
that's obviously a quick jobby and obviously you can
i just wanted to show you how easy it is to do
this one i think is is called the practice side
you can fill up the whole screen look for bread and then delete it
you do all your good stuff on here
it's probably gonna be an amazon affiliate link um and okay
then we've got a power button volume up and volume down as well
there is nothing on the sides and then on the back
we've got this rubberized back over plus the 8 megapixel camera as well
then we've got the digital and well being parent course parental controls
we've got the storage manager which will remove some apps
sorry pictures and videos if it finds that we don't browse them anymore
obviously the font size ended display size is fully adjustable to your liking
but that's that when it comes to recording video
Mouse support something that Apple just recently released with their iPads
it is a full-blown word as well which works really
how many characters you've got in your text as well
I have to admit for the price you pay
you can create documents on it you can edit
you then game on it ends because the second 10 inch device it actually
so yeah thanks for watching out there episode of quick expert reviews and
I'm Erin from tech gadgets Canada calm and the Amazon fire
it's bigger than the 8 and it has a more widescreen format
I don't know how well you're gonna be able to see that there
it's got better resolution a more powerful processor
well the 10 here allows for 32 and 64 gigabytes
the 10 definitely faster than the 8 though
I couldn't get it to work at least this time
but the voice control option wasn't working and nor was show mode
it might be a big drawback for some shoppers
the speakers on this tablet get pretty loud
I quickly added Spotify YouTube Netflix in - Graham Twitter and Google keep
so using that app is a bit of a mystery
I also couldn't see things like Canadian banking apps or Canadian news apps
and you demand responsiveness and a slight lag
that helps us keep making more videos that we hope everyone out
there can watch enjoy and learn from until next time
find me on twitter and instagram at aaron ly
YC you can also find me on facebook comm slash tech gadgets canada
you might ask why would I get this instead of a Cintiq
there are cheaper larger tablets out there like the
Huon 18 inch but with a lot of those tablets
the quality is hit or miss after using this tablet for a few weeks
I haven't used the latest Wacom 13 inch
so that's going to give me a little variation in this review
it feels solid the screen and the quality
the buttons are much better than I expected any of the cheaper Cintiq alternatives
that are out there right now have some flaws to them
you'll find things like dust under the screen or dead pixels
the hardware buttons along the side are mapped to things
I missed was being able to pinch in order to zoom in and out
having a real scroll wheel dedicated to that
the included stylus was much lighter than what
there's a little bit of resistance to the screen
Wacom that matte surface seemed to dim the screen
a lot of those types of things like the pressure sensitivity is also adjustable
not because of the pen and that's the way it should be one thing
the stand is an extra fifty dollars but it's kind of Awesome
yep now I got the drivers up and running on both Mac and Windows
it's not going to work on the surface tablet that's okay
I had some Wacom drivers installed but I didn't actually notice any conflict
Pixelmator that I was playing with on the Mac less than other programs
El Capitan never gets old when I first took it out
my hand just didn't feel quite right on the pen screen
who knows maybe my hands were just filthy
you can definitely tell it there is a
I want to call it a gap but the gap
and you definitely tell that it's offset from the screen
this is a great device often times when you look at
I've ever used so if you want to learn more
I will see you in a few weeks you
hello internet world and welcome to my review of the veek vk 1200.
this is a pen display or graphics tablet with a really good ips display
this was very kindly sent in free of charge by the manufacturer
so this is what you get inside the box
this is really nice very very comfortable to hold nicely tapered at the top
but normally i'd have this lane flat on the desk now
the vk 1200 measures 318 by 289 by just 12 millimeters thick
that's worth noting so you don't have to charge this
that you're using of course within the application also worth noting
they've done a great job on how this pen interacts with the vk
why would you want a graphics tablet or a display like this
well you can of course get graphics tablets that allow you to do drawing
you get some disconnection there being able to draw directly onto the image
let me just change colors here just so you can see a bit clearer
it's just a fantastic experience being able to draw direct onto the display
i've really been impressed with is the price point on the vk 1200
i can certainly highly recommend it of note
that's on the pdf manual available on their website
if you want to pick up a vk 1200 for yourself
there are links down in the video description
there's also a link down there to the veek website
it's essentially like drawing on a business card as I said earlier
and whatever you want it's all set up through the
meaning you can only use the side of the pen with a nuke
it's a large cone and a little less springing
and it came with a few extra nibs
whenever you buy the tablet the last thing is the court
I'll go ahead and give it the biggest drawback the dragger
so that's a big part to take into account
I captured while drawing with it on my PC
I admit I'm pretty spoiled by my team to his pro
when it came to details in color it was great
the pen has a nice weight to it
Sai and Medibank paint Pro so all in all
maybe not unless you have the patience to get the drivers working
I wish I could have gotten my first tablet
this isn't the only cheap tablet out there though
this is just a smidge bigger than the
Beyond but lacks three buttons on the side
thanks for watching and I'll see you next week it
but they're releasing their first tablet and that company is named senslab
when you open up your sense labs tablet
i want to start off with the carrying case
the section for the tablet does have a nice silky cushioned
that's going to protect your tablet on the go from there
you also get three shortcut keys on the top
and you can customize them to your heart's content from there
so this is a huge benefit for me
and then you can diagnose and see how heavy your pen pressure is
the drawing experience is a lot better on the sense
i think what senselab did here is amazing
i'm excited to see what they have coming down the pipeline in the future
they are coming out with a display tablet
this might not be in your price bracket and that's okay
like i think this feels better than anything
i'm gonna end it here for you guys
like and subscribe and i will talk to you guys later
good day good weekend have a good life guys
and this is my review for the tech class p80x android tablet
the box is no more or less than the essentials
i'm going to skip showing you the formalities of the setup process
i've reviewed quite a few products in my time
but this is the very first tablet review for me so i wondered
i ran and at the end of the video
we have geekbench running here which is a well-respected benchmarking application
i'm not running this clip in real time
any small text or images can be enlarged with multi-touch screen gestures
i have to say i did know that
hello this is simracing corner and this is my review racing um to me
you'll need to excuse my bad gameplay as it was a difficult filming angle
he was standing too close to a power conduit from the laser blockade
watch out the security guard has just activated what sorry
luckily it doesn't have any orders concerning you so it let you go
that's all the game testing over and finally testing the camera
it's really snappy everything i've thrown at it runs great
millimeter jack to plug in your own headphones
read the user reviews on the banggood product page
i think what tech class have done here is really good
and i think they've really managed to do this very very well for me
it's the right price for a good all-round performer
hello youtube today is Saturday februari 20th 2016
World Congress actually starts but that's okay of course I can do that
and as you can see it is pretty nondescript
I read somewhere some I possibly Albert Einstein
Cree do because this is very very dialed back and muted
basically it's just a as you can see a black rectangle up here
you have a sony logo and an xperia logo
you have nothing but this plastic edge surprisingly not very scratched
you have the volume rocker and the volume
that came out with a set three phone so that works very well
because if you hold this your hand will probably cover the speakers
I don't know why they put to speak is down here
there is a very slight lip on the plastic
the surface is fraction of a millimeter above the the
I weighed mine the other day and it was 370 grams
i have a magazine of the kind i usually buy when
I'm traveling I don't really know why i buy these
the magazine is tiny tiny bit thinner and they also
I can only read whatever they written in this issue
so set for tablet is it is better than a magazine
screen triluminos display with x-reality engine triluminos and x-reality are basically buzzwords created by
inch quad HD which means 2560 by 1600 pixels
so it's pretty high resolution and it looks absolutely gorgeous to me
I don't know it was because of the overheating problem
it never had any problems with overheating or stuttering or anything like that
millimeters and this version weighs in at approximately 375 grams
the LTE version is slightly heavier but still not very heavy at all
if you're doing that you're doing it wrong
so those are the specifications of the set for tablets
this is the Xperia set for screen as you can see
HD 10 inch displays and it is pretty nice
it is what sony call a triluminos display
but if you go and talk to erica griffin
i'm sure she can tell you all about it
it's sufficient to say that it is a very nice screen
it was basically perfect out of the box
I never had any reason to feel with those settings at all
it's got the Snapdragon 810 SOC which is a very good cpu or SOC
it came out when it first came out
they had a lot of problems with it
because it overheated and it also overheated in
Sony's said 3 + / set for phone but with this
I'm saying that now but it's not available for Android all right here
I haven't actually played this for some time
I think it's just going to one of these
I wish there were more games like this
I don't really like the racing games and stuff like that
I need from my tablet in terms of power
it gets a bit warm ish up here in this area
LaVista deadly you enter the world of pain burn
I can't help but wonder what should suddenly do to improve on this
of course they can make it bigger or smaller
they can change the vessels because the vessels are quite distinct in
it's not going to make a big difference
I don't think that will make much of a difference
the same goes for the chipsets if they upgrade from the 810
it's nice but it's not that big a step really
these days they try to make it close to stock
because they couldn't really get any better than the said
I think they're in the same situation with the tablet
they can't really do anything more to it making it
they tried adding the fingerprint sensor for the set 5 phone
in my opinion that wasn't very successful kind of ruined this very nice
so hmm we'll certainly pull out of the tablet the sea possibly actually
I think it's possible that they will at least take a timeout
and say we're not going to do this for a while
due by the cell phone tablet it is a very good tablet
you know everything in tablet is all about
then you should probably take a look at that because
it becomes pretty apparent that you know you can upgrade the SOC
the apps are not made to be multitasked in android
you can't even see them in the PlayStation Store
the thing is though playing xcom enemy within on this works brilliantly
it is a good platform to play that game
I think we need to see for tablets to you
then why should you pay extra for this
I think that tablets are even phones are diminishing in sales these days
yeah the business is in a difficult position right now
I think you need to start looking at the software
hey guys peter here with judy bridge calm
here's some specs you can read on the back
sorry about the reflectiveness woke up because it is a flush screen of bezel
the back kind of has its own personality
you see that you have a center eyes camera
that's awesome camera as I said you don't have a light package
a hard reset button and a dedicated microUSB port
the front is flush screen a bezel with a camera on the front
we're going to go to nuke audiobooks here
a cat at the foot of your bed is on fire
you can plug this into your headphone jack auxilary jackal via the headphone jack
in your car and you can listen to stuff that you go
so it's kind of like a filler app
we're on a web browser now and you can do shopping from there
look library is where all your stuff is actually going to be
this will be your books your magazines your little kids books everything
I'll grab the top corner of the page
in that regard you have text size changes
everything changes live for the most part you have margins line spacing justification
jump to page add bookmarks find in book view details and settings
just kind of like your feed and then at the bottom
nuke shop is where you actually buy your content
more in the series editorial reviews you can do review and click
what do you think lots of cool stuff here
you can also click free sample if you want to do that
it's better than just reading the table of contents
cool you can zoom in on that you can double tap out
it's not worlds apart in size so the screen size
the the tablet itself is capable of a lot of things
it's also expandable up to 128 gigs via SD card
they got this cookie cutter black layout they
I haven't changed much in the last little while so
I'm glad they went back they got Android 6.0
there's a lot to cover for nook stuff trigger e-reader comm this is Peter
it's a monitor that needs to be connected to a computer to work
it's a little over a kilo which is quite light
you can use and set up as shortcuts in there is also a rotating
you just need to be loft a protective layer
that's always so satisfying suiting to do like
I love peeling off labels and stuff like that
you need to know what's happening in the back
you can't do it because you can't screw it in
so it's good but it's a little tight
the pen is the classic camel pen design
Gambel pen nibs get worn out pretty easily
I don't know if it depends on the screen protector or the tip itself
I don't know a thing you like a lot about
this tablet is that they reduce a lot
the amount of wires a usually gamin pen display tablet
so it's nice that they reduced them so it's great for portability
you just need to go through their website
you have to press for a few seconds
took me a while to figure that out the ring
you're using and one makes you scroll up and down
the layers of the display are glued together
the lamination of this screen is really good the parallax it's barely noticeable
but it's not 100% precise and it's worth mentioning that
the pen is very responsive as always and alike
I have a very old laptop as you might know
that doesn't work really well because of that
before was the comparison between the other fifteen point six inches display tablet
I am trying to experiment with ways of coloring especially digitally
I haven't made a watercolor illustration since the beginning of the year
hey can you believe that it's crazy anyway
I think I worked everything at the end
it looks like it just made a mistake and I mean Anatomy
I feel quite confident about the female torso but everything else
also you know guy said his channel started with me only making
the problem is that I forgot everything in you
thank you so much for watching and I hope you're all safe
it's time to add some more power for this
that you just want to run on e85
you'd use the stage 2 equal length header tune
we decided to start off with the stage
1 tune writing a tune to your vehicle takes about 5 minutes
let's talk about how the stage 1 tune feels immediately
really this is how we think the BRZ should feel from the factory
but it's very brief and much improved over stock on the stock tune
we'd say we're really happy with the car just on the stage one two
it does provide a much more enjoyable driving experience
then pull over and flash the ECU to the e85 tune
it's an easy process and only takes about 10 minutes
so you're breaking even if not saving money at the pump
it's our first time drifting ever so go easy on us
now you may think that because he's got a mobile processor
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how fast the laptop actually is
hdmi displayport so unfortunately this one there is no wired
Boots's straight into windows ready feeding used so there we go
you're at your Windows desktop so it comes with Windows 10 professional
you'll be able to see that it is very fast
it loads within seconds again we can use the touchscreen
Windows 10 do you want the tournament's tablet mode
it can be used as a replacement for a laptop
if you have any questions or comments please post them in the comments box
hi everyone this is david from geek enoyed
I'm bringing you a review of the Wacom Bamboo fun pen and touch
I'm going to be showing you on screen
let's look at the system preferences for this bamboo pen and touch tablet now
we can configure the buttons on the pen the eraser feel double-click distance etc
and then we can configure the tablet itself either left or right-handed use
I can actually configure what each button does at
it still work with the pain but just won't accept a touch input
you can tap with one finger as I've been doing already
I was on so very useful for actually navigating around a browser
I'm viewing so I can double click to view this photo
it takes a little bit of getting used to that first
it is usable as a proper graphics tablet as well
Thunderer pen and touch features in one device is a very welcome addition
then you're going to pay around about 155 pounds
this is bottom in my review of the
come back soon and check out more reviews and geek annoyed scout UK
this video review is sponsored by crucial the memory experts they provide reliable
recently I was contacted by a spokesperson from a company called Galman
they offered to send me a free fancy-pantsy tablet in order to review it
doing a basic review wasn't really gonna cut it for me so instead
so it's quite the upgrade from my huion h6n pro the gigantic package
the goal is to make flaming knuckles a little more unique first
I started by pulling his dreads into a ponytail
have these sort of markings on their face and dreads dr.
you know red fur a slightly darker tan muzzle
I made the Lego base and the shackles a sort of silvery gray
I've heard this is actually kind of normal with screen tablets anyway
I'm definitely going to use this tablet way more often
if you're looking for a good screen tablet
I left links in the description of where you can buy it
that has nothing to do with any sponsorship
some of you might actually already know what it might be
I hope you look forward to that and I'll see you guys later
hey guys it's neon and I'm here with pinky boo
yep let's flip this over there we go okay
let's get started like the walking one to your computer
install the way is drive and register your tablet
so let's see what we got in the box
yeah why don't you take it you all compared to the other ones yeah
well we're gonna get pinky boo using this tablet
I don't know this is a yes stylus is
so we're all going to hook this up
there's our instructions we're gonna hook this unit up yeah
I like how they hide their the head
let's do a size comparison of the wacom one
that's something that we do not have on the
it's kind of an all-in-one cable and let me show this to you
it's very very easy to connect this tablet to your computer now
you're probably wondering how it performs it performs like a
I'm very impressed with the performance of this tablet again
it's not very big but it is a great tablet to have like
I mean even though this unit is made of plastic
it really doesn't get any better than this you know
I've yet to find another brand that performs quite like like a Wacom
does you know there's zero jitter that even when you're zipping right along
let's pick a little watercolor here and see what we can do
we're gonna do some drawing with pinky boo
and she's gonna do some drawing here in clip studio
yeah there's so we got real pencil here that's it
so does it feel like like you're drawing for real
I like about the walk comes is you can push a little bit harder
you can make the pencil blood bigger if you want it
yeah see if you push harder you can necessarily draw on for real and
that hasn't mean that it feels like actual pencil right
yeah well you didn't actually use the pencils whole white color pencil
I don't know what pose I'm trying to do here
Photoshop actually works really good in this too
I think it's a really good tablet for the price
I didn't realize this unit didn't have an eraser I want to erase
it's made of metal but that doesn't mean that the one is cheap
I purchased in the past again for $399
I mean you're getting a really good tablet
it is walking so you know you're gonna get the performance that you want
I said it hooks up fantastically in my laptop
I think it's a great entry point now
great little unit actually exceeded my expectations again
Wacom if you're looking for more art and animation videos subscribe to clownfish animation
and if you want to join our community go to clownfish talk com
it's got some good improvements over the previous version
Amazon's Fire HD 8 is a small tablet
lets you do a lot of things like read ebooks
you can download other apps as you wish the button
placements are all along the top of the device
there are some changes and improvements over the previous versions
life has also increased from about 8 hours to about 12 hours
atmos speaker which we'll talk about in a little bit
so there's a bit of an improvement there now
the camera has had some tweaks made to it though
the audio quality on the tablet is good
this tablet comes loaded with apps and productivity tools
there's a web browser called silk email maps contacts calendar calculator
so you can download other apps you might want
adapter there's also a microSD slot for external storage
and when it comes to audio you have that three-and-a-half millimeter headphone jack
if you use other power adapters that you may already have lying around
and that's supposed to give you about 12 hours of battery life now
I didn't do the whole drain the battery test
the tablet comes preloaded with audible for audiobooks
but it just shows as offline so again
I hope the Alexa issue is resolved soon
I was really surprised by how much I liked this tablet
you may already have getting the all new
you can read more about it online at tech gadgets
Canada com I've got a full write-up there
I hope everyone out there can watch and enjoy
I'm Erin you can find me on Twitter or Instagram until the next video
I'm reviewing the huion H s 64 so hurry on
please don't contact me if they don't work though
it all worked really smoothly out of the box
it didn't seem to work in my sort of galaxy
they're all the same really to be honest
tablets that have 2000 levels of pressure sensitivity and
it's slightly more tricky to draw on to a smaller surface
one of the cheaper stuff seen at around 30 pound $30
and thanks to huion for sending me the tablet
that you've all been asking me about the lenovo duet chromebook
it's colorful it gets surprisingly bright at 372 nits and it
i still think it performs better than you'd expect from those specs
we've got a little bit of battery magic here
and guess what there's great news for you
it actually looks like a lot of the other reviewers shared my experience
but the one that i ordered actually did not arrive prior to this video
there are speakers they produce some sound and that is all that's same
i actually think the build of this device is pretty cool
i love love that all the accessories are magnetic like the keyboard
i think you'll all agree with me on
i know you only come here for the incredible sense of humor
this is the part where i make an awful joke about this
you know dongle adapter so you can plug headphones into it
but that adapter goes into the usbc port
if you made it this far it means that you like the content
whatever so that i can go home and just smile all week long
however if you can afford that many devices that are frivolous like that
i am very very impressed with this overall
everyone so that's the end of the review
and here's what we've got coming up next
this is the part of the video where i go
what do you want me to talk about
what questions do you have about this device
thank you as always for watching and i'll see you next time
I want to take a look at this
that was sent in to me by my friends at gearbest
thank you very much gearbest as you can see
let's go over a few specifications of it for you
the pipo w2s has an 8 inch screen as 1920 by 1200 pixels display
L the 8 inch screen is 283 PPI and it is an IPS
okay so it's just have a bit of an update today
Windows this thing is pretty fragmented in the way
it doesn't have a hard drive and it is as e
that ok will boot into Windows and where we go okay
then let's find out what we're looking for here
well here we are in the disk map windows
so that's where you can recover the tablet from which
here is the little tablet on gear bests own site and you can see
it's 86 pounds 80 pence at the moment
you can't get it in black it's available while it looks things
I mean you know so many at a time
it's very easy to close windows down like the browser
there's one of the cameras we have a
here are the accessories you get with it
don't really need this charger because you can actually use any standard
from the guys at gearbest it had a fairly outdated
it wasn't the latest of what is the other 1701 or something
the latest one or 17 11 is the latest operating system so
it does make it very very difficult to be honest with you guys
I'll show you how I had to do it
I had to find it via the file server
I don't try this so paint 3d yet
here it comes here we go so you can start a new project
it seems to run alright on here so oops
we've got the file server open as well
seven one gigabytes of free space on a nineteen point seven gigabytes all right
let's take a look at the camera then
I've just taken guys taking off down the bottom here
will you ref programs so you got the choice
I've got my favorite magazine installed on here
let's compare it with a 10 inch my 10 inch as you can see
this was a a bit of a hybrid
you've got one small enough to actually plug in to the little pepo
alright let's plug it in and give it a go there we go
it's just a long press and there it
you can also run this little tablet as a proper PC with a keyboard
I've got this little Bluetooth keyboard connected up here
hopefully we should be off then to gearbest there we are
really soon as they sent us the little tablets
so you can only know this is only a small little bluetooth keyboard
I've got here because of a larger one
they're a little small laptop which should be quite good
this is running quite nicely off of this little
that's more or less the same size as this
and whatever you on it which would be a lot easier to operate
yeah well so there we go okay guys
I hope you enjoyed taking a look at this
it's quite a nice little bit of kid
it'll still work the same for you guys for a future project for this
if you did please feel free to subscribe
just look for the how to support my channel
I've got a couple of guys already helping me there
so thank you very much so to those two guys
remove the box out of the way and here we go this is it
it was working earlier on hence they at the time and everything
okay thanks a lot of stuff so as you can see up here
Meg even not mistaken so could be better bought again
obviously this is where it's aimed so let's just come out of there
it's already got a pre-loaded audio thing for you just to see screens
a few children to watch video of that
that's good as well so again for you as the parent
you've got your browser fully fresh fully fledged browser there
you've got two children you can have it
let's go back if you've got two children thing
it'll take you back if you get it right once obviously
fantastic for you to pick up and play with many trials an avenue
there'd be no problem there but all-in-all $37.99 an excellent
Buy and the specs of it are a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core processor
this is kind of how the box looks so
keep on watching okay so this is in the box
it feels like a nice weight not too heavy not too light
okay so this is the tablet outside of the box
you can find it on amazon for fifty to sixty dollars
i've seen the prices change a few dollars here and there
this is the pen that it comes with on the side of the pen
this will connect the tablet to your comp
and this is the size comparison with the tablet
just connect the cable from the tablet to the computer
this is the app that huion comes with
after i opened the tablet but i was wrong
my computer was very laggy as you can see
it was on five percent so that was probably another reason
i feel way more comfortable and i could do that online
better and faster than i did in this time lapse so yes just practice
i also was having trouble because i haven't used photoshop too much
you can also connect to your phone if you have an android
the cursor is only visible on some devices like on the galaxy note
so if you have that this might be a great option
also keep in mind if you connect it to your phone
you're not going to be able to use the whole tablet workspace to draw
on mouse you can use it on sketchbook ebs pane etc
unique is the fact that it's heavily commercialized
so you can purchase it at basically any electronics store
otherwise lepen tablet PC is a pretty generic device in terms of specs
actually used the same charger is a little bit shady to be honest now
the tablet itself which is very reflective is a huge fingerprint
Brendon lanyard cord and a squirrel like traveling AC adapter
here you can see the serious speakers which are very loud
is it hold switch a volume rocker as long as a micro
SD card slot be hidden behind a cover
you notice that the screen is extremely vibrant
and so this allows you to actually see the tablet
now this is good because in darker environments
you have the browser the calendar the camera Google Maps of course in Gmail
the wifely reception is also pretty strong suits
now for some weird reason even though the device does have a 2 gigabyte
the left hand tablet does a pretty nice job
it's just a smartphone operating system being stretched onto a larger screen
and you'll see that on a lot of different applications
just click on that and see how fast it loads now over
Wi-Fi it is pretty speedy as far as the reception goes
see here that multi-touch is also a pretty smooth experience overall
well most likely it's also going to be available here
a fro device was released so unfortunately it remains sukkah
that's out of an Apple iPad or HP TouchPad
if you're gonna be again browsing the web or viewing content
we also liked how the controls on the side of the device
Lipan tablet and we found that for the most part
we haven't really seen in any other tablet
PC running Android OS because unlike sits unlike the resolution of sixteen by nine
impressive and the device is actually quite hefty
some beta but this device has a lot going for it
so that's the major things there this is a generic
you're not gonna get any skinned experiences like the Amazon fire devices
Samsung devices this one is going to be completely bare
you see you have an apps button to show you
what kind of apps are running right now
the Sam's Club app is basically a subsidiary of Walmart
it's the same company it's kind of like the Costco of Walmart
sometimes there's a little sticker on it and it'll give you a digital code
you go online and there you go you have a digital copy via the
once you do you get four different highlights
you can make notes by typing on the keyboard
you can also bookmark at the top little page curls over to show
yeah so you can buy books on this device
this is more or less the type of interface that
so they have basically a mobile version tapping into their website
we don't have four speakers or even two
there's just the single on the back but the volume capacity is quite good
and you didn't get that kind of crackling
yeah it's actually not too bad very surprising
this is a digital comic on the comiXology app
this really gives you a sense on the vibrancy of the screen
so it's pretty respectable you know for the value
Gray's when you look at a black spot yeah so this is guided view
it sort of just isolates the specific frames
well you're not gonna really kind of get like a full
Discordian to experience with this so I rated a bye
dude everybody's using the iPad pro nail artist is I would god Rafi stop
let's find out by the end of this
I want to draw something that I might use in a comic book page
I don't want this piece to be just okay
I want it to be good enough to show in my portfolio
I like the fiddle so I really like that
I could jump in and get really granular with the design
I need to find a really cheap tablet
I found this one it's a little hooey on
I going to do a full review of this tablet
what are we gonna find in the box
I have ever seen I am just gonna gently
I might want to get a pillow now
we're gonna have to go online and find the drivers also pen
I I think we're ready to go here first thing
it's a little bit bigger than a credit card
I'd say about a third bigger than a credit card
so that gives you the idea of how small of an area
I draw a line if I draw a tiny little line on this tablet
the other thing that happens on a smaller tablet like this is
they did especially the lines on that character
I wouldn't let 2,000 levels of pressure sensitivity dissuade you
I needed to do now once I got to the colouring phase
I found it to be a lot easier now
I just don't have to be as accurate
I don't exactly want it to look like a silhouette perfectly
I'm used to drawing on the larger screen again
I wouldn't know that this wasn't done on an iPad or larger Cintiq tablet
I hope that helps to know a lot of you
I wanted to thank you guys for watching to the end
I really appreciate it and I'll see you in a couple of days
Galman and I got into contact with each other about me
plus getting my hands on a really nice
we got the adjustable stand a protection bag
I actually misplaced when I moved into my apartment
eight replacement pen nibs which are stored in the pen holder
just just just rub them out just rub them out
what are you doing what are you doing
just take a credit card and rub them out
all you have to do is just rub them out
you just have to go ahead and do it
you might say that but nope you're wrong
I'm confident that I can scratch at it as hard as I can
the button programming interface is also convenient to use
it's sturdy and holds the tablet firmly in place under pressure
the pen itself feels really satisfying against the screen protector
so how does the tablet perform during actual use
you may be asking well from my personal experience
this tablet is super overpowered for anything that I do with it overall
I'd give this tablet a solid thumbs up recommendation
so it's quite a pricey tablet coming in at
I believe the price is a hundred and thirty pounds
I've got to say straight off the bat
it is a nice piece of kit this
it is the best tablet that I've ever used
it's just a tactile enough to sort of
oh it boasts all the pressure sensitivity 8,000 levels response rate and so forth
it was kind of instant on my screen
the drivers work very well in the driver
they sometimes don't have the ability to change that you can program your buttons
they don't seem to be able to do that the ones I've seen anyway
it was it was a remarkable piece of kit
obviously there's there's issues with that being 160 pounds
Pro which is lovely but in terms of the Wacom tablets
I haven't used a modern one so I can't properly compare but I don't
I haven't heard that they've done anything new in special words
this surface does seem to be that much nicer it was very very fluid
it's got tilt support as well so it this
this has everything that you'd want from your graphics
it's got your adaptors for your mobile phone in fact
and it's not those sort of things you want to worry about
it's the actual feel and is it comfortable
this like this for your left hand is and so forth
I can't test is longevity because I will
that would help other people and that'd be perfect
so yes this is the best graphics tablet
hello you lovely lot and welcome to a new video today
I'm gonna be doing a review of the Kenton
this is just gonna be my full and honest opinion of the product
Katy 16 is a screen tablet with an active screen area measuring 15.6 inches
Full HD resolution and a color gamut of 92% ntsc
currently this tablet retails on amazon UK at 235 pounds
it came in a sturdy cardboard box which
you do get different kinds of nibs with these
I'm wearing compression gloves because my hands have circulation issues
there isn't any assembly required with this tablet because the stand came already attached
the tablet was easy enough to set up though
so yeah that was definitely a plus for this tablet
I presumed that you weren't supposed to take it off
and it had a subtle grip and the pen didn't slide around so generally
it felt a lot like working on paper
this tablet said that they were impressed with the lack of parallax
it's basically the distance of the cursor from the pen tip itself so
in the middle of the shortcut-keys it was easily accessible
and it was very comfortable to use and it turned with a nice solid
you know unless you want to the slotting
the side of the tablet is also handy for storing the pen
I used my simplest cell shading style which utilizes fairly sharp
I was pleasantly surprised with the Katy sixteen
performance was generally consistent and it felt great to use
so they're both very good boys but one is significantly smarter than the other
hi everyone and welcome back in today's video
the logo is on the underside of the glove
so that's good and the drawing glove is really useful
then we have the pen and the pen
here's a quick size comparison with a white gel pen that I have
the pen also requires no charging and no batteries
unlike other stylus pens that you need to plug in to charge
these sorts of tablet screens do require a fair amount of different cables
video is default so default settings default brushes
fancy as you can see the pressure sensitivity was really great
I found the 15.6 inch screen size to be perfect for me
XP pen makes a variety of different screen sizes and price points
I have here is a really nice size for me
also this particular model doesn't come of a stand
it's an extra but they do have one if the necessary for you
I didn't find it a problem to work flat when I'm drawing normally
it's also quite easy to have a little mobility now that said
it plugged into the laptop and into the power source
this is great for me because I have quite small hands and my hands
my hand can get strained and tired from holding the larger sized pens and
I also really liked the no charging required function of this pen
I didn't see anything that was noticeable to me
I found in the past that when working in Photoshop
I had with a tablet when I was working
I did have one when I set out the tablet
so if you're having any issues then getting the latest driver may solve them
resetting the settings to default tends to fix anything
that's acting odd at least in my experience
the pen is great to use the pressure
Hill artwork and my thoughts on this tablet
I hope you enjoyed the review and found it
helpful thanks again to XP pen for letting me try the tablet out
i'm doing a review for this kids edition
android tablet the s7 the matrix pad and it's from um thank you
it looks like they have a pre-installed kid ass apps on it
so this tablet is a seven inch ips screen technology
you have the um the usb port the memory slot the headphone jack
oh it's not the case it's the core
it's a usb core charger and just go back into the tablet to charge
we have the camera youtube setting chrome file photos
google play that's the pre-installed apps we're going to show you later
here's um voice call and here you have photos drive movie maps and gmail
everything arrived nicely packaged and the first thing I found was this drawing glow
I open the main box I found this little
and the tablet itself safe and sound and this clear packaging below that
I'm gonna be testing this tablet on my Mac laptop with Photoshop CC
the tablet is right around $120 and the design is really nice
it's made of quality materials and has these smooth rounded edges
the pin pressure felt perfect for me and my light-handed touch
the tablet is 11 inches by 6 point 8 7 inches and
there are eight customizable shortcut keys and I was able to easily program
I think this is a really awesome tablet
I think it's a solid option for beginners intermediate artists or even advanced artists
picker speeds up my workflow however with the current driver
I'll have those links down below in the description
I want to talk about the XP pengie 430 gaming tablet
you don't have to charge it or replace batteries
it also comes with ten spare pen tips
a pen tip remover and a quick guide here are some specs
the active area is 120 by 77 millimeters
there are two color selections black and white
the driver has many options such as change the active area
you want to use the tablet on and disabled buttons on the pen
though there was one problem which was you cannot disable the pen tip
the back of the tablet has four rubber stops which prevents it from slipping
it is just around the thickness of the mechanical pencil
the cursor never froze so thankfully that problem was solved
yeah you don't have to worry about that now
USB connection so if you by any way damage the cable oh well
if it doesn't work anymore you have to get a new tablet and now
Gulman a 56k or something like that but I really recommend this tablet
if you're thinking of getting a budget tablet anyway guys
no see haven't seen you since last year anyway today
it is huge when I first opened the box
there's the little card from gam on quit
Start Guide it's a Quick Start Guide ok when I first opened it
the stand and everything can't fit in it
it's just like to protect the drawing tablet
whenever you go in this box there are chords
hurry up this is the pen stand and nin remover
and it comes with the screwdriver to screw on the stand onto your tablet
I don't need to look at the screw
quit it and in this tiny box if I could get it open
gosh finally the pen finally underneath all of that is the actual tablet itself
wow it has ten shortcut keys and five menu keys anyway
there's this matte screen projector on it and you can take it off
it has all the instructions on how to like screw stand on the back
you're so handy with tools aren't you anyway
these are all the cores that you need and the two on the right
go into the tablet and the three on the left
and then lastly this is the pen charger
USB port whatever here I just show you how to take the nibs out
it's pretty easy and it fell through great
there are eight replacement nibs if yours ever get worn down
I didn't show it when I unboxed it
so you just choose whatever one applies to you
the pen has over 8,000 levels of pen pressure which is very nice
paint this speed paint is like the first time
I've ever drawn on this and I use this all the time
you have to develop like hand-eye coordination which
oh if you're left-handed on the menu you can just flip everything 180 degrees
I haven't talked to you guys in a while
it'll be out hopefully this month or early next month
I don't really care I made it for you guys
I'm still putting some new stuff on there but for now
I'm gonna plug it into my next video
but so thank you very much for being very patient with me
I am stressed but I hope you like this video
I'm sorry and thank you so much for watching
the alcatel one t10 appears to be an excellent option
october i have been testing it for past few days
so this smart tablet by alcatel has a simple and ergonomic design
the black panel had a slightly textured surface
mm audio jack usb type c port and the sd card slot yes
this is a wi-fi only device and through the slot
we can expand the memory up to 128 gigs moving
screen hd tab with 1280 by 800 resolution at 151 ppi
i realize it's not the brightest screen in the bunch
octa-core mt-8167 chipset with two gigs of ram and 32 gigs of internal storage
this tablet is not built for heavy games
this hybrid tablet is powered by 4080mah battery
it has two speaker grilles which provide a loud and strong sound
the other person was not feeling any difference in calls as well
thanks to alcatel for providing a keyboard along with this
i say having a laptop and a tablet at this price is rare
the current price will be updated in the description
we have come to the end of this video
Ranjit and I have been using the Samsung Galaxy
it supports a very high resolution screen and sports a Super AMOLED screen
it works pretty well the UI is the Samsung magazine
hundred pixels the tablet has three gigs of ram hence
I did not even have four problems loading very heavy websites on this tab
s moving to the other browser for example
the blacks are inky blacks and the contrast level is also excellent
we also have the fingerprint scanner which is embedded within the home button
so if you have a Samsung based Android smartphone with the Wi-Fi direct
so even folding in a single hand is a decent experience
so what do I think about this Samsung Galaxy
I hope that you found this video review helpful if you found it helpful
I'll appreciate if you can click the like button

I have a drawing tablet review for you
so we have an artist glue that's included and this is the tablet
it's a 10 by 6 inch drawing tablet
that tells you where you can download the driver the USB cable
you have the pen and the pen case
let's take a look at the tablet itself now in an earlier video
we have this wheel and in the middle
there is a button design of the tablet
let's connect this to my computer and test it out
I'm using Windows now and I've just installed a Windows driver
so let's see what we can do with the driver
this is where you can customize the twelve physical shortcut buttons
I have already set the usual shortcuts that are used
let's see what you can assign to each physical shortcut button
Windows ink let me turn on Windows ink and try it again alright
I see some jitter pressure jitter all right now
I'm not going to draw anything complicated for this review
sixty dollars and a 15 non-pro it's us 56 dollars
I don't have any major issues except for the usual Photoshop
they seem to come out just the way
the shock cut so now redo it's working fine this buttons
they have very nice firm feedback this is MIDI bang paint Pro okay
this is way more responsive compared to Photoshop and pressure sensitivity works really
which is great has tried a transition from thin to thick
so let me just zoom down a bit and try again all right now
Krita now notice the shape of the cursor
quita is also of very responsive app by the way this drawing tablet
um it's one of those where there is no screen on the tablet
so you have to actually look at your display and draw nowadays when
let me just draw my daughter who is now almost two years
this review will not be complete without me showing you how it performs on
Mac OS so this is clip studio paint now
I discovered a few issues with Mac OS driver
so the first issue is the function switch
size windows driver works fine just that with Mac OS driver
alright to conclude if you are a Windows user
they work really well so no issues with
i wouldn't recommend this tablet to make OS uses for the issues
you can find them through the links in the video description below
if you have any questions let me know in the comment section
if not see you guys in the next video bye
The Huion HS64 is a mini drawing tablet
like you would expect, but you can also use on
Your device’s settings, system settings, or about page shows your version.
In this case the tablet works without having to do anything else.
Also, you can’t rotate your phone or tablet to draw in landscape mode.
Pressure sensitivity does work. The HS64 also works with computers.
First, uninstall any other tablet drivers. If you uninstall something, restart your computer.
Download the driver for Windows or Mac, depending on what you use.
In the second tab, set the pen’s shortcut buttons.
Game Mode is good for playing games like OSU.
Well, I’m amazed something so small works so well.
Unlike drawing tablets that have screens, with a screenless tablet
you can have a size this tiny and still feel comfortable.
I don’t have a stylus for my phone, so I couldn’t compare that.
my phone didn’t fall off the slippery book tower.
As for phone battery drain, it’ll vary depending on your phone and drawing app.
For me, using the tablet in Flipaclip cost 8% of battery charge per hour.
On the computer side, I have no criticisms.
now the only other tablet that may be announced soon is the tab
Samsung just released their newest mid tier model the Tab
it's a very minor difference being a little over
I couldn't hold it with one hand now
it doesn't feel like that seamless piece of glass
that would go all the way to the edge
starting with the right offers very clicky and good feedback
now going on to the very bottom is a micro
USB charging port with a 3 and 1/2 millimeter headphone input
it's not bad at all in hearing actor voices and sound effects
it is to be expected though on nearly every tablet then last year
there's nothing on the left side and nothing on the top
fine i got'em it because of its low
just really doesn't cut it from moderate users
if you have a few tabs in a web-browser
I believe but now let's take a look at the interface here
real quick smooth transitions swiping all the way to the left now features
Flipboard where you can see all of your news
the 1.5 gigs is very much 2013 maybe 2014 here spec requirements there and
I'm shocked as far as we're into technology today
you starting to show and being fair it works
it's good for a light to generic use here
2 gigs of RAM 77 percent increase in pixel density for sharper images and
it's the same price basically as the Tab
comm you guys take care and I'll see you in the next one bye
so i enjoy the occasional game of elite dangerous and by occasional
touch have been in touch and asked me to review one of their tablets
this is the 10 inch dragon touch android tablet
i'm not the only one with this keyboard shortcut problem if you look online
glass this is a free to download app for your phone and tablet you
you don't have to look something up and then look at your keyboard
you simply put and prod your tablet or mobile phone
but round the side you've got the volume rockers
and check out the interface as quite often
these low-cost tablets can suffer from slightly sluggish interface
it's actually quite smooth as you're scrolling through and the playback is also fine
google docs and found this worked very well
on the tablet you can easily search for images type via the on-screen keyboard
the tablet was on a really cool stand
we're going to be checking out the five best budget tablets right now
be sure to check the links in the description below okay
the fifth product on our list is the amazon fire hd8
then the amazon fire hd 8 is a great budget option for you
the deeper blacks found on more expensive tabs overall
the performance is quite impressive for a sub 100 tablet
it does feature their amazon kids mode for child safe content
the key features are display the 8 inch
you'll get about 12 hours of mix use dual 2 megapixel cameras
sound for watching movies and listening to music
the fourth product on our list is the lenovo tab m10 plus
this is our best budget tablet for families
bezels giving you a higher screen to display ratio overall
atmos is ideal for families to watch videos movies
you also get a kids mode which gives you a little more
parental controls than what the fire hd offers
protection helps to reduce the risk of eye strain
which is something you don't normally find at this price range battery
the third product on our list is the samsung galaxy
tab a this is our best value budget tablet
but what's also great about the ipad is that it's not only for entertainment
you can even connect a mouse or trackpad making your work
except there isn't anywhere to properly store your pencil when you're not using it
you'll love the incredible detail and vivid colors all day battery
you can expect up to 10 hours of mixed use a12 bionic chip
there's really nothing it can't do if you're on a tighter budget
the ipad delivers exceptional value and unmatched performance in an entry-level tablet
lite may be a great option for you
really gives it a premium look and feel without the premium price
aren't bad giving you a more cinematic audio experience
a 10.1 with up to one terabyte of storage s pen included
hope to see you guys in the next video till next time
so let's get unboxing so here in the Box
it's a very nice soft bag to hold the tablet in
the active area on this tablet is 9 by 6 inches
it is very nice and it's very thin and light
it is not heavy at all next in the Box
this makes it easier for your hand to uh glide across the tablet
so as you review what you get in
I usually have a lot of problems when installing tablets on my computer
it has 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity and
I think this one has 8 Express keys which is really cool
with how easy the wireless was to set up
I was expecting it to be really complicated overall
the pen does not require any battery or charging so
I did find this to be interesting so at first
it has a six hundred hour battery life so
I don't think you'll have to worry about it
so the price of the huion tablet is $100
so this tablet is about half the price of other competing tablets overall
I would overall give the Helion tablet a 5 out of 5 stars
I think it worked very well and I really enjoyed my experience with it
so this ends my review of huion dw8 69
Kabir solutions with a review of the HP Proust slate 12 Android tablet
you've got a 1600 by 1200 resolution which is ok
connector at the bottom this particular model has nano
you've got the power and on off at the front
you've got a 2 megapixel camera at the back
we've got a trial version of coal painter
the full app costs three pound 89 from the
which gives you two options so from here
which is where you can write on a paper notepad and it copies whatever
what you're actually writing on the piece of paper which
let's just change that for a little bit
so just there's a standard kind of as you can see very good handwriting
this is the view of HP Pro 12
so it's on the pen mode and then from there
we align the tablet and it's a bit tricky
I'm writing from the paper to the screen
maybe if it's a general use tablet that you after it's okay
then it's pretty good so thanks for watching
it's as sleek as a tablet can get these days
oh and it's waterproof the Xperia z4 tablet is gorgeous
it's got a clean and flat look and it takes portability seriously
but you still have front-facing stereo speakers flanking and on either side
jack don't have any flaps protecting them but they are safely waterproof now
that's one thing that we were more than happy to test for the camera
Sony's Xperia UI has graduated to Android lollipop and the UI
aesthetic is quite close to what you have on stock
the neverending live wallpaper and the side context menus you also get
there is no split screen mode for running two apps side-by-side
z4 tablet is very fast our benchmarks show great
LTE version standby is impressive to the eight point
come out nice and sharp with spot-on colors
full-size light it's impossibly thin and light and it's also a pleasure to use
well this one hardly has a match out there
hey everybody a flaw inside but in the folks in
Lenovo let us borrow their tab to a ten tablet to check out today
but that's mainly because they put so much into the display
you like fruit ninja or something like that will be fine
here the standby button is there and that's pretty much it for ports
adapter here at the top on the back
you've got an 8 megapixel camera so you can take some pictures you know
they're very decent as far as its frame rates concerns
it's really going to lag quite a bit
pretty well on here and I like to run the 3dmark benchmark
the nice 10 inch display very high resolution
who's just looking to read some stuff do some email
it's me Hawaiian Oh huion you look so different
Hugh Leon it's like they knew I was betraying them
I can't really redesign S&T however I can redesign super SMT
I'm already seeing some pros and cons pros
it comes with two drawing gloves just in case you lose one
which is not very good for your posture
just something to consider if you want to buy this tablet all that aside
why don't we start test seeing this out by drawing something
I even drawn a super form for S&T since 2009
I do a redesign for it for a reference
this is what our super form looked like back then
I even made a fancy pantsy transformation video for it
I'm not sure why but I made it like flowy and angelic
it seems kind of silly now but I'm gonna leave this in the corner
user named in spaghetti sent me a redesign that they did very quickly
I really wanted S&T to have that super look in her hair
Sonic and shadows quills look so I did my best to capture that shape
I not only made her hair bigger but also point Z er
I pointed her ponytail and bangs upward to further
regular outfit but upgraded like if she had an evolution like a Pokemon
I changed the gloves into these sort of half gloves
I was half inspired by my drawing gloves
I gave her skirt a belt because I felt like
I took the S&T reference and color shifted it until her hair
like she was in a super form and when
I did that her clothes turned blue and I really liked how that looked
I actually did a lot more to this
I really love how this design turned out
it felt a lot more accurate than the
I don't want to let it go to waste my Christmas
hey everyone sage here back again with another video and yes another tablet review
i'm proud to say that this video is brought to you by galman again
this tablet is pretty small and perfect for beginners
the warranty card can be found right behind the thank you card
and the next one is the tablet itself
so that whenever you're working the tablet won't slip off
i'm actually shocked that there is an artist's glove for this and the manual
i'm not really used to drawing with my phone
according to the tablet model downloaded it and installed it in my computer
i was here and now you're telling me that it was not enough
even if i'm not around you can wake me up
come around will go through and forcing you to say i'm here for you
you know even if i'm not around you can wake me up
i will drive my kids to make you feel alright
i know what you deserve when no one showed you
love will someday come around with foreign so okay
i am actually amazed at the performance of this product
you can get this tablet with a 28 off discount again
thank you so much for watching and i'll see you guys soon
bye the cable where you're supposed to con
where you're supposed to connect your tablet to your computer or your android iphone
i actually said iphone one at first i tested out the pho
why did i say phone instead of a tablet
i mean the pen is pretty responsive sage
hi everyone this is teal from pocket box comm today
g10 tee this is actually a wireless tablet for use with your computer
we all sent this to me a few weeks ago
I've been trying this off for a few weeks today
I have already taken out the tablet rice
do you want to show it to you
so they have this cushion to protect the tablet
these are the boxes that hold accessories inside this box
and this is the box with the pen case and the pen
so let me put this away to show you the actual tablet
I first took it out of the box
at the back we have one solid piece of metal and the front
the corners are rounded all the look and feel of
this is the power switch to use it
you will need to switch this on if you are charging it
the tactile feel of all these buttons are quite good
the feeling of the trackpad is good as well
but for some reason they appeared suddenly and some blemishes here as well
so this tablet you can attract some blemishes and
I'm not sure you can see the fingerprints
they do not work as well as I expect them to be
I'll talk more about that later on now
the working area of this tablet is 10 inches by 6 inches
and there is very little basil around the edges the top and the bottom
let's look at the pen case the pen and other accessories
this is a nice looking case or well-built very sturdy
it's rather long and it has a tapered end here
it's battery-powered so you do need to charge it
this is the charging cable for the pen
I don't think that's going to be a problem
if it runs all battery just charge it
I'm now using the tablet in Wireless mode
this is where we can change their shortcut buttons
you can map the whole tablet to the whole screen
the tablet is using a 16 by 9 aspect ratio
so this area services for white aspect screens which most monitors are nowadays anyway
and here in this part you can actually rotate the tablet
I'm not going to show you how the tablet performs with various drawing apps
Sol and newer if you are using older Mac OS then
they are all in the text review that is on my blog
just visit the link in the video description below all right this is
the straighter looks let me switch over to using
meant for tablets but it's also available on the Mac desktop
there are no what you turn in fact
I think this performs even better compared to Photoshop
Pro so it works very well with MIDI Bank King
that's designed for the tablet so it supports all those features
I have created a new flower in MIDI Bank
I'm rotating right now using the trackpad clockwise and it does not work
it doesn't seem to recognize what I'm trying to do
it seems that our just does not work
I'm now going to switch over to using Crete R
I'm not sure if it's supposed to behave like this
the pressure works anyway so it somehow works in
let me open my tax review to see if
that wasn't this problem but now there is this problem
to the text review so illustrator cs5 works fine is chief sketches procreate
nothing comes out now with illustrator cs5 and CC
I think illustrator cs5 it works fine but with illustrator
it will always drag my buttons around when in fact
I just want to click the button to open that pad
we've just have them because there are a lot of issues
I have to test to see if I can replicate them
and today you see in some of my demonstration
thanks for watching see you in the video I you
i don't understand why they've mixed the colors
there and type c port for charging along the bottom here
we have a sim tray and a headphone socket
i actually asked myself when i got this
june was the latest security update so in terms of that
my son played some games on it as well battery life
i haven't actually tried it as a phone
i don't know how that would actually work
we have speakers here at the bottom and they do go really loud
lay it flat and have it full blast or near a full blast
then it's more manageable on the ear my ears anyway obviously
five megapixel on the rear and two megapixel on the front
don't buy this tablet for a camera because it's it's not good
eight cores four gigs of ram plenty of storage as well
it is a very very good tablet and something
i just think it is a great tablet for how much you're paying
so if you're looking for a tablet and you've got 100 quid
see you in the next one bye you
Hello everyone, welcome back to the Keep Productive YouTube channel on today's feature
I wanted to review a combination of things today
All you need to know but I will be doing a longer review.
So let's first start by talking about the design now first off.
It is very thin as you can see
you have this like rubber that helps for example?
It's it gets a little bit scuffed and I've been fairly careful with it
keeping it in a portfolio that they offer with it
Maybe that's cuz I got the white edition.
There were three buttons at the bottom in the middle
What's really nice is when you're using it.
I don't know whether you can hear that
And naturally that's when the Battery depletes faster
This is the pen that comes along with it.
Although this one isn't there's two types of pen. There's like a Classic one.
and it's also this signature one now they both
It does allow you to write pretty well on it.
They have these nib things on top and you can change them
I don't think they get worn down as fast.
I've probably only changed my once in two months
You can do one of two things you can either Connect it.
And it's helpful for annotating but nothing major
It's again something that you'll find that you may use
The good thing is one thing I was impressed with
I believe it's a thin thick and Thick thin medium and thick
and also when you're using the highlighter, you can change the shade you
You can also do handwritten text and then convert it into text
But I would say you have to be a very good writer
Now the one feature I've liked is the send by email feature
Being able to send it in a PNG or PDF, which is very helpful
where you can edit the layers, for example
So I created this sort of new structure
so can actually sort of plan out stuff a bit more strategically
So on the settings side of stuff you can do a range of things.
I wouldn't think I look at but at the same time
7 to 8 out of 10 and the main reason is
So for me, this is like a really nice experience
But it doesn't necessarily replace a journaling or anything like that.
they're the things that sort of the cons
Then that might ruin the natural offline aspects of it
I think it's designed for more of a premium market
I know that from seeing some of the videos they do and all that
It's to help you get away from that environment
This tablet is designed to get you away from that environment
Flowing it doesn't necessarily I notice like even backers noting.
how good is it in terms of the sketching abilities?
And again, I would probably give this about a 7 out of 10
I would say the iPad with the Apple pen from using it
There are now two two editions as of this video
But you can get refurbished models on the site for like fifty dollars less
now, let's talk about the markers that you get with that
separately, which means you then add up to 550
But I believe there sometimes you starter packets which include it for free
But if you wanted a signature on its own, I believe that's 99 bucks.
It's a really nice build quality and I really like the click
Which is either a leather design or this sort of canvas II design
so you can definitely see why this is more of a premium Experience.
But my opinion is I really like this device.
I'm continuing to use it as you can imagine
You know because I've actually found a huge amount of value from
It's also giving me a paper like experience
I think and it's allowed me a bit more creative freedom
You're probably just saying pick up some paper
Francesca because it would be a lot cheaper
I'm gonna look at the rocket book and put it against this
I'm also gonna look to get the remarkable 2 tablet
are there updates in that one looked a lot more attractive with the design?
I will be doing more videos about this
I was contacted by Hume and they asked me if I wanted to do
we do here at circle people for quite a while now
I thought this would be an amazing opportunity to start before we get started
I also want to say that this is not a paid review
i poise or any other in the circle
people stuff it does not get any monetary gain from doing this review
the tablet comes in nice with simplistic box
now let's get into a technical side of things
this does make quite a big difference for me
i as a former mouse player instantly felt more comfortable
the higher the polling rate the less delay there will be from you
the reading height of the tablet is around 1.5 centimeters
I feel that it makes my a more stable
I guess the pen uses two one AAA battery
you can choose if you want that a little heavier or a little lighter
two of them are on the side of the pen
where you grip and you can change to do whatever you want
I'll talk more about that in the driver
part of the video and the other button is on top of the pen
and it's the power button and it's in the shape of an eraser which
all of these buttons have a really satisfying click to them
I'll just play it up here one thing
it doesn't take up a lot of space on your desk
I really do love how it looks like
I found a bit irritating as a dragon player
I noticed the first time might use the tablet
now let's take a look at the drivers for this tablet
unfortunately it's not much to hang in a Christmas tree
it does to work but not efficiently or in any good manner
there is no good way to do this unfortunately hopefully
Shion will release an update this somewhere in the future
I think this tablet can be the right choice
so my friends from gaomon sent over another tablet for us to try now
alright i guess it's time for a new intro
wonderflunky he streams by the way follow him on twitch
alright so i got my footage time to animate over it
it's pretty hot like look look at this
the pen also doesn't need to be charged so no batteries
no extra wires and a super light pen
there are also eight touch keys on the side of the monitor
he's a panda and panda is eat bamboo bambootie so yeah
guess it'll just take a little getting used to
i'm actually planning to give away the tablet
anyway that's the end of the tablet review
here's the finished product and our new intro
my favorite tablets are 8-inch tablets and I reviewed pretty much
every 8-inch tablet that was released in the last couple of years
I was in 15 minutes for this test
it is very well a bit but it does look a bit
Android tablet right now that I can really comfortably recommend the next best one
and it does have many premium features for instance
does everything up in scanner which sits underneath the screen
Android 8 yes is that it's a bit older
I don't forget any major updates anymore and the media
I'm only putting this on this list to make this list complete
inch IPS HD screen Full HD screen and an external 7904 processor
I can super comfortably recommend I really love it is the Samsung Galaxy Tab
I can't promise anything of course because I am NOT Samsung
sadly chances are pretty high that you won't be able to get it easily
at m5 light 8 is a great alternative to both these
I mentioned if those are not available in your country
it's a nice mid-range tablet the next standard on this list is the
it's a lower end to mid-range tablet but it's a pretty nice
it heavily performed very well with 20 3.5 hours
it is noticeably weaker than the S Pen version or than the 8.4
the battery life was pretty good with 13.5 hours in my standard test
it is running and what 9 including one
Amazon doesn't say what it is it is OK
you can't open two apps side by side
I mentioned here because of that but it is worth it
it's a bit of work and I wouldn't recommend your grandmother doing it alone
if this has been the best 8 inch tablets you can buy right now
comm thanks for watching and see you next time
so look who got a package in the mail today
has like a cute little design on it and so right on the back
I don't really understand like the pen writing angle of 60 degrees
I don't know how that helps but it sounds good to me
open ooh almost there not very experienced with bosses
I have ever see if I can get it out
yeah that's got like this nice cloth bag
it's got the keys on the side so
I'm pretty sure the idea is like to replace your nib
you couldn't stick it here and then pull out
so far let's see what else is in the package
there's the wire which obviously every tablet needs unless it's wireless
I love a little package for this just like I love this little tight
oh and it's got a pretty design on it too
let's see if this even fits my hand though looks pretty big
it's a little big but um it doesn't really matter to me because
that's like a neat little package to keep it nice and protected
I can get it off so yeah I like this pen
I'll be reviewing part was a 6/10 plus drawing tablet
I found that the tablet was honestly really amazing
how could the pressure was which is really saying something
I also really loved how the surface of the tablet felt
it's super satisfying to just rub my hands against it a little weird
is that damn good so while it does take some getting used to
I also wanted to talk about the size of the tablet
the size is pretty damn good for $70
it's honestly really cool to actually feel like
I have a lot more breathing room when compared to my last tablets
all these hotkeys being 100% customizable to your liking
I can also really appreciate and finally the price is amazing
it's only $70 and it's a really really really good deal
it's a big tablet performs exceptionally and will last a long time
I think I should go over the cons that I discovered
the most annoying thing about the tablet is whenever
I touched the pen to any sort of surface
this isn't an issue for me at all
don't take away from the quality of the product at all in fact
I was struggling to find any cons at all
I think that this tablet is absolutely amazing the pressure sensitivity is stellar
I'm going to say despite all the hate she gets
because we've never really seen anything like this before the vast majority of people
I've seen talk about this and talk about how crap is she
isn't how ridiculous it was that she could even blame
Jay feather at all without even looking at her point of view
in fact the truth is she never really blamed
Jay feather she always blamed herself all right
maybe she did actually make herself believe it was
how would you feel knowing that it was your own advice
that led your brother to his untimely death
you would never be able to escape the guilt but wait
most of the time your mind will do this subconsciously
so she's not entirely at fault here in my opinion
Rhianna Singh your own advice got your brother killed to be horribly traumatic
the idea that it wasn't her that got her own brother killed
she says how the medicine cats all seem to be acting strange
Don Pelt is noted to have been acting weird ever since poem tales death
Todd's feelings but makes it clear to them that she's mainly just hurt
Jay feather of being a murder at the gathering causing a huge fight
she wants an excuse to be angry with others instead for what happened
well it's not good to blame others and go to such lengths
I really hope I've convinced some of you to feel the same
I'd like to talk about the tablet again for a few brief moments
I think that Pablo is an amazing tablet especially at the price
and you can tell about a lot of care was put into it which
I can really appreciate if you guys are interested in purchasing this tablet which
I really got hope you guys enjoy the video
it was a lot of fun to make
how far does this think ahead and will this
carve a new niche for a declining tablet market
I'm Kevin the tech ninja this is the Nokia in one tablet review
Nokia brought a premium build to the n1 tablet starting with the materials
look and it makes it very pleasing to hold
the tablet layout is pretty familiar volume rocker on the right side
there's no traces of any type of rattling or loose parts
I found that the colors are extremely accurate
the text is decently sharp on the panel but not the sharpest
is that if you put any pressure on the display
I was not really familiar with this chip starting off after digging into it
Ram it weighs just 318 grams as well to keep everything juiced up
USBC connector and it's honestly a joy to use the USBC cord is reversible
beefy specs are only half the story with this device
the tablet provides a smooth and consistent experience throughout all the menus and applications
a great example is when playing plants vs. zombies on some devices
there's a lot of action on the screen
it does slow down a little bit well
another example is a game like fruit ninja
where there's a lot of action on the screen pretty much the whole time
this is one of the best performing ones
and it has a custom launcher on top called the launcher
best is just keep riding until it eventually shows up now
there is something to know about this launcher
great for a tablet now beyond this launcher which is very simple
it's still running a pretty much stock version of
when you're playing it on your tablet and also z launcher settings
which lets you tweak to z launcher a bit more
none of these are anything that would change the game of Android
the front-facing camera provides you with the same story
a lot of images come out yellowish and has a lot of grain
it's a big disappointment that this camera isn't that great everything else
the tablet is great in high quality and premium
I don't walk around taking pictures with my tablet
it ran fine now as far as hardware
it ran all the applications without an issue z
launcher you can throw on any third-party launcher that
offer my recommendation of this tablet as always guys my name is
you know to do if you like this video
while you're down there go ahead and leave a comment as always guys
hi everyone mahmoud is here today i will review another graphics tablet
this is a brand new 2021 model xp pen deco mini 7w graphics tablet
it is wireless and a little bit bigger than small size tablets
01 version 2 is about 70 us dollars
dollars and mini 7 non-wireless version is about 50 us dollars on amazon
and here's the mini 7 wireless graphics tablet
it's good and it has a matte surface
there is a usb c port for charging and the on off button
here this is the back side with four rubber feet
here is the usb receiver for the wireless connection
we have a lot of extra nibs and a nip remover here
these are android mod adapters one micro usb and one usbc and manuals
the tablet has a plug and play option
you can find the website link in the description below
it has settings about working area monitors express keys and pen side buttons
i am going to connect this usb receiver and start checking
the tablet surface is smooth and the pen is really comfortable
you can also teach online with your android device
it's time to talk about pros and cons
so you don't need to worry about the cables around you
you can just charge your tablet after your lessons
it is really really good and cons one thing
there is no panholder in the package and usually small size graphics
tablets do not come with pen holders they can make their own pen
i have a friend guys rui fernandez from portugal
he's one of my viewers so he sent me his setup
and i'm gonna show you guys you can also create a pen holder
um something like that if you need okay
don't forget to leave a comment below and let me know
i will answer your questions as early as possible
and how useful is these tablets for children
I go into details about this tablet itself
let me show you what accessory come with it
let me show you the magnetic cover as you can see
great material and then it's very well made and it's very writing
it's for you to pop in your tablet so okay
so this is a wireless detachable keyboard it will on blue to itself
it do have if you charge it it will show you
I always like one it turn it off
this is very similar to any keyboard which is really nice
okay so let me pop it nicely like that
okay and you so like shutters shake it off
yeah so which is quite a nice little cover here right now
I'm gonna take this up and then I'm gonna show you the tablet itself
okay this is a 10 inch multi-touch screen tablets using an Android 8.1
okay so let me quickly turn it on
there's a few this was what you tell him
oh you can see that you can straightaway
you can have your calculator as a shortcut over here and that's to unlock
I have not download it if you look at it
and then this one is all the general apps in there
you know something like that and they have
I have the YouTube this YouTube at 4-4 for my son
you go play store here so for example
okay let me get out of here first
I no need to set this printer out
it was just printed so at the moment
if you've got a wireless printer excellent it just print it it will
so right this is the PowerPoint go alright
so it's really depends where you want to save it
let me get off having closed this for right now
you can watch movie you can listen to radio do all sort of things
close it down for us okay right next
what do we have able to assess the pictures
so this is where your as management so you can go to your
okay when you're done it let's get out and then we have thumb control
you know after you or you can set like maybe
they can start and you know this is what you do to do it
sometimes they're quite sensitive or something they are not just depend on where
so it's very reassuring that they understand that
Tom passed how inappropriate content for certain age
they were sort of filter and stop the kids from assessing it
that password is to change the parent password
you tell your stories you tell you your your lock
it's depend on what what sort of a system you're using it so
it was just safe into your Google account
I mean the normal apps that is in store here
you go radio your Google map to show them
this set it up so you have this instead of like
there's so many adjustment that you can make as your kids grow it's brilliant
well in a new or at least new for me
let's first see what all you get in the package.
the box art is nice and subtle and that game
art doesn't mean that it's asking you to play games on it.
which is very light and kind of looks different to my huion
huion clearly thought to be nostalgic with its appearance this time.
so that you don't need to wipe the screen with the cleaning cloth.
the inclusion of an extendable cable is smart.
the hdmi port is for the display signal
two ports somehow failed to give enough power to the tablet.
and because the size of this tablet is 13 inches
it will not ask for much power draw anyway.
compared to other bigger display tablets out there.
your phone's charges to give sufficient power to the tablet.
and it also has these anti-slip rubber feet on the bottom.
okay now back to the elephant in the room pun might have been intended.
so lighter than your laptop and 11.8 mm thick in comparison
so it's not a light or super slim display tablet for sure.
hd 13 inches with a 120 srgb color gamut.
and because of the size it feels super compact
but that didn't affect anything i had to do with the tablet.
right after i installed the driver software as admin
uh it then also showed me this button to activate it as admin
make sure you select this screen as the active screen in the driver software.
as i tested the tablet with photoshop the experience was surreal.
like the recent huion products i tested and working on
there is an almost very minor parallax on the screen
thin lg has made extremely slim tv panels
so let's see till when companies like huion etc acquired
oh and you can also work on your androids with this tablet
they have posted a list of compatible devices on their website
it's a usb c 3.1 gen1 with dp 1.2 as mentioned earlier.
and i have no idea why have i just repeated it.
now the only thing left for these tablet is to go wi-fi.
now let me come on to the few drawbacks of this tablet.
if you sit upright which is the healthiest way to sit
for long hours you would find some variations in the screen colors.
so a stand would be a must to use this tablet with.
especially if your eyes for colors are extremely peculiar.
i've tried and used in the past now
it's quite heavier than ipad or a surface pro
the benefits of these tablets are its price and the hardware upgrade convenience.
but at 21000 rupees or 250 us dollars or 230 pounds
and for a healthy upright setting posture too.
third party stands available on aliexpress or amazon
in summary the overall feel of working with this tablet is top notch.
MuBot out. That was a long freaking video man.
how long is it. is it longer than the hobbit.
Android 9.0 has two gigabytes of RAM 32 gigs of storage 5 megapixel camera
on the back as well as a camera on the front up there
GPS Wi-Fi only and it comes in the color of black
so let's put this off to the side
USB cable which it was USB C charging but it is micro USB
there's something to keep in mind when you get this
I don't know I never look at these things
that's actually pretty cool that they give that to you as well
here this is where you gonna have a lot of the button
so you'll have a button that allows you to plug in a headphone headphone
that's a not too crazy than subway surfers
I'm gonna turn the volume down but one thing about the speakers
this should work great with that kind of stuff
I did but anyways you saw it played perfectly fine next up
it's obviously gonna be able to do that so being open up
YouTube and go to my favorite youtuber in the whole world
Greg loves to be and let me play one of these videos
good very impressed with the videos with a look
it is only one speaker on the back here
you're not gonna get stereo speakers but like
Plus this does that great as well open up
how about this pearl and I'm doing this stuff in real time
they plays fine loads up fairly fast as well
I mean I'm not a huge camera person with with tablets
and let's go back here and you can check out
it didn't call it that bad at all
do you know pretty much fine with it
I have it down here so I have a recent apps button
I have my open this up my back button and then I also have
it'll bring down my notifications and let me see my notifications
just you can see the performance of this
it's it's for what you're getting you know in a competitive
the fire tablet the this that this actually runs
it's nice you know the performance isn't that bad
life is pretty good and you know it gives you like
you know pretty much anything that you want on it
let me load up a website real quick here so
we're talking about a pen display tablet and a computer all in one
it's a computer and a graphic tablet fused into just one device
i've been using this for the last three weeks or so pretty much daily
so i've tested a number of different painting softwares
and then the rest of the review will be split in two parts
the first one will be looking at the actual computer inside this thing
and then we'll check out the actual tablet capabilities
how good does it feel to draw on this thing
this was a an extra box that was included with a mouse
and a keyboard both wireless so very nice and nice addition nice touch
wow so here we have this stand um to hold this computer tablet
so i'm a big fan of that very similar to actually
it's the same as the wacom cintiqs in that
and it's not meant to move around because it's it's pretty damn heavy
you have a brand new computer pen display tablet technology
and so i'm sure for most of you
this won't mean much but here we can see that
all went away as soon as it was updated
yeah here just looking at the temperatures stays pretty stable
that is quite demanding but it was never that bad
yeah when it comes to the device itself
i think there's one more thing that i should point out and it is
the pixels would have been fine if it was 16 inches but at 22
at least i didn't uh didn't calibrate anything
i don't know but the distance feels negligible and so very little parallax
you can also see on the side of the tablet here
you can set it to whatever you want
keep things at around a million active polygons and you should be pretty happy
the model that i have here has around seven million total
but when you're logged in as a single user the drivers do behave
drivers without having to reboot your entire machine
well what happens if you want a different
maybe like a better tablet something that is 4k in the future
or what if you want to upgrade your computer to something
that's nice the fact that it's a standalone machine
you don't need a big computer box next to it only one cable
should you buy this and really who is this for so initially
my thought was that this was something that would be great for
you know for people that maybe uh are younger and have no computer
that can barely play solitaire in that case
yeah you know that might be a really really nice upgrade
that costs 950 bucks with keyboard and mouse included
hell yeah that's probably what i would do
which is why we come to the conclusion that this device here
the canvas studio 22 is all about convenience
studio 22 is for you so final words on this device here
well i had a really hard time finding something
is that big of a deal and the drawing part
it's a small tablet with a drawing area of 6 by 4 inches
and it's about the size of my hand so it's a pretty small
these are sleep your cases for the pen
this is a pretty tight fit for the pen
it has a matte texture feeling but overall it's considered quite smooth
the big logo is behind and the design
so you have to download the driver from their website
YJ driver so let's take a look at the features
switch here you can test the pressure sensitivity
there's no way for you to enter your own keys
open a web page or sign the button to a mouse click
this tablet is considered small for this monitor generally speaking
I recommend a graphic tablet that is Liz 10 by 6 inches
you're going to get a very long line
it's really very sensitive and there is no lag
you're gonna have to rely on your keyboard for most of the keyboard shortcuts
you can draw very lightly to get those really thin lines
I did not notice any issues with this
this is clip studio paint and as you can see pressure sensitivity
I have with this tablet is with MIDI Bank paint
I'm gonna be reviewing a 8.5 inch LCD writing tablet
I'm saving it is by taking a photo
it is actually really easy to write with this device
it is just like you're writing on a tablet or also on paper
but it's actually really good if you think about it
it comes with digital painting photo editing or comics and manga so
we have the box which is in this lovely
I should think let's see what else we got
so we've got kind of two buttons and we have got
there can be multiple keystrokes any command on your computer
so this is our introduction thing it tells you what you've got
now plug it in it says go to
so let's go and plug this in and see how it works now
I've just plugged in the interest and this into our setup
it's letting you know you press the button on the pen
I've registered the welcome into a small BT pen pistachio view the software library
I have to press quite hard to get to the end
and that's sort of somewhere in the middle of course the tip double-click distance
I can't feel any difference in that at all
these are the little keys on the pan so the background
if you click is a right click and at the moment
let's just keep it there for the moment
I feel a lot happier in pen mode
so if you draw a circle you will get a circle on the screen
I have no idea what that is about
you can set the pen up so that the different click
YouTube there's going to be loads and loads of things on there too now
I like to draw on paper mostly and but I do coloring on Photoshop
there we go so this is a pencil and we can choose up here
you are gonna have so much fun learning what this is all about
I have no idea there is so much here for you to learn
this is free and this is not amateur at all
I've no idea what these things are for timeline
so that obviously means that you can do animations on here as well
this looks like an amazing program to get you started and with the
I discovered something really really cool about them now
why would you need to spare nibs well
they haven't paid me to make this video but can
I certainly can if you are a hobby digital painter or hobby somebody
I'll tell you one thing I don't actually use among us at all
I since I swapped over to using a Wacom pen no problem at all
we've got applications that are sort of desktop style
applications and the Windows Start screen support for all sorts of touchscreen applications
and again it runs the full windows desktop style
I think it's a little bit of a tougher
maybe you can get a little bit more than I have
which is what you tend to find in the cheaper
it's got a nice build quality on the tablet the keyboard section
windows button power and volume keys front-facing stereo speakers a front facing webcam
we can do some typing so type in works just fine
this is if you didn't even do that
everything gets really tiny and hard to read
you might not necessarily need to do that but while
I do like the option of being able to say
put two windows side-by-side and a web browser
I'd rather be able to read the text
they're not the best sounding that I've heard but they'll do in opinions
10 which has continuum for switching back and forth between tablet and desktop modes
it goes away but it can be a little bit disconcerting
did it can still get a little awkward from time to time so anyways
I'm not sure how often you're likely to do that anyway
yeah there's pressure sensitivity about 8000 levels of it
we'll see more on that in a minute
there is a price to pay for that often times
so let's take a look at this thing
let's dive in and see what it's like to draw with
I'll put a link it down in the description for that
that's the space on the display that you can draw on
my point is is this is the size that I like to draw
it's really light and thin but also sturdy
it's made of plastic and it's the type of plastic
you would expect in a fairly inexpensive device like this
it doesn't feel premium but it doesn't feel bad either
but you're probably not buying this to take pictures of it
what are these numbers yelled grandpa bear as he guzzled his porridge
what the heck is a soft keys screamed
and they're customizable just like the other shortcut keys
I went in and I set them to a whole bunch of different shortcuts
okay you just tap them to switch between tools it's fine
it has some tooth there so it gives it a very natural drawing feel
at a good rate it holds that pressure
it's going to be more than adequate so using this on
you don't need any apps it just works
you can't go in and change your shortcut keys but out of the box
I was pretty impressed with how well this works
this tablet in sketchbook is legit pressure is working and it's working
it's a cheaper smaller version of this tablet
going with the lower-priced tablet all right now
I was wondering since this works on Android
would it work on a Chromebook Chromebooks can run Android apps
I wonder if have a Chromebook sitting around here somewhere
I have to talk to you again beep
Chromebooks to work with and do papers on and and surf the Internet
what kind of drawing hardware can I get for this Chromebook
I plug this in and it kind of works again
sketchbook is pretty decent and I get some good lines here
there is no pressure sensitivity here if you need pressure sensitivity
I don't think this is gonna work for you
that is a big feature of a drawing tablet
let me know down below in the comment section
I'll see you in a couple of days
and considering that you're getting a such a huge tablet for just 900 rupees
it can be used by kids to practice
work your circles perspective concepts you get the idea
and we have the tablet itself over here
yes this is the lock and unlock button
it's got a nice weight to it and it feels kind of natural
i think it's quite natural to know like right over this
you are going to get your sensitivity as you can see with less pressure
i don't think you can see that in the camera
or if you're an artist you can just practice some nice line work
i would say right you can practice your line work
i would say i think this feels really good
is that in most of the tablets or things like that
there is no thing like the line is catching up to the stylus right
it is just you put down drag it just follows it instantaneously
there is absolutely no law no lag or anything and as i mentioned
let's say this is a network you can just uh where is that
i would say i've just unlocked it now
they say that the battery which is inserted over here
i think it's two of the coin batteries
i will be happy if the tablet lasts one or two years for me
i don't think the battery should last that long though
i would say and you can also take out your ruler
so yeah i think that's it for this video
thank you so much for watching and see you bye
I'm very impressed with the quality of the product
so here is the specs of the tablet
I can say it's very simple and clean
I'm using the tablet and it's very smooth
I have used this tablet and it was functioning really well
it is my first time using it and still
I feel like I have been using it for a while
and it's really good so in terms of performance wise
there's nothing wrong with this tablet and one more thing that
which you can customize so practically right now
I kept it like that and under work area
it's just one thick line so the best option in the middle region
I have used the tablet to create this
the tablet than the mouse and this has been really shift in my workflow
so here's a my latest editing file where
I would like to have is the wireless support
it will make this tablet a perfect graphic tablet
hi everyone this video is going to be a review of the who
thank you so much for sending it to me
I had a lot of fun playing around with it and testing it out
all the packaging is black and has little silver icons showing
so the main items that came in the box was a tablet itself
stand a box on there the install disc and the Quick Start Guide
we're kind of on top of each other
there's a link in the description to the to the Amazon page
it is a wireless tablet but you can use it plugged
it has to be recharged and it lasts longer than all the other
it doesn't have an eraser on it but I never really use that anyway
stand as well if you want to store it in there
my computer is just like a regular laptop
it's like 4 years old and I didn't have any problems with the tablet
I'm more used to using a display tablet
so it was a little bit awkward for me to switch to this
I got but I thought that was kind of interesting
US dollars for being so large and so comfortable to work with overall
I have no problems connecting it to my computer
I've always wanted to try one of whom's tablets because I've only tried other
brands have never tried too young before so
I'm really happy that I got this opportunity
so thank you so much to who young for sending me this
if you have any questions please leave them in the comments
you're watching our hands-on review of the dragon touch k10
so what specs you get for just $100 tablet
we have a micro USB cable for charging and a AC power adapter there
seems like there is a pre-applied screen protector
French layer here the first impressions as we are proceeding through
the top houses a microUSB port for charging and a micro
so if you pointed out the light just right you can see
you can see there's no bloatware at all
I think part of the reason is because of that
it's actually a pretty good size in my testing
let's take a quick look at the speakers and video streaming from YouTube
next pausing things there takeaway is the speakers
I would say for watching some quick YouTube videos
it's loading back the desktop site of the verge and you can see
some parts are taking a few seconds longer than maybe a flagship smartphone
Play Store you can see just loads up really quickly here
that's a little lighter and it will run it back without any problems
I would say that the quality has definitely improved significantly
Q @os reviews that's been the dragon touch K 10
he goes so go front camera as well at the bottom
you got the back button and the home button
he has the volume up and down button
I'm just gonna switch it on so you can see
that's how he switches on on the left side
it has a speaker okay and to speak as you can see
and at the top we have takes a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and micro
okay so let me show you some few things
so wall of about this tablet is that is slim
you got a big screen easy to use
he's so one thing is that you got a 10.1
x 1200 pixel it also has the IPS technology Bouin with a multi-touch screen
I can go to saying that we'll just show you something
this the size of the sliminess of this is a eight point
if there's any technical folks now you can see the advanced features
okay and the security is you see here
I go those have information like the connection
the sound their notification the display their wallpaper etc
okay so you got quite of good features boo in
well the main figure that the screen is perfect
okay and it's very smooth to use honestly overall with avocado brands mostly
okay please do give a like and subscribe
they range from $800 to $3,000 and they are super expensive
I could find that was pretty comparable to this
talent was Rackham Cintiq 13 HD interactive pen display and so
Wacom tablets that are newer and they're way more expensive
I found one that was about 16 inches I think and it was
I'm thinking that a lot of people who aren't really professionals
and they have to use the tablet like that for their living
I was thinking that display tablets are really cool
I don't use the expressed keys on tablets
it's kind of hard for me to use those
I used them for about half of the drawing then
you can adjust the tablet to be almost horizontal to your table or vertical
and it's just it depends on however you wish to have it
some kind of knocking down her design to kind of basic
I really want to let you know about before you buy this
just because when the tablet arrived for me
just make sure that it has a mini display port or an HDMI port
install the tablet restart your computer and everything is good to go
I really have no complaints for this tablet
the buttons everything was fine and connected perfectly to my computer
I will talk to you guys in my next video
I'm gonna be taking a look at the new huion inspire a h4 30p
I have a lot of good things to say about this thing
is this nice white box containing your inspiration
USB this time around so here's to the Hat
the net weight is a hundred and thirty five grams or for you
they've done this because you should always download the drivers on the website
they're the most up-to-date and the most helpful
ok let's get to the real meat and potatoes of this unboxing
so the tablet comes in this nice cover which gives it a more pre
I guess I don't know it's a really nice addition but upon first impressions
I noticed that the tablet was very light lighter than I was expecting
we have the pen which is going along with the theme of
oh my god this is lighter than I was expecting
Wacom pen but it's about the same with the XP pen
it has a very nice design and grip to it
ok now that we have the unboxing out of the way
so the huion tablet drivers they're easy to install and from what
one point 0.171 204 so if anything changes in the future
you can bind it to whatever you want
this won't really be important to you next
I think you also have a pressure test again
this is mainly gonna be useful for the artists out there
you do need to push the apply button
but that's pretty much to be expected okay
now that we have the drivers out of the way
let's get into game play now onto my impressions
I'm 93 K and when I started using the tablet
I think it 116 K so I've had no problem advancing at all
you really won't have any problems with this
the drivers were extremely easy to set up
it only took me about 30 minutes to adjust to this tablet
I just I kind of like this pen a bit more when playing
I haven't noticed really any input like I mean
I really don't have many gripes with this tablet at all
there was going from the 480 to this
I really can't recommend this enough as a first tablet
I don't really know if I can recommend it
I don't know about more experienced players but the average player
so take advantage of it while you can
just a heads up to my patrons and any future patrons
we're watching the macGruber movie but yeah thanks for watching guys
this was a lot of fun to make
anyway the edge comes in a few configurations
it maintained a steady 30 frames per second
Crysis 3 still looks incredible for less demanding titles like Tomb Raider
the settings can be cranked up too high without dipping below 30fps
3 Far Cry 3 XCOM and countless others with great results
naturally gaming has a significant impact on battery life
for general tablet use the edge gets roughly 5 to 6 hours per charge
it has a critical impact on speed and precision in shooters and action titles
I always had to have edge and gamepad propped up on my lap
it could be great but it's not quite there yet
Android tablets aren't really setting the world on fire these days
inch tablets running an almost completely stock version of Android 9pi
first it's important to keep something in mind throughout this review
inch tablet most definitely does this device has a 10.1 inch IPS
they sound more like the speakers you find in greeting cards
which would essentially allow for apps to be installed onto the card
and let me tell you that little combo right
I'm not even sure what a camera this bad is
which would have actually lowered the tablet price
even more in my opinion same could be said for the 0.3
they're lightweight titanium wrap headbands that use wireless bluetooth 4.1 connectivity and multi-point pairing
but you aren't buying this tablet for photos anyway right
Nasir and their to be expected I would say doing the verge
test is always a great way to see
switching between chrome tabs takes a second or two but it does manage
it's not really the end of the world now as for games
crush is gonna be fine one of my all-time favorite mobile games
Sky Force reloaded ran surprisingly well on this
I had a hard time stopping and playing
and maybe it would be depending on your kid
it's passable though again that Battery depletes so quickly
Vudu library was easy to browse and view
Amazon rival the Fire HD 8 and 10 inch tablets
there might best sum up my time with the on
10.1 inch tablet as long as you understand what you're getting
maybe you won't be disappointed but really don't expect much yes it runs vanilla
Android yes it technically does tablet II things and yes

so this is a pen tablet drawing tablet
i have actually reviewed the previous model before the non-pro the m106k non-pro now
let's take a look at the things that i included first here
we have the thank you card warranty card
connect the tablet to your android phone or tablets
it's comfortable to hold with the large rubber grip
buttons on the side feedback is quite firm and when you press the button
that you can also customize you can assess them with the pen
this drawing area is 10 by 6 which is considered a medium size
there's this little sleeve for holding the pen
and now let's see what the driver can do
soft keys you can assign specific keyboard shortcuts
and this is where you can change the rotation the orientation of the tablet
this time with the samsung tablet in vertical mode
there is another issue here so this time around
if you guys have any questions let me know in comment section below
hey Teddy K here for Best Buy plugin and in this video review
this is a two-in-one convertible in the first place
of course being a two-in-one convertible means that you can separate the two
there's got the the pin connector in the middle
that's basically what you need and closing it up is pretty straightforward too
I want to get into battery life a little bit here
you're gonna have to pump that up a little bit now notice when
I do that so if I go to a higher number
I'm going to show you in a second here
what happens so now as the unit is made the adjustments so
I've gone to 100% and now I'm down to 4 hours right
you don't have to be 100% that's pretty high
ok so together here we have the 2 flex devices
now why are we bringing these together so what
time running certain apps on the 8 on the 11 inch
be better on the 11 inch as well but here there you have it
in this video we're gonna look at the van
Keogh matrix pad z10 10.1 inch Android tablet
I just want to give a big shout-out to van Keogh
they sent me this as a review unit and
I'm really excited to get this thing opened now
let's go ahead and take a look at the box
it actually has a really nice sleek design
open all right so right away in the box
so that's nice that they've included it and we can go ahead and peel
we actually have plastic encasing there and I'm assuming the reason that they've done
we've got a 13 megapixel rear camera and a 5 megapixel front camera
but it does have expandable memory up to 128 gigabytes with a micro
so you'll have more than sufficient potential for memory if you need it
I've ever seen but I've definitely seen much thicker
USB charging port we have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
we've also got a really small reset button
I found that the display is actually really really nice
US dollars which is actually a really good price
so that's really cool too in terms of performance regular web browsing
we want to see how well this thing can perform with basic emulation
I think we might actually be able to get Dreamcast
I might get a lot of hate for saying that
it was my first platforming game on the ps1 so
we can see that it also plays really well
we don't have any graphical errors and there's definitely no slowdown or lag
it's totally capable of playing your favorite PlayStation 1 games
we're gonna go ahead and take a look at another game in this case
Dreamcast running on this thing so the app I used for
Dreamcast emulator and this is what I found to be the absolute best
Dreamcast through retroarch and it was an absolute failure
don't think that it's perfect because are some slowdowns that
it ran really really well very smoothly and it didn't have any hiccups
it was totally playable and there wasn't any major issues
there was the occasional slowdown from time to time
but it really wasn't that big of a deal and then finally
it ran actually fairly well and it was completely playable
shin boudic ion here and the game ran really well
I did test out Kingdom Hearts and it was hit or miss
I've got for you for this video again
I really appreciate it and thank you guys for watching the video
I'll talk to you guys again real soon
we're gonna be taking a look at the all new
the standard version does come in a little cheaper
I'm going to go ahead and boot it up for the first time now
so if you don't mind spending a little extra cash
our RAM the Plus version and two gigs of RAM
tablets aren't gonna win any awards but they will get you by
this is an 8 inch 1280 by 800 IPS display and for the price
AC Wi-Fi so we can pick up at that 5 gigahertz network bluetooth
so we do have a significantly more powerful
unfortunately this does not run on the older HD 8
10 HD total score on that 126,000 632 and our GPU was around 30000
and then we'll move right into some emulation with the new fire eight
I'm getting an average of around 30 FPS with 8 chunks
FPS is just fine for a mobile device
I got a few more games to test here
this performance is great where you got a constant 60fps
so in the end with the new 2020
and they go on sale all the time for around 99 bucks so personally
but that's it for this video really appreciate you watching
hello everyone welcome back to my youtube channel
so today we are reviewing the amazon fire hd 10
this is the 32 gigabyte 1080p with alexa
you guys can get higher data storage if you need to
so sometimes they have sales so definitely look around the holidays
if you can wait if you cannot wait
this is actually the second one that i'm reviewing
we got internet and everything linked to this
we can go ahead and watch different tv shows on here
you know you got all this stuff disney showtime star sling
just all this stuff games books just so much you guys can do
and it's just a great tablet you know
i highly recommend it for the price you know
the tablet definitely gets a 10 out of 10.
how awesome it is definitely check out the link in my video description
i've seen it at one hundred dollars honestly at all those price points
Kobo tablet obviously saw that I mentioned their products in one of their videos
and they've actually sent me one here to have a look at so
you find a nice little letter with discount for next time
you shop on their store which is nice as well as some instructions
basically they've just got them on these sheets now
obviously when you buy it it has all those on there
I've just pulled some out for the demo phrase that I've done here
some of these letters had actually already moved around in transit
but that's not an issue of the Coburn tablet
Kobo tablet does not come with numbers or symbols so this Kobo tablet
I've used in the past when I keep key videos
we'd basically just pop out the letters we need and stick them in there
just based off the first four letters all right so once
I'm doing this this and that but just for the purposes of this demo
I'm not going to worry about that once
I think that his extreme tests actually go way
you can still buy two of these for the price of one of these
I think this is a really good value buy
subscribe if you'd like to be kept in the loop about future content
stay safe in the crypto space and to recover if they get into trouble
Jax and today we'll be unboxing and reviewing the huion
I get asked questions about buying tablets on a budget
I've never used their tablets until of course today
so here we have the brand-new tablet right out of the post
put that to the side and we'll be using that later at the CD
we can download the relevant drivers for the tablet
can't just take it out the little slip here and first things first
they did remark on how actually quite small it is and yeah
I can do a little size comparison as well
I would say half the size of the Wacom arch so just first impressions
we have a little instruction guide that go through all the basics
that's a boy but everything seems to be pretty self-explanatory
I'm gonna install it now and I'll be back with the settings
I think that I always forget or I just don't really want to like
I can't be bothered and you know I figure it's fine
it worked fine but then it never does and it's because
I never removed her old drivers so once I did that
I wanted to get into the drawing so here
I'll just be drawing this exact same character of mine
you know it's a science experiment now for the rest of this video
I'll kind of jump in and out of time lapse at the beginning
that being said using this tiny tablet with a giant screen
I could definitely feel a loss of accuracy in my brushstrokes
exactly where the brushstroke was going to go and I could imagine that
you can definitely see the different levels of pressure sensitivity
I would say the calibration definitely caters to people with lighter grips
which for some reason my mouse just didn't want to do so
having that was a nice bonus a couple of things
the stylus doesn't need to be recharged or anything
holder is also pretty cool and actually really really enjoyed using the pen
it will be perfect because this tablet hardly takes up any desk space
I will recommend saving up bit more money to buy something a little bigger
if you're interested again this is the huion h6 for 0
thank you so much for watching this video
subscribe to my channel for more reviews speedpaint
this particular model has a 32 watt hour battery
it's got an Intel Atom 3 7 7 0 quad-core processor
it's one of the fastest bay trail systems that
work pretty nicely on that full HD display
it's it's like a thin enlight notebook with a full
you can find some more detailed benchmark breakdowns
let's go ahead and turn the volume down here
I haven't had problems running multiple out side by side
it's not necessarily as fast as something with saya
you know it's not that much slower when it comes to doing
CPU intensive tasks like using handbrake to encode videos
my internet connection is being a little bit on the sluggish side here so
I'm having a hard time getting video to play
let's go ahead and let that run in the background
lets get an open a picture that we can edit
you know it looks good there we can go ahead and zoom into 200%
so it's full screen we can use menus
what happens when we do that in real time here
that's a device that doesn't have all the perks
CPUs you've got two removable batteries on the back
we'll talk about how well it actually does there
it's matte and even has a polarizer so yeah that's pretty interesting stuff
of course you might want a keyboard so enter this incredibly rugged
you can actually probably hurt somebody with this
it's submerging it in water and going swimming
that's why we're still an eighth trend because we don't have
gigs of ddr3 low-power RAM and it has an m2 nvme
so that's a bit more modern than you might have guessed from
though you know honestly the jump between 8th and 10th gen
HD resolution and an 11 point 6 inches
this is not for photoshop jockeys obviously this is a very specialized counter product
bright and again it has a polarizer on the screen
but when you look at it it actually doesn't look that way
I think it's a function of the display being driven as such high brightness
it is a tablet after all and also a pen now
not like you're making any compromises with some flimsy tablet
optionally if you want a 90 watt charger
you can just put one and if you want you can put both in
HD resolution power consumption is not too high
SSD if you wish to do upgrades on it
hi everyone this is to offer on pocket blocks calm
Rhian has sent me another tablet to check out so today
they make a lot of tablets of different sizes different features now today
Scott and in this box has the stylus pen
I'm going to show them to you one by one
it measures around 11 inches wide and 7 inches in height
the big quality is alright it has very little flex
let me show you what on this side here
that is the pot for the power cable
this is the on/off switch and on the other side there
switch which will lock your physical shortcut button if you want to
these are the two cables that are provided
the surface finishing is met feels quite good in hand
I'm not too sure of their battery life
it's right here so you can just put dollars like this
we just put this back in all right now
is the time for me to test the tablet
I'm not sure why you want to do that though
and there's no way for me to actually drag on the curve itself now
sensitivity personally are not able to differentiate between 4,000 and 8,000 levels of pressure
the tablet cannot be used when you are charging the battery
it's still able to detect the stylus but the stylus cannot move
this is photoshop cs5 on the Mac and right now
you can only know that if you compare them side-by-side but here
well enough for me let me show you the transition between thin and thick
it's a brush now in order to get the pressure sensitivity to work
there is no lack so this is great and right now
it has a lot of tools and brushes that's dedicated to calming
there's a sharp drop in the thickness but for some other strokes
I guess we're doing cross hatching or hatching lines like this
let me jump over to try a few sketches pro now font
and this is the guest now at this screen
the tablet it doesn't work because the driver hasn't loaded yet
Pro sometimes the brush they would behave a bit
I wasn't able to draw all my lines very smoothly
so if you are having this problem maybe this is the solution
so that's all thanks for watching you in the next video bye you
here and welcome back to another product review in this video
we're gonna be looking at this little thing
this is a another new tablet from bike
I believe what is this one at least is there a 30 or so
but we're gonna go over to some footage of me unboxing this thing so
I can talk to you about some specs and stuff like that
let's get to that alright so right off the bat
they did form fit this thing pretty well but I do like that
it's wrapped in some very good protective materials
I think more these graphics tablets should have that
I have a little ninety degree on there so good job Mike next
we have the pen which is a battery list pen
so there's no battery that is required and it's in a nice little case
it's kind of like a nice little like felt or something
it looks exactly like the one from the other bike
they could probably do this a little better
I start getting stuff out now with that battle the way
she is a beaut she's very shiny looking
I really like the just the overall design
got your product information all that stuff so yeah
let's move over to installing the drivers now
we're gonna take a look at downloading the drivers
sorry that my in my overlays gotten in the way
that is something that they say in the guide
which are those little keys there on the side there
so that's this little pad thing allows you to zoom so
I can easily just kind of do that to zoom which is nice
do work they just take a little getting used to
oh yeah so just to quickly like sketch something out
I'm whoa I am so used to this at all
please do not judge me too harshly because god
Oh God okay but I am trying to be fair here
it has a nice kind of feel to it
that eyes all kinds of what got a nice feel to it definitely
I think you'll have no problems with this
it's working very well as you can see
looks like there's like a very small very subtle wiggle and
I'm I'm fairly certain that that is this ruler
I think it'll be great for anyone who's really trying to start out
I would have is these these buttons need actual like they're not actual buttons
they're just touch kind of like touch pads
they're a little like plus marks but they're really hard to see
they put like a little sticker on them
I don't know if that'll affect them or not
so thank you so much for watching this video
I know this was kind of a weird one
I hope you enjoyed if you liked it
I'm gonna be doing more art streams soon so check me out
this is going to be a review video because the company called
so that's what we're gonna talk about today and
can it actually do the job that I need it to do
I don't care if it's the what brand it is
so that's why I have an old iPhone 7
that's you know that's that you're supposed to have in our review
is it good enough for you you suck so
I want to show you this bad boy
it's more of a horizontal format than the standard one
that goes have something like this and the reason
then you might want to have the standard one but I wanted this one
the where the core goes into the tablet itself
don't think they sell them anymore but they sell something
I don't like the new tablets because they have a different surface to them
so the tablet comes in this sturdy-looking package right here
the first the top layer is this layer
the power cable the power adapter and the stand
you also have some instruction on how to install this tablet and
you actually have additional nibs for your pen
it's really easy to adjust to whatever angle
I also really like this little detail here that huion put on the screen
um it's a lot thicker and bulkier than the one
it still works great and now it's just a little bit more original personally
I know how satisfying it can be to watch so here
does it work as well as more well-known tablets
one issue you will always encounter with display
I know it can be annoying for some people in the beginning
I started sketching as soon as I got the HDMI to Thunderbolt adapter
in the mail there are mainly two reasons
I like to see the whole canvas when I'm sketching meaning
Tablas tend to get very warm after a while
I haven't had that issue with the who beyond even after long
sketch sessions of 4 to 5 hours at a time
that's not a problem because I've always used the keyboard
I'm using even if it has a bunch of buttons on the side
I've always had my left hand on the keyboard
I just did while the right hand to do
just click the link below in the description
I think it's time to introduce a new official
hello guys and welcome back to the channel in this video
i just want to say that at the moment
the tablet is running on november 2nd build
also you can now format the sd card as an internal storage
it's faster smoother and more app so compatible than the stock android 7 rom
you can also change the clock style grid layout and of course the wallpaper
i kept getting a network error even though i have internet connection
but that's not really a concern for me anyway
i just thought that i should mention that
thank you for watching this video if you enjoyed it
OS 7 operating system based on Android 9 and
and on the meantime offer a great tablet experience the more
I started liking it after using it for a couple of weeks
it's the Lenovo tab for another great tablet is the Lenovo tab 4
it has a vivid display and a comfortable design
the soft touch plastic makes this tablet very comfortable
however it's still good to watch videos and movies
I should also mention that it has amazing battery life
it started to lag however it still didn't disappoint me
I realized that it actually delivers great qualities
I'm sure it'll solve your problems without hesitation
I will give this tablet 4 out of 5 stars
s8 is another amazing tablet with its beautiful and simple design
this one is definitely one of the most valuable tablets in the market
you want you can also add up to 128 gigabytes with a micro
SD card and when it comes to the processor
it has a quad-core 64-bit intel atom z3580 processor
i used the zed stylus and did some sketching and design work
I had fun to be honest and then I started to open up tabs
I wanted to know how much this tablet can handle
it did a great job with no lags at all
I think that this tablet is worth it at number two
the thing is that they didn't stop there and delivered us
Oh Jack users because this one doesn't have one
Hardware it doesn't support Netflix or 1080 the display like I said is amazing
make me spend even more time using the media pad m5 it
the only disadvantage is that it doesn't have a 3.5
millimeter jack and it feels a bit weird when you use it vertically
I would highly recommend this tablet to the people who want an amazing display
Samsung is one of the best to ever produce this Cayenne device
even though it isn't expensive it has many great features
it's perfect for every type of tablet user
this tablet feels and looks a lot like the tablets that are very expensive
I played some games and I can't say that I had a great time
it really is simple to use and feels comfortable enough
you don't have to bring your charger everywhere
you go after using it for a couple of days
LTE as you might expect at those price points
it is a direct competitor to the cheaper
eight millimeters and lighter with 250 4 grams so than the Amazon fire 7
on the right side we get a power button and volume controls
and you can use microSD cards as internal storage
we get one speaker which is located above the screen
it's a 7 inch screen with a resolution of 1024 by 1600
that sounds really bad but actually is still usable
the screen is noticeably better than the one from the fire
I've got the 80 version and as you can see in my benchmark
I suggest you get 60 gigabyte as well out of the box
I guess that happens due to the one
I had to wait quite often doing my review of this tablet
let's get to something more positive and that is a software really
Nova types of essentialist one in android 7.0 nougat but
I don't think that there will ever be a major software update
UI is almost not customized at all and that is great
I'm really not sure how Lenovo is measuring that
I recommend really know what have 7 essential sadly for most
I also like that we almost get vanilla Android and the battery
life is great for such a cheap tablet
Lenovo tab for 8 with almost vanilla Android
alright that's my review of the Lenovo Tab 7 essential
so you might be asking what is the
so what's really important about this is you might be wondering okay
they price anywhere between $80 and 250 dollars this device here is only $39
Model T for instance only comes with the twelve twelve word recovery C phrase
so that people can't go in and steal and look your recovery C phrase
I recommend this really for anyone that has over forty dollars
the tiles will kind of have jagged edges
they have different sizes so it was kind of like thrown together
it should be closer to $100 in my opinion
that were lost and what had happened is is he had his recovery
the battery died so the only way that he could recover
backup to your entire crypto bank vault then
I have actually a few of these in fact I have a Kobo vault
I have a metal rack of a receipt
I'll go ahead and leave a link in the description below
and this is the Lenovo ThinkPad x1 tablet
it wasn't everything we'd hoped it would be so take two is something
that's much more modern and very compact very portable
that's really nice reminds me of the samsung galaxy
SSDs ample amount of RAM and some interesting connection modules
we're look at it now so this is the Lenovo ThinkPad x1 tablet
Lenovo's first business tablet is quite some time running
Windows 10 and Intel Core M skylake CPUs
it's a two-part are technically really a three part affair
I asked Lenovo and they said yes indeed
the keyboard will always be in the box
you don't have to hunt the keyboard and you get the full sides
so you can clip it to the side of the tablet for transit
it's actually more effective than the the surface pro
4 uses the tablet ships with a citizen
the tablet has a 12 inch IPS display and
we'll talk about that in depth in a minute
it's an injection molded plastic for the casing
but that's a little abusive to be twisting something like that
lenovo says that the back can be removed to upgrade the internals
SSD should be accessible in there now I tried
there's no service manual out to this yet and
the kickstand is released with the lever over here and it's resistant space
you have to have it at that angle
you can't go down as low as this
the kickstand is stiff enough to be effective
let's put it that way and you can go down this far
ThinkPad keyboard just twelve inches in size a little smaller than normal
I adjusted to it pretty quickly and I found it very pleasant to type
it does show fingerprints and this looks like leather
and that's how it connects to the bottom of the tablet
maybe yes just like surface so you take it we do that
we have more connectors that's because there are optional
modules here lenovo has three in the works
lay your finger on it and that works with
you got your volume controls your headphone jack and the power button
it sticks out a lot really relatively speaking
it's not one of those stiff little buttons
they tend to have actually better front-facing cameras
it's mostly all good news here and Lenovo often falls behind the competition
when it comes to color gamut they usually do pretty good on brightness
this one indeed is both bright really bright 365
that part is good but this is a very very reflective display
this one is not going to do that
it's not ever going to get hot in my experience
warm sometimes no hot and no fans no noise
I add core M has come a long way in
OneNote note taking absolutely not a problem in this office
not a problem if you're going to be using this for Photoshop
but fast storage can mitigate that and we do have
that's a 1.1 gigahertz core M turbo boost higher than this
so don't worry it doesn't spend its whole life running that slowly
computationally that means any computational tasks it's heavy like crunching big spreadsheets in
it's going to take a bit longer but again it's it's been fluid
so keep that in mind but it's not going to be some
just a different way of executing the kickstand
Wacom AE s-pen branded as the ThinkPad pen
honestly you get palm rejection here though occasionally
it's smooth it's fluid there are levels of pressure sensitivity
I switched to the pencil and you can see
my hands are not on the screen in part because well
I'm not going too fast and how about jitter
I'm not the smoothest slow line line drawer in fact
I'm not seeing a whole lot of terrible jitter there
let's see what happens when we go really fast
mischief usually misses the beginning of my stroke
I'm using the grainy dry brush right now
that's up to the hardware and not the software so that works quite well
where sometimes it can just totally fall far enough behind that
it's a two-piece ensemble you get the keyboard with it
it's not quite as fast as I would like it's bearable
it's okay for a business work for note-taking it's just fine
pro 4 is a little bit of a hard sell
Tom from tech stops here coming your way and today
playbook this is BlackBerry's answer to all the other tablets out there
I did do an unboxing on this product
you may have seen the video if you have it in the description box
feels like it's made of high quality construction and materials
it doesn't feel like it's got a break
it does have two cameras front facing and a rear facing camera
you don't have to use it a full blast like other
the problem with other tablets are the speakers they have is
they're actually on the sides or behind on the rear of tablet
out there that are seven inches or smaller actually have mobile phone software
the multitasking and the gestures work really well
you will note that the PlayBook does support flash which is a huge teeth
well incorporate it in the browser one thing to note with the OS
at this stage the 16 gigabyte version retails for 580 not eighty dollars
there a little bit cheaper and you push them from all large electronic
i'll be happy with that and it does give you a little bit more
Portability and in taken around a little bit easier than the ipad 2
I definitely consider you guys checking them out
sup guys cerebro here with t3g bringing you another review this time
I'd try it out see what's going on
I wanted to know the 10 inch I wanted an Android
why not a tiger right check it out so
sorry so found this bad 190 bucks one gig of ram
SD card slot as I saw her the display
never never too happy about that but I took a look at the display
I'm not doing fancy stuff with 10 fingers and I you do stuff
so we've got a large section here under the tablet pop that up
it's actually nice and padded so during shipping and transport to your home
and that's pretty much it for that section
which has our sadly non-standard charger but it's cheaper
I'll say why let's touch the hardware first on the back
we've got that back the rear facing camera we have our speakers
they're decent nothing nothing to write home about
you've got your power and volume rocker up
top and yet another horizontally oriented tablet for a reader
the ports are on the side so we have
I actually didn't see that indicated anywhere besides right
there had actually gotten like this person back happen that your mini HDMI port
it's a lower-end tablet but I still wanted to see how it works
I went ahead is I downloaded smart washer
my standard four point one launcher was still on the system which
this is an older model and their new
Pro or prestige 10 d or G or an or Saturn something
I think it's prestige tending it does have Google Play according to the website
I'm actually gonna show this on there anymore so with Google Play
it comes with the one apps marketplace and get jar
I don't know I don't know what did what to call it
I I'd rather try for something that already
find for the 90 bucks absolutely pick it up cuz why not me
got a couple fun videos coming up for you guys stay tuned you
Matthew Bonas here and right in front of you have Lenovo ThinkPad x1 tablet
this is the hybrid version of the x1 carbon
you're gonna get more mileage out of the x1 tablet
the hinge on the back is built into the tablet
I never recommend a hybrid laptop that uses the case as a hinge
I find those designs to be very poor and offer a very janky experience
I just want to talk about the pen for one second
I didn't have any latency and writing and drawing on it was great
everything is pretty much soldered on to the motherboard
but you can't swap out the m2 nvme
it's qhd+ three thousand by two thousand resolutions
so exactly like the surface pro that means when it comes to productivity
you're gonna get a lot more mileage out of this display
I can't say the same thing about the front-facing 2-megapixel camera
it feels like a potato and quite frankly
I don't understand why business laptops have bad webcams
you're using this thing to videoconference with your taking this into meetings
the keyboard on the x1 tablet is great for a hybrid laptop personally
it is better than the one on the surface pro
my unit is spent with the i-5 8250 you
so that means you get two more cores compared to last year
which makes it great for things that can utilize it so
League of Legends or even overwatch on very low settings in terms of heat
I'd be kind of concerned but overall this laptop handles heat very well
there was no thermal throttling and even under full load
the fans kept nice and quiet now when it comes to a battery life
that's where things started looking a little bit different
the lenovo x1 tablet is a fantastic hybrid business
I think the x1 carbon is a better buy
let me know your thoughts on the x1 tablet in the comments below
if you enjoyed this video feel free to hit the like button
we're taking a look today at the new refreshed
all of the opinions you're about to hear are my own
so let's take a closer look now at the hardware
this is 149 dollars for the 32 gigabyte version for that price
though you're going to be getting ads on the lockscreen like this so
I've seen a bunch of different ads some from Amazon
they're trying to sell me an accurate earlier as well
the tablet cost one hundred and sixty-five dollars
it is 1.1 pounds that is about 503 grams
this is running at 1900 by 1200 which is the same that the prior
Edition was running at things are really super sharp
the processor inside is the big story of this one
it'll take up to a 512 gigabyte microSD card
the camera system on here is not spectacular
you do though have two two megapixel cameras
but it's still not great so this one's now 2 megapixel
excuse me the rear camera is also a 2 megapixel shooter again
we're just going to browse the nasa.gov homepage here and you can see
things are springing up very very quickly on it
I've been overall just pleased with just how snappy and responsive everything is is
Android you don't get the Google Play Store Amazon
Play that app will have to be repurchased on this now
so you can issue the a-word commands to it
we're going to mute out the a word so
let's check that out now if you prefer this to be an Amazon echo
they will be quite happy with what they're going to get out of this
we also took a look at some game emulation
and this is one of the more challenging emulators on the Android platform
they chose to put inside of it again
you're not going to get twelve hours out of it
that 7-inch only comes with a 90-day warranty
so it's just a good deal and something worth considering
i am going to do a quick review
make sure to ask them in the comments
I'll try to reply to every single one of you
don't worry it all go back to focusing on my thing soon okay okay
it's the pin so you got a USB
I'm guessing that's the plug that plugs into it
it's got a rubber grip so you hold onto it quite nicely
yeah that's three it's eight nibs eight spin-ups
it's in a bag so I guess we'll get to that last
I guess and this is instructions blah blah blah
it doesn't look like it actually did come with a glove which
but that's fine if it doesn't come with it
so you pretty select five bucks or something
I guess that's just instructions for how to though I Drive a manual ears
oh you have to download the drivers online
it's called instructions so and we need that
but here's the drawing tablet in a bag guys so here it is
I think this bit here is for the pin to like so like
hold your pen I guess or you can I call it by there
that code but there is 16 of those so it looks very cool
it feels really good so yeah it looks cool feels good
I guess I could try to plug it
i think actually hold up a sec guys
I would say I'd say it's a meter cable long enough
it's also got these little rubber bits on the back
I can't tell rub a bit on the back
I think I just need to download the drivers as definitely unless they like
anything like that then that would get broken but apart from that
so you guys if you're either ever getting a package from
well it's turning on so it basically shows this
I'm not 100% sure what hotkeys I want
or however you want to pray on so yeah okay
so it's that one right there that button right
there is going to be used a lot for gone
I've never done this sort of thing for
and so you've got a total of 13 hotkeys that you can have
I finished my drawings and everything so my overall thoughts of it is
it's really nice and comfortable to use for long periods of time
it's really comfortable so I definitely recommend it to you guys
I feel looking for a mid-range tablet to buy
I definitely recommend it by the way guys
I'll see you guys next time I guess
it is one of the most powerful kids tablets out right now today
it is thin and fairly lightweight given its appearance
the knobby is white with non-functioning red buttons in the corners
they look like they could provide some extra grip
but their main purpose is to customize the tablet with various accessories overall
one of the most important factors especially with a higher priced product
Nabi mode was well laid out and intuitive eight
let's the Nabi 2 features something called spin
it is all kid-friendly apps games and downloads
well laid out and fun to use plenty of parental control features
here and today we are back with another review this time
we're going to be looking at the 2019 version of samsung's galaxy tab a
tab a comes in three separate colors i have the black here notice
a little two-tone with your camera up here down bottom
but it's going to be a good picture
and it has samsung one ui over that as far as camera
up front takes pretty decent pictures but most of the times
now you notice you still get those nice vibrant colors on here screen
it actually does everything that it's supposed to be doing
now i know a lot of people are going to say
hey i play um fortnite or i play pub g on my tablet
everything looks good when you want to get out of here
it's a pretty solid tablet and for under 300 bucks
this is basically going to be the tablet for that person
we'll check out these resolutions so it starts out at 480.
we we can actually go up to 1080 at 60 frames per second
be sure and give me that thumbs up
so let's dive five feet deep into Sony's nest and it's late
Starbucks says when you're holding an aluminum iPad air for instance
it's not right under your thumb tip so you can't press
those flaps fit very tightly and a soft flush with decided
if they weren't marked you'd be looking around for them for quite some time
fir that are set to produce brighter and more evenly spread lighting
P is more than enough for most purposes
and especially annoying if you use the tablet outdoors despite the decent 414
Sony uses its Xperia interface on top of Android 4.4
there isn't much difference from the previous experience and Sony's two offers
and you can fire up to five such resizable windows
which is a decent way to multitask on the tablet if needed
Sony's new catwalk model is powered by a fast 2.3 gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon 801
needless to say it improved processing power results in a fluid browser performance
there are no hiccups while panning around scrolling or zooming in and out
Adobe Flash support you'd have to look for third parties options
there are two versions of the tablet based on the connectivity options
the tablet sports this infrared sensor at the top managed by dedicated apps
editing modes that can be used from within the apps interface
that only happens when the talat is paired with
the tablet shoots in a wide 16 by 9 aspect ratio
the pictures come out with a vivid color representation
but that's large expected with such camera indoors
we get smooth 30 frames per second 1080p
some recorded with the video is strong and clean
Sora's Xperia z2 tablet is a great improvement over its record-setting predecessor
it is even thinner with a much faster chipset and a better display also
the slimmer slide is 10-inch tablet on the fly
there are only a few issues with the z2 tablet chief
outdoors the pixel density also leaves something to be desired
the jet pro has a high-resolution display and a new magazine
UX with an excellent split-screen multitasking mode for the interface
it is less compact in the z2 tablet however and isn't waterproof
I'll test the best 10 inch and wit slate
so we may not see another version of these in 2020
starting at number 9 we have the one by
there is a smaller version of the one by
Wacom does not offer a display that you draw directly onto instead
and there's an option for connecting the tablet to your computer wirelessly with bluetooth
you can even connect the end to us to select
the intros is twice as expensive as the one by
Pro has a whopping active area of twelve point
one by eight point four inches because it's pro it's obviously more professional
you can make the same quality art on the one by
you will need to connect it to your device with a video cable
well you can do basic digital painting and drawing making art on
both sizes of this tablet are great but as you know
I prefer a large drawing surface so clearly
s-- require an hdmi video connection to a Mac or Windows computer
13 is only a bit more expensive than the non pro
the stand can make a difference in terms of comfort
I absolutely love it for painting outdoors or while traveling
the sixteen inch version of the mobile studio pro does support
a powerful desktop is going to provide the snappiest performance
and if you do need to zoom pan or rotate the Cintiq
HD screen resolution the color gamut accuracy on the Cintiq pro
they also have folding legs like the smaller
Wacom ergo stand and then there's the Wacom branded ergo flexor guitar on arm
I prefer the arm but both stands are great
these tablets are overkill for a beginner or hobbyist
I know that's not the case now to be fair
so topping the list at number one is the
that has the same pressure levels as my high-end
so it's not as elegant of a connection as the single
I'd say if you can find a use two
if you'd like to watch in-depth reviews of these drawing tablets
today we have a review of a Chinese tablet via the company X Gobi
we're going to review it right now and beard tech
it's a 9 inch or winner a 33 quad core processor brick
TF card slot and DC charging port and micro USB charging slot
I'll review kingroot in another video coming soon
the screen is only 800 by 480 pixels
either it's smudgy and will scratch with a breath or two on it
you'll curl up into a ball and scream a lot
the cameras are totally awful with the front-facing camera being a zero point
I don't think you've ever seen it work though
I bought this to listen to the radio online in the kitchen
it's slow sluggish bus trailing and even mystifying
they'll say you have a tablet and you say yes
please do that to the daughter mostly to show you anything please
it's recommended you do not buy this thing
I give it zero out of five beard
this is a review of the Xcode 89 3 cube
please want people not to buy it like this video
we've got a lot more reviews coming up soon
we will see you in the next one
I finally broke down and bought a Fire HD tablet
this is week number 13 of my 2019
Ecco series you could check out last year's series up here
I decided to buy one after using it
it excels in some areas and in others
it just doesn't cut it as a tablet
let's see if it's worth it for you
first what do you get with the Fire
Amazon does show ads on the home screen when you wake the device
up to 400 gigabytes with a micro SD card
the packaging does say something about the durability
it is a plastic body with a gorilla glass screen
this thing does have a very durable feel
there are ways around that that I will explore in a future video
you have to have to take you to books
video games shopping apps music audible and newsstand
all these tabs are designed to jump right to amazon's various offerings
I'll get into the show mode features in another video
I went through my iPad to see what I could find in
you can find various music and video streaming apps a few that
Microsoft Outlook there is no Microsoft Office Chrome browser and other apps
now this does have a web browser but it is not Safari or Chrome
and unimpressive so many things can be done today on a good web browser
I find the workarounds are not a good experience
where the Fire HD tablet lacks even with these complaints
this is a tablet under $100 sometimes even under $50 now on to what
I like I do think the strength of the Fire
the layout makes for quick navigation to audiobooks
HD tablet with the doc as an echo show alternative
so who is this for the biggest benefit
I see is using it like an echo show to enhance your echo experience
if you like to read listen to audiobooks watch videos or play games
I do not see this as a device for much beyond those uses
I need to get done to wrap this up even at full price
it is a content device with show mode
let me know your thoughts in the comment section
there's also international links that will take you to your country's Amazon homepage
Haggai so I bought the tablet recently and I wanted to check it out
Lenovo tablet called the Lenovo minx 310 and now and again
Windows 10 tablets to see you know what they bring to the table
I think it's an improvement over the last year's tablets
it's not going to compete with the laptop of a high caliber
it's also fully at which screen here in terms of the responsiveness
the trackpad is a little bit more clicky than what
you know touch of class here at the end of the day
so let's just go into the operating system again so we are running
Windows 10 here no student Edition or anything
we can have a look here at some things I have installed in fact
let's just have a look at the actual general responsiveness
I mean you're not going to be doing much heavy here
Wi-Fi boy does use 2g Wi-Fi very well everything
those are extremely fast just as faster than online
so you can see for web browsing absolutely marvelous
I was a little bit concerned when I first got it
in regards to the available storage you can see after all the updates
it's like down to 8 2 gigs storage
take some space off the main emmc storage
so there's lots of expandability options here you can see is well we get
Here I am using a wireless mouse as well so but it's very usable
you know in terms of you know getting a good game on
I just show you the the speaker as well
let's just turn up so you can see them a bit
I'm dead flying really annoying so you can see it plays pretty well here
it does slow down a little bit when the action heats up
I'm probably new to practice but oh I gotta kill it
well you know considering a very basic spec also
the battery is absolutely fantastic on this thing
today we're gonna be taking a look at the
Lenovo Tab m8f HD the F HD stands for full HD now
some of my regular viewers might be a little confused because recently
it's packing an extra gig of ram over the m8
we have our power button and volume rocker
and the tablet does support up to a 2 terabyte microSD card around back
we have an 8 megapixel camera in a very sleek aluminum design
GPU that was in the HD version three gigabytes of lpddr3 ram
it is a pretty stock version of Android but they have included some blow
it's working great like most new tablets should and just like the m8
I am right now and I'm going to be streaming in 1080p
HBO amazon prime Hulu Netflix and even YouTube video
I want to see how much more powerful this chip is
Geekbench for single core for the eff HD version nine zero nine multi 39:56
and finally we have an 2 to 8 100 1766
it was much higher than the ma HD but again the fire 10 HD
Android gaming here we have King of Fighters all-stars
this really comes down to it having the same exact
Dead or Alive - it's just not going to cut it
I've seen it dip down to around 38 fps in some situations
so it's definitely not going to run every
I'm using the I Pegah 91 67 controller
pega and you'll be good to go but the performance for native
so that's pretty much it for this video guys
the promo code is valid till thirty first december 2020
amazon link is also provided in the description
it has all the cables and other important stuff required to use the tablet
this is very very heavy so handle it with care
you have one wheel so it is a really nice feature
i had already removed this protective film which was on the tablet
now let me show you the contents of this box
then you will get an hdmi to hdmi cable
then this is the power adapter and power cord
if your laptop or computer has the hdmi port
then there is a glove with xp pen branding on it
so these are the things you get along with the tablet
one end to the computer and one end to the tablet
which is full hd to turn it on simply keep your finger here
okay you can check the pen pressure like this
another great thing about this tablet is is its color accuracy
i have currently assigned three features and by default
another one is you can change the brush size with the dial like this
you can use this tablet for multiple purposes
thanks so much for watching bye bye and take care
I go that's Chris here from tick tablets with the remix
I'll be using it now for a couple of weeks
so there's been a few little tiny minor bugs
so the price is quite good for what you get
and it's one of the the best in a TV screens
so you have a very kind of surface to like tablet
I'd love to see more tablets with kickstands
I even actually find it a lot better than my surface 3 keyboard which
but you could see that both of these keyboards have about the same thick
Android tablet it puts in there just like that you can fold that back
which would put the tablet into sleep mode
so that's a tiny little minor little nibble there that
the magnets in there but overall it fits pretty good
you can pop that up straight away just from a quick button
I'll move around a little but it's interfering with it typing
it does come with quite a good application here that I do like
Play and I'm just running actually in the background just a couple of downloads
I'm just going to flip over to the browser here
and there's a webcam on the rear as well that also has a microphone
so that's quickly just closed everything there just so
and there's there's nice leather in there that all runs fine
thank you for watching a video and do subscribe to my channel
I will have more up and coming videos of other tablets from China
pro it's got this built-in kickstand that's adjustable to a number of different angles
holds everything in place nicely and works at a variety of different angles
two USB type-c ports one is USB 3 and the other is Thunderbolt 3
Microsoft Surface tablet full-size USB port and another full-size USB port
and a fingerprint sensor the fingerprint sensor is pretty effective
start to get used to the volume buttons
sit out a little bit from the edge but not too much another thing
that has a quadruple a battery on the inside
I'm not gonna subject you to watching me
click to open context menus so dependent functionality
the tablet has a starting price about seven hundred and ninety nine dollars
that helps this device be relatively energy efficient and relatively cool
this particular model was loaned to me by
it's in the same family as the core
so it's some in terms of day to day performance
it won't necessarily do quite as well on certain benchmark tests but
this display is a 3.2 aspect ratio screen it's a 28 80 by 1920
XO display which is pretty nice for most respects
ok crank that down a little bit you just
I went ahead and installed and it loads and then crashes
I could not get that they into play at all
I'm not sure if that's because of the processor or something else though clearly
Eve says you should be able to get around 8 hours
I get more like 5 or 6 hours of battery life
the keyboard sort of you know covers it and protects it the keyboard
there's plenty of dust and cat hair in the house
I should also point out that this is at 200% scaling
but I think that the 200% recommended scaling works pretty well for most situations
I do think that the performance is pretty good
you can check out some benchmark scores and other details at little of
buting and again you can find more details at lilliputian com
this was sent to me by gearbest for reviewing
but don't worry along with all the pros
I did mention in my own boxing video how I felt
this could be a cheap alternative to walk-ons interest pen tablets
it has an active area of 6 by 3.7 inches and comes with 4
Fuji's m7o 8 has a 10 by 6 interactive area
there's more space to move the drawing hand around around smooth and natural stroke
large active area is also more preferable for large screen resolutions
Express keys to the left and 2 to the right
I don't find having a cable attached a problem
the computer positioned at a distance but with my laptop
it's hard to say how long the battery will last
because it entirely depends on how powerful the battery unit
I also notice the surface of M 708
active area didn't get any scratches from using the pen
I am so going to cover it with black insulating tape
the driver doesn't conflict with any other existing drivers on the map
the settings is also very easy and pretty self-explanatory
there is no delay in the function happening what
straights produced are beautiful and flow of them
the coloring was not my best mainly because
I'm still working on learning how to draw on Photoshop
Wacom tablets produce a tiny amount of jitter
it plugged in and then come back to wake my MacBook
Pro up from sleep and use the n7o 8 straight away
let's talk about how it performs on windows
I try to reinstall the Wacom drivers after you
DS driver have installed it simply made the V's fly ever disappear
I get when pressing an Express key is immediate
the flow of ink from the pen feels really nice
I found whenever I wanted to click on something
in the taskbar the cursor would have a spasm in fact
the pen works flawlessly on the XPS 12
I've got no pressure levels in some programs like medivac
I had 12 have conflicting issues with Uzis drivers
let's have more than others the end 708 on Windows
the tablet is instantly usable as soon as it's plugged in overall
it was nice to use a larger pen tablet
honestly art is about improving step at a time
so there's no reason not to upgrade your tools
hello everyone this is aldrin here and welcome back to another video
i'm absolutely excited to see you guys all and today
i bought for myself and around 900 us dollars
this is the budget gaming laptop according to many reviews
so i'm absolutely excited to get this unboxed
the lioness tech tip unboxing and i'm just really excited
let me just smell this nice smell of plastic and i love it
how do you open this by the way
they should put this in many like budget laptops
when you just unbox this you just lift this up
why okay so what we have is a very badly packed cable
congratulations on your recent lenovo pages and a bunch of you know services stuff
have the safety and warranty guide to this bunch of safety stuff
this is i mean this is quite heavy
i don't think there's anything else inside here
there you go and let's put it aside
let's see if it actually has anything inside
the box itself is quite sturdy as you can see by the way
this laptop is shipped with just this box
of course i'm gonna just clip this in cool
actually this is actually quite heavy so just straight up
oh yes look at this by the way what
you go so we have the laptop itself now first impression is actually
that feels like a laptop which is cool again
uh by the way if you can see the lenovo legion logo over here
you can see that it's kind of what is this shiny polychromatic stuff
here's the i o as you can probably see
we have two large outlets on the back
i'm not sure if it's gigabit or not but it's an ethernet jack
i believe that's power inlet and then there's a kensington lock oopsies
there's two large fans i can see the fan blade
it's a pretty well built piece of plastic and it doesn't feel like this
it feels pretty good and let's get this open
it's slightly green for some reason and the edge
i don't know if you can see or not
okay i can open one hand which is really cool
oh my god this actually feels really nice
uh i really like this kind of texture
oh yes i see why the reviewers say that
this is a good keyboard so this has really good travel
uh it sounds really nice well and um it has really tactile feeling
like it's the clicks are really really obvious
uh there's a promising shot over here on the webcam
you know logo over here you get this
it doesn't feel really like flimsy and all that kind of stuff
i mean if this laptop is any lighter this hinge
uh and let's try to open this up and see if it boosts up
aesthetically the joy 11 feels really bulky and heavy as a tablet
and you wouldn't feel comfortable holding it single-handedly
the tablet has its power volume and windows button placed at the rear
the specs of the jaw 11 is kind of dated in today's standards
the front and rear side of the tablet features the same 2 megapixel camera
and at times i use it for watching netflix
i was of course careful enough not to open too
but i actually do not find it too bad to see screen
brightness is neither too glaring nor dark and the ips panel
the joy 11 gets very warm after a certain duration of usage
i like the fact that this product gives me
- What's the best tablet deal of the year?
I got a lot of requests since a video
They both respond at basically the same time.
Maybe a second apart between the two tablets.
Video load time actually identical between the two.
- [Siri] Matt, I don't really know any good jokes.
None, in fact. - Seriously, they have to reprogram.
The streaming video on the HD 10 is amazing.
Keep in mind, this is not a Kindle.
You guys want to try it at home, it breaks, try it.
I am not going to do this against a hardwood floor
this time, but the tablet sustained the smashes, the floor did not, so...
No crack. And, now let's do the front side down.
You know, guys, this is a stainless steel table.
Totally unscathed, and still, completely touch-responsive. Everything's working.
Oh no, it's my phone that fell. It's fine. (laughs) Still working.
Like, it works, which is absolutely amazing, given that...
Let me show you what the table looks like right now.
Actual indentations, scrapes, marks, the tablecloth was not in particularly good shape.
Look at that. Absolutely fine. The table, not so much.
But I bet it has a lot of ups and downs.
(tablet rings softly) - [Alexa] Shuffling songs by Madilyn Bailey.
That widescreen viewing is particularly good for streaming, and Netflix, and Amazon Prime.
Congratulations goes to, Connor Rebooted, you wanted a Nintendo Switch.
I'm sorry, but congratulations, you just got a free Fire HD 10.
that just watch, who are like, wow, that was, that was interesting.
right here, that'll subscribe you to this channel.
so you can boot it into either Google Android or indeed Windows
it is not a great performer by any means
I'm not impressed at all with the camera
quality but then who takes photos with tablets anyway
we've got an Intel 64-bit quad-core said seven
we've also got a headphone jack and we've got a micro
SD card slot if we look down on the bottom
we've just got a little pinhole microphone just about here
the back of the device looks very very nice
indeed it's in this gray color and overall
I think this is a really good tablet now
it has also got a front-facing camera but what
I think the display is very very good indeed
I think it's a really nice IPS display and that resolution
I think dual-boot tablet is a great option for a lot of people
I like the chamfered edges actually just to touch on this build quality
plus thank you very much for watching if you've got any questions at all
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you in another video very soon
that's a 16 inch screen and yeah it looks pretty good
isn't that bad at all and you can see that in my pen test
obviously if you need to jump ahead to that or you can watch
obviously one of the few drawing tests that
we go looking at the back of the artists all the sixteen box
there's some interesting pieces coming straight out which I'll get to will
I'm left-handed so I want these on the right hand side
which is why you're looking at the tablet upside down
it's a pretty decent feeling pen nice and solidly built
the nib has quite a bit of movement but didn't bother me too much
it's made of a really nice feeling felt
I found a free gift of twenty nibs
twenty nibs is pretty good next up the stand
it has a lot of different adjustable levels
there's an instruction manual as well for the tablet
it's in a few different languages but also in that packet
oh yes you get an artist glove hahahaha again something
sorry I have to take off this article of now because I I just
LPI pen resolution but I'm not so sure that this has pen tilt actually
I'm pushing down and trying to test that you know pressure curve
I'm getting thin when I want thin and getting fast
I don't use lines moving in my test
you should never do that because you will get lag
the parallax and their parallax is virtually zero
I'm happy with the way that this is turned out moving on
so that's the pen test and while that works
I know a lot of you guys like manga and comic books
so yeah because this doesn't have till at least
who here is a big fan of the
drawing tablet is that it's actually really good for line drawing
I found this about some of the budget
I the one thing is from this camera angle
X and learn to draw overall though it was absolutely fine
I did manage to create a nice piece of artwork in the end something
you know just for a nice little sketch and what was
I'm happy to say you can create both on this tablet for me
a tablet like this requires all of my minimum requirements
I used most as you can see by you
know my thumb using that for brush sizes and for the zoom but yes
which things you want but on a day to day basis
that's pretty cool so I'm doing a few different styles here
I think they've come along amazingly well and given how much this tablet cost
you can google that you know your respective countries
comparisons as long as I give you all the information you know
that's right for you go for the biggest screen possible
this is a 15.6 screen and the pen technology as you can see
I can produce some decent art even though you know
it doesn't have the best pen in the world
I'm putting so many different pen tests in here
we're gonna spend just an hour or so during a sketch
but yeah they used to have action figures covered in flocking like fell
I'd like to know what that looks like
here is my final draw test now the reason
it has a stand coming with it but do you know what it is
it's not for you guys who are like me who
Wacom users who you know who have 20 years experience in digital art
it is a tablet made for those just starting out
somebody's life who who's this their first tablet
this is allowing them to start their journey
if that's you out there then you're gonna absolutely love this
you can see the kind of work that I've been able to do
and if you go and look at my portfolio on my website
carol which is one of my favorite books out there so yes
I think this tablet is really good at that but you know I think
I've been on many tablets just like this
a drawing tablet like this would have been a godsend
let me know what you think in the comments about sketches that
let me know what you think about the pen tests everything
let me know what you're using at the moment to create our
I would love to hear your thoughts and comments below
tin and you're watching the review of eyeballed slide i-70 one performance tablet now
Windows 8.1 with 1gb RAM and 16gb of internal storage
pack this tablet is available for a price tag of just rupees 4999
cover a cleaning cloth to clean up this screen
pack is the travel charger along with the microUSB pin the eyeball slide
mAh built-in battery weight with battery is 271 grams
it's a seven inch screen width:1024 by 600 pixels resolution
and the major issue with this tablet is the screen quality
the viewing angles are no good from several angles
I change these settings just to give you an idea
it is not at all good but you can improve it a little bit
and now let's check out the camera and yes it is working
you can check the sample images on my website
you can use this tablet in portrait as well as landscape mode
application and let me tap on tally 9
I'm running this exe file from an external drive
I am now going to use the HDMI cable
that came free with this tablet going to attach the mini
the tablet screen will be mirrored on this screen as you can see
GB pen drive and I'm going to connect this mouse
it's much simpler faster and easier using a mouse now
and as you can see it is set to duplicate the display
I'm going to change the multiple display option to show only on two
I have connected the wireless mouse as well as the USB pendrive
I'm going to try installing the nova bench
3 benchmark application and while installing it requires the net framework ok
I am going to install that too as already mentioned
I'm going to cancel that because I've got limited storage space
I'm going to try playing the Wolfenstein enemy territory game
the whole package is installed on the external storage
this is the online game and I am already connected to the Wi-Fi network
I will not be able to play this game because I have not connected
the external keyboard there is lag but the game should be playable
the screen quality on the tablet is not that great
but you can always connect an external screen using HDMI cable after one r51
one is as good as a netbook but with limited storage space of 16gb
the doodoo from fusion garages caused quite a stir here at stuff on paper
let's find out so underneath this huge 12.1 inch screen
you can override this sensor to make everything just a little bit brighter
your only option is to pretty much weight
the lack of flash support and working in the cloud is brilliant
there's no way to install client software for the likes of Spotify or Skype
the speakers are horrible though so plugging in your headphones to the 3.5 millimeter
but perhaps this could all be saved by a future firmware update
and this is the HTC Flyer 7-inch Android tablet
white maybe here with these rubber end caps and here
we've got your volume controls power button up top here headphone jack
this does not have a user replaceable battery
Buy you have to buy it separately for I believe
$80 this is an active digitizer pen that means it has a battery inside
you can see the best by co-branding on here
and we'll show you that later so the flyer is a 7-inch Android tablet
and that's what this hasn't signed but still very impressive
so you can see the three of them together
HTC looks you know like an HTC phone kind
I guess you could say obviously science wise
it's very easy for your fingers in your eyes
I inflict clock with the weather over here
you see the 3d effect as you go through here on the camera
I'm not sure it's the easiest thing to control of it
if you don't actually want to unlock the device
you just wanna quickly go to calorie just drag
its and lock ring pretty cool so on the bottom here we have
of course capacitive touch buttons for your home
your menu button your back and this is for the pen
I will show you that in a minute
if you touch that it brings up the two pen
and we're gonna discard this one and notice
you can actually throw photos on their web pages
and we've actually created a couple of notes the user interface is largely self-explanatory
I get to my list of all notes
Corel Painter or one of the other painting applications like our traits
you can use an ink a highlighter paint
we want to go back and you know sweep you with color
so that's the notes application and again this does sync with
and we're going to take a look at Jane
here gives you a bunch of public domain books for free
and you've got the cute page-turner animations and it looks like it
Kobo books and again you can choose your font size
we do not have an account on this store
you can say we have a choice of 15 movies 15
this can play 480 and 720p video 1080p video
it's looking very nice the 1.5 gigahertz processor and
we're going to take a look at HDMI output
but it's not bad looking either so that's HDMI output
it's gonna be $4.99 at Best Buy Wi-Fi only available May 22nd
the only the only thing that holds us back from hardly recommending
this is the fact that it doesn't run
HTC thought that they could do some value added by throwing
they're a very popular sense on a tablet
but just keep in mind that it's probably going to be into the road
and just about everything else you want to know about this tablet
Let’s take a look at the Gaomon PD1560 screen drawing tablet.
The tablet worked great in all five programs
None of the other programs had this issue.
If you’re having these problems the solutions are in this review.
The PD1560 costs less than similar tablets from other companies.
You can leave it on or take it off.
Then I put the screen protector back on.
The bottom of the holder is a pen tip remover.
You get both so you can choose which kind you like.
This is actually really cool, and I wasn’t expecting it.
I don’t feel worried at all about using the case.
You can’t tell from the video, but this tablet is lightweight.
It’s the most portable screen tablet I’ve used.
Take your folded up stand and turn it so
the long bar goes toward the top of the label.
Insert the bottom two screws into the holes.
place the stand on the tablet as is.
You’ll feel the screws line up with the holes.
You can wiggle the stand a bit to make sure they get in there.
Screw in the top screws, then the bottom screws.
Done! The stand adjusts by pulling the lever at the back.
Even this far up it’s pretty stable though.
and plug the end with two pieces into the side of the tablet.
Take the three piece part and plug the power cable into the round end.
Press the power button on the side of the tablet
you have and unzip and install the driver.
Press the Auto button until the menu is gone.
The tablet software doesn’t start up automatically, so you need to to right
click the tablet icon and Run As Administrator.
Do this a second time to get into the controls.
Under Press Keys you can set the shortcuts for your ten buttons.
you can change how sensitive your pen is.
You may program the two buttons on your pen on this screen as well.
on your main monitor, right click, Display Settings.
Notice how the settings are upscaled to 150%.
Use the dropdown at the top to select your tablet monitor.
If you are left handed, check this 180 radio button.
Take your pen and press the red dots on the screen.
Press the Menu button to enter an option.
Press the Auto button to go back one step.
The PD1560 has a lot of options, which is nice.
when you turn the tablet, versus a high quality monitor there’s not much change.
The tablet screen needs to be facing you for true color.
I’ve personally tried that I recommend you look into is the Huion Kamvas GT-191.

so ye let's do dias okay so he
and yeah this is gonna be a fun little video so let's get started
so this tablet you can use it for signing online documents
I couldn't wait as soon as I got in the mail
thank you for choosing this little little lion thing
okay so this is like a oh this is a clicker
I know I know what these buttons do
I guess I have to figure out what this is
I had to charge it and I'm guessing with this one
good guy this is like a bag of like little nips
I don't know what this metal ring is for
the cord is really short as you can see
okay so here is the actual tablet itself so tiny and so cute
let's just enjoy this speedpaint featuring some miku fan art that I actually drew
the unboxing of the package was really nice and it looked perfect
I was fairly surprised that throughout the entire time drawing
I'm not really into that kind of lifestyle now
but not really enough for me to really get flustered and angry about
it's not really that big of a deal that's just me being whiny
I'm trying not to repeat myself because I really do
I've already talked about why I loved it
I just it's it's just been such a long time
since a small tablet it was has such a good quality
so if you're if you're starting out in art and you're buying this tablet
I wish I had this whenever I first started out
we're not talking about my poor decisions around pets
I really like this tablet and I really wish I got
now you know what this toilet is capable of that
I really like this tablet so I'm just gonna stop rambling
that has a few extra bells and whistles.
that are often double the price, sometimes pushing into the thousands.
The pen itself comes with a nice little stand, and requires no batteries.
Within the software, you can set these globally or on a program-to-program basis.
if you’ve set up some custom commands that would otherwise be unusable.
Thanks for listening, and I will see you next time.
hello this is a very quick look at the
this actually turns the tablet almost into a a little console
I hope you found this short review so thanks for watching
Wacom Hey well I come for the Wii
the system itself is well designed and quite sturdy
the tip of the stylus acts as a button itself
and there's a long one to the side
oh you're got the wheel come down like that
it's small and can tuck away very nicely
there's the tutorial area with several bits of information on basic controls
then there's the different sections that you will be using more than others paint
there's the gallery area where all of your saved artwork is kept
nobody can finish a piece of artwork on this thing in 30 minute
they mean 30 minutes of actual drawing okay
I see see every time you make a line
it counts towards your 30 minutes fractions of seconds
there isn't a lot of tutorial on how to actually use the system
it gives an explanation of tools in the manual
but there's no practical application that walks you through it
I made quite a few mistakes until I learned how to shade correctly
then teaching them how to use it is real essential
if you want to use that bit of a program
is that it's not made from left-handed people
it's not a professional tool by any stretch of the imagination
it's a nice game and a nice peripheral
I don't see much happening with the upcoming games like pictionary
who know nothing of the you draw program of the positives
there's a 30-minute time limit for your artwork
there's no tutorial on how to use some of the more interesting devices
the target audience here is going to be kids and artists sports fanatics
I just want to say I think this is a great idea
but there's so much more room for expansion
Nintendo y-component n-no I think I will draw it Chuck
it's gonna make you gawk now that doesn't work
the kneepad 3 is the latest tablet from the Chinese company
it has good contrast and viewing angles the only concern
the smartphone in my pocket measures in at 6 point 2 inches
the software is very appealing out of the box
Android 7 new --get which is a must for an Android tablet
multitasking is not available with this version of me
UI I read a report that said 'my UI 9.0
it's just such a tease but what that said there are some other features
it's reminiscent of a full-fledged laptop or a desktop
the biggest con is the lack of roms got support
I found it to reform on par with the front facing sensors
found in many flagships out there under the hood
that should provide an average around 8 hours of screen on time
Android tablet with a good screen and amazing build quality
if you are at all interested links will be down below as always
so let's get this disclaimer out of the way right now
acer is not paying me to make the video
I personally own the Acer Tab 8 tablet
I happen to be a big fan of tablets especially large tablets
you want to stay fit for the ladies
you is so not one of the things
I love about a tablet including the Acer
let's take it whether you throw in the car and off you go
so we have a 10.1 inch 1280 by 800
IPS display on here LED and which makes it HD
it's not 1080p but still is quite good for watching movies
reproduction is really awesome on their comes with
easy setup easy wakeup easy gadget easy tracking on there as well as you
I think this is a good value for the money it comes from
Acer Acer is a well-known reputable company not an unknown from some company
you never heard of number two it comes with a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core CPU
but it's still very very good for doing everything we talked about in
gigs of flash storage and a micro SD card slot
eight five megapixel rear camera and a two megapixel front-facing camera
I don't think you're going to go wrong with this tablet
I'm going to show you this wireless tablet that is made by weon
they sent me this unit for review purposes
so let's take a look at the tablet itself
this is the packaging box by the way
the working area of the tablet is actually thirteen
there are four extra nibs and there's this nib remover
in addition to all this stuff it also comes with some cables
this is a wireless pan that is powered by a battery inside
you just need to plug it in and use it at the same time
the other cable that is provided is the charging cable for the tablet
this is a wireless tablet and this is also powered by battery
let's take a closer look at that tablet on the top left
we have the power switch and below that our signal lights
there's one signal light for the wireless connection so once you turn it on
this will turn blue the top line here
Wacom tablet this way on tablet is almost 2 times the size of this
Wacom tablet and this is a medium sized Wacom tablet
I can install the drivers from this time drivers
alright let's talk about using the tablet on their
let me show you how to do that
and in this panel you can see the twelve buttons here
you can turn them off as well using these two buttons here
if you are left-handed you can check this button here
that's all there is to customizing the pen and tablet
I'm barely putting the nib on their surface of the tablet
Mac os10 I find a drawing experience to be flawless
this is a tablet and it comes with its own stylus after
I find that the pressure sensitivity on the Microsoft Surface pen stopped working
I recommend you install this software called lazy Nezumi Pro
let me close this fall and open a new file so now
I've switched on lazy Nezumi Pro to draw the same thing again
I stopped and the second line and the third line and let me move
then you don't have to buy this because other applications
drawing performance with this tablet is very smooth
there is almost no lack and pressure sensitivity works very well
the only downside to this tablet is the driver compatibility with Photoshop
cs5 cs6 on windows 7 and 10 all of them
I don't have any problems with Mac OS overall
I will say this is a very good tablet
and it's very convenient because it's wireless so yeah it's a good tablet
so you can go and download them and try them
multi-touch display running at 1280 by 800 resolution making it also the highest resolution

there's a sensor for a dock connector over here
this is your charging hole right here and that's the microphone
it's not going to pick up fingerprints well as you can see
looks nice and feels nice other than the fingerprint nation
this part is plastic up here because there are antennas underneath and then
you have dual speakers here at stereo speakers
they can shoot 720p video quite good video in fact dual LED flash
and you'll have to send that back to
it's quite a thin device or a tablet feels nice
feels like it's all about over here for a size comparison
you might be able to fit the Galaxy
Taman now here we have it next to the iPad
you can see they're about the same length
iPad is wider though and in terms of weight
they're about the same at each one point
just fine and you can set it up
that said the on-screen keyboard is so good
hopefully it will be soon via a software
update that's a bit weird it's running android
this is the new honeycomb interface right here
this does not make phone calls however over the cellular network
we've got a million heavyweight applications running in the background
you can choose widgets app shortcuts wallpapers and others stuffing
minimize this is your home button to bring you back to the home screen
we have a lot of apps actually running right now
I got my tweet caster running and telling me other
some applications installed the music player running in the background
I can just tap on that to start it again
we have just your time wi-fi's battery status
you get more stuffing switch to airplane mode
you can look for system updates there you can see is running
Android 3 you go back home again now
Motorola verizon really haven't loaded this with any applications in them
many of these are actually my own that
I put on here you do get of course Google Marketplace Google Books
the web kit base web browsers are really awesome
you're playing find out what the movies are
we're gonna take a look at the YouTube player which is pretty awesome
TVs look here for all sorts of videos also very responsive pick something
you've got fancy pagesturning animations just like apples
the brightness set the day/night theme text size line height oddly
this can make a very nice ebook reader
that's one thing for those of you prefer ink
we've got our own website going right here
which as you all know is very heavy
and let's take a look at another page
so it's gonna play right in a YouTube player New York
Times front page videos tend to not be very high quality though so
I'm not sure you expect much from this
and obviously this is bigger than most portable navigation
the movie the project and drop more movies in here to join them together
we'll show it to you very large birds under ten display so yes
Angry Birds good news is here obviously runs perfectly in fills the screen next
I'm going to take a look the 3d game Dungeon Defenders
this really makes use of the Nvidia graphics and dual-core processor
I think it will look at one more third-party application here movies is Flixster
it's not quite the look that you're used to
it's it's much better in fact so you see right here
these scroll independently if you want to search you
don't here and here you can see the keyboard then
I can actually type two-handed as if I were touch typing very nice
our we're going to show you that by using the Atrix ism HDMI cable
the one actually that came with the Atrix for some reason
we have our Android desktop looking mighty fine on a very large screen TV
you give us review and i was like give me
gaomon sent me their 15.6 inch drawing monitor in exchange for a review
also if you're interested in buying the tablet i will leave a link below
i believe wednesday so it's been sitting in our garage for a few days
i don't think we need any of these boxes now
so here's the box and they have this nice little illustration on the front
wow i don't know it's like you feel that
actually let me open up this case this
oh and it also has the gaomon logo
i'm just gonna move this traveling case away so we can look at
obviously right here we have the actual drawing tablet
yeah wow this is really big and it's probably really nice drawn
so let's see if i can open this up
okay let's pull the drawing tablet um they have this dial wheel
um all right so obviously here we got the stylus or the tablet
um let's open it up and see how it looks and feels too
so wow okay that i actually really like how this the stylus feels
i'm gonna pretend i know what that means
this mainly happens when i'm using a really big brush on fire alpaca
and i looked at how much they are
i explained this and they were like it's fine river
we like your style and we just want an honest candid review
it's not going to fall apart at any moment
you know budget's good but i don't want you know completely not to trash
um a little bit grubby there on the side
it's got that center home button in the middle
lots of people saying they resolved the issue with little bluetooth speakers
but i have to say it doesn't bug me
sometimes that must be weird but uh it's fine the swiping and scrolling as
obviously my ipad feels a bit more luxe
i've actually ended up preferring the feel of this
the edges aren't too curved and too rounded
it's decent quality for low end specs and a very low price
so now i'm going to run off the specs for all of you
so you can connect it to a monitor for direct video output
maybe not that last one but you know it does a lot
it also features a 5v2a micro usb power adapter now
i charge it that night and it wouldn't turn on again
so far we've had no problems with the replacement amazon
i use it all day and it worked very well
i used it heavily ever since i received it
it should be priced less than what the purchase price was
i did buy a case and screen protector and immediately use them
i could find no setting to resolve the issues
with color and clarity speakers leave a lot to be desired
so she said it should be priced less but that was in april 2019
didn't hear from them ended up contacting amazon support
they wanted to send a replacement tablet but he had already been refunded
finally i'll add that my contact with dragon touch customer support
jack q chan this time around was exceptional
so i bought it for my two-year-old's daughter
two-year-old guys don't buy tablets for two-year-olds give them a book
she doesn't write very well because she doesn't read many books
i ordered this just before it was released
just fine attached a screenshot of a third-party device hardware info app
the sound from the speakers is very good for this price range
so what were my final thoughts about the dragon touch k10 notepad
it doesn't move with great speed and agility but for 99 dollars
it's you know what it's like guys a few years ago
you need to be constantly gaming you know
so let's not pretend that it's going to work for you
no problem i'm just jumping in here to mention that
i do all of that on my phone so for me
i'm not doing that but we're all different
i am not a professional at this field whatsoever
media bang paint is not an animation program
of course you gotta add your audio in this video
stauber canvas size that i use is 1920 by 1080 pixels
it's completely up to you if you want to
i'll probably upload the whole thing soon once i finish it okay
time for the tablet review xp pen deco mini 7 wireless
honestly what i like about this tablet is it's very portable
so uh using this tablet for a while
but if you're from the philippines you can follow at experiment page
I'm gonna supply some links to old Satori graphics videos that are based around
Wacom tablets as well as give you guys the rundown on
and you're even going to see a few scuffs on my
one tablet is one of the most basic models of any
tablet is ideal because it bridges the gap between developing logo designs on paper
and then we're finding them digitally in the daily straighter
it's also really handy for digital hand lettering
however if you're like me and use a laptop a new
I found that when I draw with the Wacom splash one table
she's had it for a while and she really loves it so yeah
all right and pen goes like that eat
I found in an old sketchbook I was flipping through a little while ago
maybe enhance the color and shadow of these cords
I'm just trying to put them on a blank page at this point
Photoshop like there are five different ways to do this
I'm sure and probably all of them are easier than what I'm doing
I had to start over again because Photoshop just completely froze on me
I think that was part of the problem
I just had some some wonky computer issues and stuff
I think it has eight thousand something different pressure points
I'm gonna be doing this unboxing today of this
so that's a very promising item that I look for because screen
let's see it has a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core Atom processor
so we're gonna see how that works out
so you can actually dock this tablet you can see
this is important because if you used some of these
why getting the task manager up and showing you folks its performance figures
this is in fact an intel atom z3580 gigahertz
so when you get the system do expect to have
it needs to space so don't put too many applications on
it supports up to 32 gigabyte s microSD card however
it was really fast and that will definitely be your best option
if you're going to be looking at expandable storage for this unit what
I'm gonna do now is load up Google Earth which I downloaded last night
I don't have any problems with too much lag here
I noticed by typing on this last night
I'm currently at 27% battery life and it's showing about of hours 16 minutes
I don't really know exactly what the total battery life is gonna be like
it is a little bit slower than you know
it doesn't excel very well in web browsing per se because generally if when
I like to get a tablet with good web browsing capabilities
I like to have that paired with good battery life
it's definitely worth the 56 dollars for my purposes at least because like
and how does that compare to this unit
I hope you'll find this review to be informative for you
let's get into the unboxing when you open the box
you're fated with a big beautiful tablet monitor covered neatly in a protective sheet
I bought it from Amazon so I have plugs from everywhere
and here's the stand wrapped all snug in a thin foam sheet
it also came with an extra pen as a gift
Here I am forcing my boyfriend to do everything for me
it's like magnetized so you can set it to like different heights
here's some saying that it's a nice sleek material and it's also very sturdy
so drawing on this tablet was pretty nice
Photoshop and I didn't have any problems with the driver
this tablet works as a second monitor instead of like a like tablet
the pen is actually really light and nice
being a second monitor it is not a touchscreen
it only works with the pen stylus so just keep that in mind
that's that is touch for your finger that Scrolls and zooms is very choppy
it looks really beautiful and bright and vivid
it feels really really natural drawing on it also one thing
quality is really nice like the physical quality
I recommend this tablet to anybody who is wanting a cheaper screen tablet
although you're sacrificing the fact that it isn't a touchscreen
it's really comfortable and it's definitely a nice start one thing
I have to kind of put a book behind it
I'd like to throw in is that I really do wish that
I'm going to leave the Amazon and liuyan link in the description
thank you all for watching and I'll see you in the next video bye
