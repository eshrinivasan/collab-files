so that you don't get a lot of blue light out of it does have an octa-core chip running android 10 and a 5 000 milliamp hour battery and on the back
it's running android 10
uh which is nice
that's great to have that built in and you have a magazine with your manual with a couple different languages in there and color pictures and how to operate the tablet if you're familiar with android this is a pretty straightforward device
and so if you're going to use this like to travel with or if you're going to use it on the couch between family members this is something that you get a lot of good viewing angles from and really easy to use and nice comfortable size to hold
it actually has some cool features to the body too it has this gnarling here on the the sides and so that kind of makes it a little bit easier to hold on to which actually feels really good with your fingers too
as an example
we'll wait till the ad is over and then we'll skip it and you can see what it's like to view videos on here so if we skip the ad and then go full screen again you can kind of see viewing angles auto rotate all right
we'll go back here
it's just a
there we go now
that's fully loaded
it feels like a really good way for either your kids or your family to enjoy android on something that has a great battery life with a good screen decent stereo sound
and it's an easy to use device and so if we flip around to the other oops if we flip around to the other camera we can come here and look at this
it's meant to be something that can have easy access to the web and some applications from google play and to kind of use for quick pictures of stuff you know and i think the price reflects that too and so from a consumer standpoint
i think that this would be a good choice for somebody looking to satisfy those needs with an android tablet that it comes in at a pretty respectable low price so i hope you guys enjoyed this review of the dragon tech 10.1 inch android tablet and check out everything else
how's it going guys
who's still watching my videos anna and today i have a new video for you guys so gaomon the company that produced a drawing tablet and a digital tablet has sent me one of their drawing tablets for me to review and it is one of their new drawing tablet
a pen tablet eight pen nibs nip clip quick guide pen sleeve a free glove a drawstring bag a pen nip sleeve driver installation card otg adapter and there's a warranty card
another thing
you don't need a cable to charge the pen because the pen doesn't need a charge so it is good so let's go with the installation so you just can download the driver from their website and in this case you need a m106k pro if you are in windows
download the windows driver
it is pretty similar with the drawing tablet that i'm using now which is pablo drawing my so it has been a while so i didn't seem to find any issue at all so far so good like the
actually right now and
I'm sure it's very similar as we're in the world I really like some inch tablets and with this review we want to find out if the Galaxy Tab 7.0 is a good competitor in this category
it looks quite similar to all of the tablets even the first Galaxy Tab from 2010 we've got the Samsung logo on the tops in the 7 inch display in this case on underneath the home back and multitasking button
actually because this it does not feel as cheap as you might think s and as some competitors do it's very solid bit and yet really is nice in your hands
it feels quite solid
that is very nice but obviously you can't compare this plastic to an iPad or even the Galaxy Tab as to which feels a lot better but I really expected less for this price especially from Samsung's I'm positively surprised
now choose the 16 by 10 as the ratio again it seems to be the standard now from Samsung since the bigger Galaxy Tab A 10.1 has it as well you have a 7 inch
it's quite bright
is that the internal storage only has a capacity of 8 gigabytes from those 8 gigabytes 4.3 gigabytes are usable which is not a lot and with over 100 euros over hundred
D card
that's more for higher
most apps
want smoothly in here
it went quite smoothly
obviously the graphic does not look as good as on a higher-end gaming tablet but it's really playable and the same goes for Riptide gp2 or even lower and lower end games of course like subway servers so all one smoothly but to be clear
this tablet gets a little over 1,000 points and into - it's around 22,000 points and that's alright for a tablet for this price but it's not really that awesome
this with n-word 5.1.1
lollipop there are a couple of several release over the last two months but there were four bugs and security stuff no marshmallow inside yet if something will ever update it to marshmallow
Tab 7.0
obviously you have the calendar video player and so on but the office apps are missing some touch with features like the integrated clip boards that we see with more expensive tablets that is integrated into the homescreen
I really like the Galaxy Tab a 7.0 a lot more than I expected when I started this review because sometimes a low-end devices from Samsung are not that great but this is actually quite nice
but that's alright
I wish there would be a version with 16 gigabytes so you could install more apps if you want to but if you just want to surf the web and watch YouTube and just install a couple of maybe one or two games
and nj4 tech reporter
TV thanks for watching
we're like three pallets
and they're both okay
I do recommend to download everything that you need and the kit is going to meet before you give it out some tests because it doesn't come on anything nothing
here's the charger
very simple really
to learn about photography we have learning apps where they ditch them that have green and things like that so this is basically the challenge is swipe you down so free time
I was blind
Wi-Fi Boucher good structure
thanks really good
personally it's been a whole lot of animal crossing rewatching the simpsons swallowing in my own misery but also picking up some new skills like drawing which i'm sure many of you watching are into as well and fortunately the kind folks over at gaomon
i don't know a whole lot about drawing tablets as i've only ever owned one other tablet before this one so take everything i say in this video with a grain of salt but it most certainly does its job as a glorified secondary monitor over here so no complaints there
and i never really had much issue accessing all my files even on a mac though i did need to use an adapter for that which was more on apple's side than anything truth be told though that wasn't the case from day one what happened was they sent the tablet in this beautiful box all the way from gaumont land where it roamed free together with all the other gaomon we set it up
so it was unusable
full screen
all to myself what i really dig about this thing personally is how customizable everything is like especially on the side with all the different buttons for brightness and the gaumon menu but also these big ones which are there for any type of shortcut you need
but as i was even able to set it up on my macbook most modern hardware and software and all the major drawing programs like photoshop sketchbook pro or medibang should be able to handle this thing
that also made my life a whole lot easier as you're able to adjust it to your liking as soon as you've screwed it on there yourself kind of wish that was on there from the beginning but what can you do
the pattern also makes up for its quality with these little knob thingies they attach that you can use to switch out the one on your pen in case it starts to scratch the monitor
they sent you which i chose not to because i like to live on the edge once you recharge the pen once you can use it for a good few hundred hours and no worries there
they were alright
the quality of life on this thing is great with this price tag as it only costs a little over 300 bucks which finally gives me an excuse to draw more though not much
you can't go wrong with one of these gaomon things and you can also get like 20 off one if you check my links in the description so for a more affordable solution
hey there
venue cradle duck here
the venue 838 40 is also nice and thin at just eight point nine five millimeters thick and weighing just 0.74 pounds which is ever so slightly heavier and thicker than Google's Nexus 7 for example however
RAM and 16 gigabytes of on-board storage and a 1920 by 1200 Full HD IPS capacitive multi-touch display as well as 802 11 AC compatible Wi-Fi miracast support in Bluetooth 4
let's have a look the backside of the Dell Venue 8 38 40 sports a 5 megapixel camera and a textured sort of ribbed plastic casing that resists fingerprints pretty well and also provides for a firm gripping surface in the hand and with a relatively solid field
it's a well-built tablet
you'll find the 2 megapixel camera and though some of you with smaller hands might tend to disagree turning the display on and off with the power button from the top right edge of the device does work relatively well and it's pretty comfortable finally on bottom you'll find a single speaker
the technology employed
it's a really nice touch an impressive feature to be onboard such a reasonably priced slate of course the cradle itself is optional and sells for $69.99 another optional accessory offers a welcome expansion to the venue 838 40s audio capability and that's Dells wireless bluetooth speaker ad 2011
this also chirps as well when connected and offers 10 hours of untethered audio streaming and an integrated microphone for hands-free conferencing though the venue 838 40 is an Intel powered device Dell set it up with a very standard-issue Android KitKat
there's a quick access toolbar for things like Wi-Fi Bluetooth location services and screen adjustments but other than that dell also skins things very lightly here which quite frankly we like just fine and incidentally on the bottom of display is your traditional flat black row of standard Android controls for home back and menu buttons
the 8-inch display of the venue 838 forty has a native resolution of 1920 by 1200 which as you can see here versus the Google Nexus 7 on the Left offers a larger overall image
but it has the same relative screen real-estate viewing angle capability of the venue 838 40 is actually pretty competitive to the Nexus 7 as well though the Nexus 7 is just a tad brighter overall performance wise this Intel powered Android rivendell tablet holds its own versus the competition
quite well actually
and in many workloads it outpaces devices like Google's Nexus 7 and even Samsung's more premium Galaxy Tab s line again depending on workload with respect to graphics and gaming especially the venue 838 40 is surprisingly strong as you can see here and our 3d mark ice storm results

now this is a 10.1 inch tablet that i have got here and i've been using this for a week or two now and i thought i'd just pass on my personal findings to you and my ratings in case you're interested so without any further delay
and first of all
you don't really need that if you know about tech and uh there's a little card here i can't even get that out and the only other thing that was actually in the box was a little usb charging cable which i've you know i won't even show you that you know that what a cable looks like but you know there's no charging plug there's no case you know you just get the basics you get the tablet and a charging cable and really
that's it now
this tablet here
it's quite a a weighty device and in fact the back is metal and uh you know it's got a metal back so nice and sturdy um doesn't bend or creak it feels good quality and uh it's nicely built now in portrait mode all your buttons and functions are along the top here
yeah that's um that's it on the top and obviously if you have it in you know landscape they're going to be on the side depending on you know how you orientate it so build quality
it's heavy metal back
i bought this tablet because it's got a a 1920 by 1200 resolution screen and i must say it's a nice screen a nice display and it gets quite bright
um so you know you're probably not quite good enough to use in bright sun but one of the brightest displays i've had in the budget tablet market so the screen does check out for me and uh i particularly like the the 1920 by 1200 resolution because on the 10 inch display
uh the the screen definitely checks out with me and i'm gonna give that eight out of ten as well now storage you've got 32 gigabytes built in out of the box but you have got a socket you can expand it with a memory card and uh i'm not quite sure how much you can expand it by but you know it's going to be at least 32 gigs on top of if not more you'll have to look that up but storage
it's it's acceptable
it's acceptable now charging as i said only a micro usb unfortunately you know but so we'll only give it a 4 out of 10 although it does charge quite quickly
it's not particularly snappy
it's fine
i think the processor
and i have to say it's one of the better cameras i've seen on a budget tablet but let's just go into it now and you know the trouble is
i suppose
and there's no option to change that up or you know down same with the video if you if you go into video here uh you know you go into the video there we go video
it's the same
hey i've just taken that indoors but you know you can see you can zoom in very poor light in here it's usable be fine for all your zooms and skypes and you know putting cat filters on you and all the rest of it
milliamp battery is fast
six at tops
so i think that checks out for me and i'm going to give the battery as uh i don't know six out of ten um final four and i want to make mention
it's okay you know it's okay but you know you're not i don't think you may get android 10 on here um so in a nutshell you can pick this up on the internet on you
they've gone up in price a bit because of you know a lot of demand from all the kids and everything uh with the schools shut and all the rest of it but you know just over 100 quid
it does a job
you know i'd seven out of ten from friendly horse and uh i'll wrap this one up there because i've got lots more to do and uh i just like to end the video by saying thank you very much and i hope you uh are interested in this tablet or not
bye for now
it's great for drawing
I think now I'm not 100% sure I'll double check but I think they have a year warranty on this and instructions on how to install the software and a little thank-you note
it's without a battery
the actual tablet instruction manual yep and a USB C and a micro USB adapter in case you want to connect it to your phone a bunch of tips nibs anything
um it's a little on the thicker side as far as these things go but I've been using it and my wife's been using it and I mean honestly it does not affect it's actually easy and convenient to use so all right
and if you've seen some of the other ones on here it's like four by three and I mean it sounds like a decent size but that's basically the size of your phone even smaller so you get like this much drawing area versus this then it's got pressure levels in the pen so basically the tip has a sensor
and that's basically the tablet sends a report to your computer of the Pens location and it's basically reports per second the RPS and this has 266 RPS which is really good once again
where exactly it's located so basically it comes down to how accurately it can determine the tips location on the board so just how accurately you can draw so basically when it comes down to it it's the RPS and the LPI is what determines how good a tablet is because it's how many reports get sent to the computer about where your pen is moving and then how precise the report is the only thing
I'm gonna mention that if you have a like lower-end computer it can sort of slow down the response rate because it sends way too much information and the computer with a lower quality would not be able to keep up but honestly that's on the very low-end computers and if you're doing graphics stuff your computer should be able to handle it
okay so um you can it follows it even when you hover and then pretty precisely okay so now we will try to draw like a thin thin line okay
I clicked something there
see you next time
that if you're looking to get a tablet like this but you don't really have a really big budget then you might want to have a look at other brands than the most established ones because the most established brands always have a massive marketing budget behind them
I'm so excited about this review because the more companies that come out with tablets like this in this price point and that does this these kind of similar things the more competition the more innovation and the less the the prices go down because because of the competition so the more brands that are out there creating these kind of products the better it is for you and me as a consumer so in this video
I'm gonna talk about the specifications and the facts and figures but that's not what this video is really about it's about can it get the job done of what I do in my channel
it doesn't feel like it's going to break and it's well put together with rubberized surfaces on all areas that is in contact with the desk and the tablet for better traction and less slide the stand can only be set to one angle which may be an issue for some but the good news for me is that this is the same angle
it's cylindrical which means it will probably roll away from you and not towards you if you lay it down instead of having it standing up the cap for the case functions as a stand for the pen while the opposite side holds the eight additional
that's all you're going to need to run the display if you need more power there's a wall power plug included with adapters to suit any region of the world
it's pretty interesting now
I feel like I have to give you the facts and figures of the tablet before we go into the fun stuff so I'm just gonna read it off here and see what we have
and not sure what that means but down you know and the display resolution is 1920 by 1080 pixel standard stuff and the input device is USB now with that out of the way let's have some fun and let's turn this Ferrari four five eight main engine into a Ferrari four five eight front engine now
the install of the tablet took about 5 minutes in total just connected power cable from the display into a USB slot in the back of the iMac and connect the HDMI to the mini DisplayPort adapter
well you do have two buttons on the side of the tablet next to the power cord and those are to adjust the brightness of the screen starting out it feels pretty good and smooth and no lag or delay and the pressure works
and that's where
and more however
you have the scroll wheel in the middle which I would use to zoom in and out with my index finger and then you have my thumb on the button right below the wheel as undo
first impressions are good
sensitivity is on point
pro what can
because my experience with testing all of these tablets is that the benchmark is so high that you barely notice any difference but the twice that the price difference can be such a big difference between a well-known brand and then or lesser-known
I think it's $399
I'm the sketch monkey

monkey take care
hi everyone so today i will be reviewing this gaomon s620 a very compact uh writing tablet or writing pad for you to use not only with your laptop or computer but also with your mobile phone so this is how the garmin s620 box looks like
and you know looks pretty uh decent and this is the back part where you can see the details of the company and all that so uh in case you don't know gaomon website it says about income on.net
you can send in the warranty so in the box you will have the tablet itself the writing tablet right very compact size as you can see in this video
there's a usb cable you have adapter for your phone micro usb and type c you have a pen pouch which is quite decent the pan itself the pen tips to change
and then you have a glove for you to use and of course the destruction card so now as you can try on this uh writing tablet you will feel like it's pretty smooth right and i pretty like the surface as well with a pen
if you wear the glove it actually helps you from stopping the multi-touch just in case your hand is a bit wet or you know electrostatic and all that yeah pretty cool so you once you got it you go to garmin.net download and find s620 to download your driver or the software right so just get the latest one
then you will get the the interface like this you can change the smoothness and everything you can also program the buttons on the uh tab itself you can you know you can set to according to your preference
i can scribble
and it's quite smooth real time as well no delay in in terms of what i write on the tablet and also what appears on screen now is pretty smooth and seamless
let's try it out
if you are using zoom this is also a pretty handy you can use the zoom white board and start scribbling as well the same thing in mobile version just in mobile version you can use it only on android 6.0
mac os meaning
as you can see here i can draw whatever i want and for the show you use the brush right according to the uh the thickness of the the brush and all that so you can you can draw
the only thing is because it's um it's a bit smaller than the screen size so you might want to adjust in in terms of the way you position yourself on the writing pad or the writing tablet because it's a bit smaller and compact in size which is pretty decent to bring around if you're using your mobile phone to teach online you know from time to time
so that's photoshop
you can check out
so it's quite affordable and if you're looking for a choice or writing tablet for your online teaching using your laptop or even mobile phone i think this is one a good alternative so you might want to try it out because i really like the grip of the pen as well because it's really comfortable to write and the smoothness of the writing on this tablet or writing pad so go ahead and try it out
thank you very much
so this tablet is the Big Brother to the pen display that I reviewed last year that was the GT 190 this is the GT 220 and this thing is it's pretty fantastic so let's go ahead and talk about some of the specs primarily this is called the 220 so you might think it's 22 inches and it is overall but the display itself is 21.5
so that's a good thing and it has full 1920 by 1080 resolution which is very good now the other thing you might be wondering is what about the viewing angle that is often a problem for graphics tablets or even televisions in some cases this does have an IPS display
I mean it's got a pretty good pretty good color range and then it's the contrast ratio is one thousand to one so that's good and then we also have a little bit of a low brightness unfortunately the brightness is only 250 so pretty pretty dim
it's not a problem
it just has four tabs of sticky on the corners and it's got like a paper feel to it so a lot of people leave it on that's what I'm doing for now
protector in the hub
but that's about it
so that means when you're putting marks down on the on whatever it is you're doing weather sculpting or painting or whatever you're not going to notice a delay not at all for TV to have low response time for video games you want it around 20 because most TVs can't go that low so 5 milliseconds is really really good so I'm very happy with that
now it does come with an HDMI cable and a VGA cable however if you need to use DVI which I think most people probably aren't at this point but if you do need that you're going to get that separately but the fact that it comes with HDMI very very nice happy about that
is that the
and if you stand it straight up it's not going to be an issue at all so it's totally up to you but I did mention so we can move on to this now it does use USB so you have to plug it in to your computer via USB you get that cable also so you plug it in via that and then whatever like HDMI or VGA and then the power cord so you have three cords coming out of the back
so there's like four screw holes in the back and it has gives you the four screws that you need and it even comes with a screw driver in case you don't have one so you can mount it up no problem
it takes like 2 minutes very very easy and then it has a ratcheting mechanism with a lever so that you can adjust the height of the unit the angle and it works very nicely
it's got very small increments between the catches so you can pretty much adjust it however you want and having that lever at the top makes it really really easy to adjust on the fly
I like it
I haven't used them so I can't say for sure but this one as far as I can tell looks to be the best and the bottom of the unit does have a large rubber stopper on it so that it can rest on the table gently right there and then the displaced and has also rubber feet going all the way along the back
so and it's a fairly wide unit being a 21.5 inch display so if you go to the edges of the screen and push you can do get a little bit of wobbling
I'm doing my sculpting and I'm going around ZBrush and I'm pressing on things and clicking on things I don't notice it at all so it's not most likely going to be an issue
hinged or what angle you have it set at but it's not like it's going to fall over or anything like that it just might flex a little bit depending on how you have it so
I don't use them
this doesn't have it
it's pretty pretty awesome
it's just a little
which is very nice
now the one thing
as you're making a stroke and you lift your hand off the stroke sometimes in some software it will kind of do a step instead of just being a nice feathering off into nothing this type of stroke
maybe that's how
I'm using it
I've never worn down a nib especially on display tablets so I don't know I guess some but somebody who does it professionally all the time could but you have eight and a polar to replace the nibs if you need to so that's convenient and you have a little pen holder thingy that you can set the Pens on and that's where you keep the nibs
you do get a an artist glove which is convenient because if you didn't you have to buy one because on a display tablet unless you keep the screen protector on and don't mind getting skin grease on that which
so that's it
I haven't used any other brands but I've looked at them especially the more expensive brands the leading brand for instance is the Wacom Cintiq which is at this size more than double the price
so there you go the other thing to mention is that if you're not interested in a pen display tablet or you have to actually work on the screen you're looking at if you like the kind of situation where you're just using a tablet on the desk and looking at your own display
boo-yan does have a new product coming out called the Q 11k which is a wireless tablet and it's a larger format so it's got some pretty good size to it and again it's wireless so you're not going to be encumbered by any cables and it does have some
it's just their website link so click on it and check it out but if you're interested a really really great price for a product like that so go ahead and check it out so thanks for watching guys make sure you subscribe to the channel
we talk about all kinds of different things sometimes even electronics but usually action figures or movies or TV shows or video games or all kinds of fun stuff like that so make sure you click that subscribe button
teeth lady go yeah
she was next up
thank you next
I'm not your ex
I ain't even planted
hit it twice then
EMB rock-type neck
then don't quit
I'm a toothpick money
man no me
Oh I breathe
hi everyone
I'll show you
what would you get
a pen nib remover
HDMI or VGA if your PC doesn't have an HDMI input the power one and the USB as I've said before the matte screen doesn't reflect much light and this one also shows really nice colors
let's proceed with installation
I did
I did it
and if you go for a lot more you'll only be able to work at a concrete place fifteen point six inches is very nice and portable 19, 21 and more those allow you to have better view of your canvas and that feels so satisfactory and makes you draw faster without the continuous zoom in zoom out
I did this
how colors stay
that's all
because it has amazing metal and build quality rear camera with 8 megapixel and a flashlight and at the front it also has a 5 megapixel front camera as well on the right side
he has a charging port which is a usb type-c charging port and he also takes a micro sd memory card so you can expand it up to 128 gig at the bottom
now this tablet stands out in all different directions first of all for those who are looking to buy one of this for gaming or to buy this tablet for the child to play games
i do recommend it
because this is a tablet that wouldn't slow down wouldn't lag wouldn't freeze wouldn't overheat and when it comes to battery life it has impressive 6000mah battery capacity that gives you up to 10 hours of battery life when it comes to constant use when it comes to constant gaming
that's still brilliant
quicker than a micro usb charging um port so usb type-c can charge a lot quicker and that's something that's quite good as well also it has a built-in three gig ram and 64 gig um internal memory so you can download as many apps you you would like and if you want to expand it you got 128 gig there as well bear in mind that this doesn't come with no um case or no screen protector
but it comes with a cable that you can charge it and the mains plug here as well and it also comes with a built-in um 2.5 d glass touchscreen
the touchscreen is brilliant
it's very touch sensitive and the brightness is brilliant okay the brightness is excellent that's on max brightness and one thing i like about this tablet is that it has their read mode for those who love um reading kindle or for example reading any kind of news um on when you go online this is a brilliant tablet for that okay so for those who love reading um reading
so now if you connect this to a speaker or bluetooth headphones you won't lose that connection you will have a stable connection between that it also has a built-in android 9.0
it has the latest um near to the latest software so we can download majority of the apps and 10 inch screen has also a big screen to for all kind of usage from gaming to you know just shopping online reading books and the immersive reading on white screen with read mode is brilliant especially at night time so it doesn't affect your eyes and it also has features like face
it'll use up
it doesn't lag perfect for gaming perfect for reading perfect for uh web surfing and it's just a generally a decent tablet for that price range and when you purchase it one thing that you would really like and love about this is the build quality and how slim it is
the only downside is that it doesn't come with no case and no screen protector and if you go on ebay or amazon you won't really find any accessories for this because this model is not really that known and for that reason you won't find no accessories for this tablet
so busy being everything
go to speak clearly
I'm really Casona
so stupid okay
okay okay honey
okay so basically that
I cannot leave you
Dallas moves on yet my job my job iPad or any other Android a high-end ski so clean and I think I'll get it sea otter pump limo basically that now it's writing you know freed if you never give me so this one on a cool in able to do it mutiny
hit that function
Gila believe me
Anita Putnam I would end up individually fountain to her so my specs yeah delayed and debris hey guys Allan Poe super review honey feel free to subscribe thing and it comes up appreciate thank you
it basically makes it slim and trim to run on tablets and phones that are really light with specs and this is very light with specs and just to go
there is a microSD slot and then there's a micro USB port to charge it up on this side you have the power button and the volume keys up and down and that is it
it's nothing else on
here is a camera on the back which is 2 megapixel and a camera on the front which is also 2 megapixel but it does not record video it only takes photos so keep that in mind also only one gigabyte of RAM on the tablet and the battery inside is 2500 milliamps
that would be the best according to this but you get about 8 hours of battery life with this but more or less if you were doing videos and stuff it's gonna be much less than that 3 to 4 hours if that now
this tablet is great and the size that it's in for books so if you are a big book reader you're gonna be able to love reading books in this
they're 7 inch tablet
now it's a little bit yellow because it's nighttime and it's just dimming it it's a special feature so it doesn't really look like that in terms of like if you want it to be white you can but basically it just makes a little bit easier on your eyes and like
I said for books
it's fantastic
it's a book
YouTube takes a little bit of time to load up on here but it will play and this is the video playing in 720p looks decent especially for a non HD screen the audio
this tablet is play games and I played a subway surfer and it actually does a pretty good job with it all right here we go subway surfer and I'm not an expert at this game so if I stink that is why
oh oh man
it's not a tablet
Go and I've never personally used the go version of any software for Android but basically I looked it up and says a powerful experience for entry-level smartphones and tablets it's the best of Android built with new and reimagined apps so even the most affordable Android smartphones are sweet as can be and it's you swipe up to see your apps that you have installed you can search for them at the top as well and then Haven even on the home screens
screenshot storage
it's okay
you get the whole
Google Play Store versus you link at the fire store on there and but you also can get the Google Play Store on the fire tablet but you have to install it a lot of people probably don't want to do that expandable storage headphone jack
I'm loading up the Android police website on here and once it gets loaded up though it does a pretty good job of just being able to to look through the website
leave those down below
thanks for watching guys
mio cuore
okay so neo core as I said we've reviewed some of their products on the channel before and they're a British company and today we want to take a look at
so first of all
okay it's worth mentioning
you really see the difference when you're watching things like movies playing games web browsing so yeah 10 inches for the price that you're paying with neo core absolutely fantastic number 2 storage on board you're gonna have 16 gigabytes of storage as standard but it's worth noting that it takes a micro SD card here and that's going to support up to 400 gigabytes now that's huge 400 gigabytes so they've recently done
now support 400 gigabyte
the size of your storage very cheaply whereas obviously with Apple products you have to literally buy the tablet size that you want and if you run out of storage tough luck asset game over so fantastic storage options from the Neo core and one point number three operating system so we have on here 8.1 version of Android Oreo and
a lot of other manufacturers down at the lower price bracket are going to be offering you really low versions of Android but this out the box is snappy with 8.1
I really like it
point number four mini
HDMI absolutely fantastic
feature on all the neo court at its and it is one of my favorite features purely because you don't see it on things like the Amazon Kindle and well that allows you to do is plug in there for the sake of two to three pounds for a cable off of ebay and that's going to let you to plug into a TV or monitor and it just means that if you've got your tablet loaded up with films for the kids and you do want to show it on a bigger screen so that more people can watch it one time you can push it through to the TV
it doesn't use a lot of power so other tablets that I've had you put it to sleep come back in a few days and it's lost 20-30 percent that's not the case with the e1 or the n1 that we've had previously so it's really good in sleep mode doesn't eat the battery and battery
life overall has been absolutely fantastic so 10 hours is another big thumbs up from us and my last point is the fantastic warranty from neo core so as mentioned two year warranty
I don't think you're going to be unhappy with the product but it's just fantastic to have that bit of security with neo core from a British company fantastic long warranty period highly recommend also
you find it
but it's pretty much impossible on a tablet of 10 inches to not have a bubble so the fact that these have come out of the factory with a screen protector on is another huge brilliant plus point for the n1 so to wrap up the review in summary
good storage options
hi this is
just a tablet
not a one that's built into the device so it's not designed to be used as a laptop instead is to be used with your fingers or with a stylus which is slotted here into the device and you can see pulling out that stylus turns it on and opens stylus menu that gives you capture region capture screen create a note and a couple of other options it can be used with a Bluetooth keyboard or a USB keyboard if you really wanted to but it is first and foremost a tablet and while this particular model is designed for the education market
I really wanted to review it because I think it gives us an idea of what to expect from Chrome OS tablets in the future and with that in mind
Quick Settings panel and access for Linux or the ability to run Linux applications out of the box with chrome 67 which is what this ships with as of July 2018 you get access to the Chrome web browser and support for the Google Play Store but if you switch to developer channel you can also run Linux applications so let's take a quick look around the sides here
I'll tell you a little bit about the design it's got a sort of ridged blue plastic back as I mentioned the stylus fits right into the case here on the bottom
we've got a speaker there's stereo speakers one here and one on the other side and a USB type-c port just label information over here micro SD card slot and power and volume buttons second speaker and the headset jack
they're pretty lousy
if you should avoid it the device is sells for about 320 million dollars to education customers you might be able to find them and a couple of retail channels as well but again
ARM based chip four gigs of ram 32 gigabytes of storage and a nine point seven inch 2048 by 1536 pixel display similar to what you would find on the iPad overall
it's not the fastest you're gonna find but if you just wanted to use it for basic web browsing you probably wouldn't necessarily notice that it's significantly slower than any other processor
video playback works nicely
I've used it for
give or take depending on what it is that you're using it for if you install Linux apps and do a lot of multitasking it will probably get less time but I wouldn't necessarily recommend that because the system can get a little bit bogged down if you do too much heavy multitasking
specific another is that
you just don't get to resize and tile and do everything else around your your windows so I can switch between these two by long-pressing and right by a short pressing and then choosing which one or I can drag to the side and tap
I can read an article here and I could say watch a video here and so forth this works not just for browser windows but for all sorts of different applications so if I wanted to open the Google Play Store I could open that and half this if I wanted to open a Washington Post app I could open that in half the screen and I could also resize it to some degree not all apps
reckon support resizing
I noticed I think squid is one that that you can use instead and you can do handwritten notes or typed notes now using the on-screen keyboard here as I mentioned it's sort of an Android style on-screen keyboard one thing that's kind of interesting is that it covers up the bottom so if you're using an Android device you'd still have access to your home back and recents buttons here it covers up all of your navigation buttons so I want to type and I'd have to minimize it if I wanted to switch applications now I can use this to type and I can use gesture typing as well
it's a little bit tricky with this camera angle so typing isn't working or I could switch to input with a pen but this is a little bit weird because you'll notice it doesn't automatically type that in
it's not mostly something
I would recommend doing what I think is more useful is if you wanted to do pictures or actual handwritten notes and there's a couple of neat things that you can do for instance
there's also Google's Auto draw something else that's kind of fun to play with in this case it already had the last thing I drew start over and they draw the same thing again cuz
I haven't spent too much time playing with but you can use this device in a lot of different ways so you can use it for those applications that I just showed you
you just log in on anyone and you have access to all of the the apps and features associated with that account that becomes a little bit less true if you start doing sort of power user things like I did which involves installing Linux and using the terminal application now
that goes into more details about this but essentially one of the reasons that I switch to the developer Channel and I'm running chrome 69 on this device is that I get this more user friendly touch friendly navigation area over here and also that we have access to chrome terminal which is behaving a little bit weird right now so I'm gonna go ahead and close that and try to launch it again
there we go so
I've got LibreOffice
I've got a note
so now you don't expect a lot of education customers to do but it's so you're gonna get a little bit better stability if you if you don't do that a few other things that I wanted to note here is that it does come with a USB type-c adapter but this is more sort of the size of a typical laptop power brick as opposed to more of a smartphone sized thing I think again for the education customers
that's done text
input becomes a lot easier and that comes in handy if you're using things like desktop applications or Linux applications like Libre Office so I can write documents the files
application is a little bit disjointed because the way that Linux runs is actually in a virtual machine so your Linux files are actually saved in a separate area so if you wanted to say download something using Chrome edit it using libreoffice or or another Linux based application you would actually have to copy it first from your say images or downloads folder to the Linux files folder edit it and then maybe copy it back so it's a little bit of a disjointed experience but you sort of get access to three different operating systems in one year you've got Chrome OS with the full-fledged Chrome web browser you've got support for Android applications and you've got support for Linux applications and that makes this a pretty versatile little machine now again for the target market it's a $329 device
so it's pretty attractive in that way even if it's not the highest performance device it's cheaper than a surface go which is Microsoft's new $399 tablet which again doesn't come with a keyboard or a pen at that price range but it's probably going to offer a faster processor and generally stronger performance with a tablet or an operating system that's really designed more for all sorts of devices and not just tablets Chrome OS for tablets
I think the launcher application is one thing that I've noticed that the more apps you install here the more it becomes obvious that the best way to find them is using the search bar because they're not necessarily arranged alphabetically or in order of installation you do have access to the most recently used ones up here at the top but it's a little bit finicky overall
I personally am a very much a keyboard guy and if I wanted a device that I was going to use for actual work I would prefer the ability to resize and move around the windows
I think there's there's a lot of appeal in a device like this that has access to all of Google's tools has a relatively reasonable price tag and and has access to the full Chrome web browser which means that any web-based educational applications that you want to use you can use and of course has pen input which means that you can use it for handwriting for drawing for artistic applications in addition to other things
are you kidding me
i know i know
i'm incredibly picky
i've also owned a huion canvas gt191 because i saw some good reviews about it and i really wanted a screen tablet so i saved it for a whole year and got it and well
this thing was awful
it would just start working about every hour i would have to restart my computer and then restart the driver and even then after doing that multiple times it still wouldn't work the screen protector peeled off after a month so now it was really squeaky to draw on and reflected everything so
this thing just sucked
you should probably just go watch that but yeah i was pretty reluctant to do any sponsorships with tablet companies after this experience then a few months ago artists asked me to review their d16 pro screen tablet and i thought i might as well give it a shot
you got the stand art glove pen a bunch of cables and a nice little pen pouch thing with a bunch of pen nibs in which will probably last me
this tablet's lifetime
the colors on this thing are so nice compared to my normal monitor and i really wasn't expecting that my huion had pretty awful washed out colours so this was a really nice surprise
something you can't do with a graphic tablet or my huion since the stand was attached to the tablet itself so now i can just be lazy and ruin my bird
it's very easy to adjust your drawing onto especially if this is your first tablet and for the price it's surprisingly good after testing out different brushes and different programs
i say almost because the only issue i've come up with is tablet is when using adobe animate or flash this program is very glitchy anyway but with this tablet especially
hi my name's
LiveCode at UK
you set up your profile for your child and then when you put their date of birth in it actually gives you age appropriate apps in that curio genius is where all the parental controls are so you can actually decide which apps they are allowed to look at
I'll try again later
I like about this curio tell connectors they've got lots of games like instantaneous subway surfers and YouTube kids and other crazy games like that what I like about is I can change my avatar and my wallpaper
thanks for watching bye
greetings everyone Eric
now this is gonna be mostly a talking head video so it's not going to be as high production as some of my other ones are and that's kind of on purpose because I feel like this tablet is very interesting to me
so right off
this is the tablet
that box is small
there's the tablet
also up here
you have the pen
oh that's a good
that's a good sound and on the back of it there's a little little click button kind of like how pens are sometimes and that's how you turn it on and off so you don't waste the battery power let's see inside this thing like
then you can listen but inside you'll have kind of your basic stuff so you have the USB which is USB I think it's just micro USB or it might be typing yeah no it's micro USB so the little one you have a bunch of spare nibs which this little pack over here on the this little pack here actually says gift which is funny so you get a bunch of spare nibs and then you have this little baggie full of a bunch of stuff you have a
there's must be a really old model that they're that they released a while ago because it still got a CD which is interesting none of them give you CDs anymore and I would recommend that if you do end up getting this
don't use the CD but I can also see that inside you have like your usual use user manual and your QuickStart guides and stuff like that which is really nice
it's super simple
it's got like very basic stuff which I'm fine with because that makes my life easier but also for what I feel this is I feel like that's more than enough
and so yeah
let me touch it
let me touch me
you usually have this on your desk or on your lap if you're like out and about and you move the pen on here and it shows up on screen over there so you can't you get a little bit of a disconnect between what your hands doing and what you're seeing because you can't directly look at your hand while you're drawing so that's a graphics tablet and this is by far the smallest one
I have ever held
I don't know god I wouldn't even imagine if they could go smaller than this but let me kind of read off some of the specs on the box here so the cool thing is they actually do kind of give you options of what they think this is for so
industrial design nice
I think it's kind of like a beat game like Guitar Hero and stuff like that but you actually have to like click and move to spots to do things
I've been having a lot of like mental health issues and so I've been more stuttery and I lose track of things very easily but yeah this thing is small like it's very tiny but here's the thing it works there's gonna be no footage of me using it because I couldn't get it
I didn't want to install it on this computer because I've already uninstalled reinstalled uninstalled reinstall driver so many times and that's not good for the computer and I don't want to mess this computer up since I have to be doing work on the tablet so I used my laptop which is old and it's a piece of junk so it doesn't record its screen at all but I did sketch on it and I'll throw up a quick little the pencil sketch that I drew and it was not easy for me to do it
because it's so small
so that's something to keep in mind when you're using something like this but um I guess all the jargon out of the way who is this for and that was something I was thinking about do
this would be a good pocket tablet to kind of have with you on the go with your laptop if you needed to do some quick sketches on on the road and you didn't have like a Android or iMac tablet and I think it could also be used as kind of just a quick thing for like
that'd be fine but I think who would really benefit from this actually are kind of the beginners and the younger audiences especially anyone in like kind of the kind of your mid teens and stuff like your like high school students and stuff like that if you're wanting to just kind of test the waters on whether you want to do digital art or not
this is very inexpensive
I know Coppa
I'm not I'm directing this at the parents so parents or basically anyone who's anyone who's over 18 if you know someone who would like to have one of these who's trying to get into digital art and you want to test the waters get them this and see if they if they enjoy the the art itself and enjoy trying it that way
you can get up there like ten in ten by six models and from that actually from huion as well huion next bigger models that are excellent and they're not that expensive so definitely check them out but I'm gonna leave a link in the description here
this is a very weird one and I know this video got a little rambley and it's very unusual to like my other videos because I really didn't show a lot but I feel like this is simple enough that I didn't need to and I think you get the point across very easily by just saying this is for beginners and I feel like it would definitely be worth checking out because of its low cost
I'll probably actually keep this on hand in case I need to do some quick things on the laptop or something like that or if I find like a nephew or like a younger cousin who wants to get into digital art
try it out
see what you like
see if you want to get into this and if you do then you can upgrade down the road to one of Hugh Young's other models which are a little bigger or even they're screen tablets because they do
you can either buy some t-shirts from me on my teespring merch store and if you would like you can go over on patreon and pledge certain amounts and you'll see my patreon pledge amounts my different tiers of things you can get you can get like free artwork and stuff like that and I do want to try to get back into more of that kind of stuff because I've been kind of out of it for a while also follow me on
i'm gonna
i play asphalt 9
uh with about anything
i mean
it's fast you see
isn't that unbelievable
that's really good
that's really nice
music is really good
it sounds really nice
even my netflix
it's just seamless
it runs really smooth
that's fast
i just went up and moved up and i mean just just beautiful video on this stuff and i plan some of my blu-ray streams it runs great on here as well
really happy with it
all right i just wanted to show how cool this uh this tablet is and how how uh it actually can run through the games just like i mean it absolutely runs sweet with games
that's just awesome
you can read ebooks so it is supposed to give a paper-like feeling when you write on the tablet it has a very simplistic design and it has features which are designed to enhance your notebook
so i think i'm the exact target audience for this kind of product and so i've been using it for a couple of months exploring all its features trying to incorporate it into my lifestyle
what i think is also really nice is that you also get a plastic sleeve in which you can put the tablet and you also have a little slot for the pen so all these things look great
the body is made up of aluminium and frosted glass and it weighs just under a pound so it is very lightweight it feels very nice to hold and it feels like a great premium device
it has a very minimalistic design so there is just one button at the top to power the device on and then you just have one port which is the charging port so there aren't any extra buttons the display itself is 10.3 inches and internally you have 8 gb of storage
i've been using it for 3 months and i've used about 0.41 so i think maybe long term it would last now on to the actual feeling of writing with the pen so the pen itself is quite thick and big
it definitely feels a hundred times better than when you're writing on an ipad or for example even on my um samsung phone so when you write with this it's too smooth i don't find it that comfortable whereas with the remarkable two 100 i can write all day and it feels good
experience is quite accurate
and seamless the display of the tablet reminds me a little bit like a kindle but it is even more dumbed down than that because there's absolutely no strain on the eyes no lights coming at you
there is no backlight so you can definitely spend a long time writing on it and it doesn't feel like i'm using an electronic device however one drawback of this because of the lack of backlight is that you have to have an external source of light if you are working in the dark
very simply you have folders notebooks and quick sheets so you can make a folder and in that you can make different notebooks you also have templates so if you want to start a new page you can start a blank page or you can use a bunch of templates which are really really handy
as for the writing tools you have different kinds of pens to choose from then of course you can choose the thickness of the stroke and you just have a bunch of very minimal colors
my handwriting isn't the clearest however i did try it again and i wrote slower and i made sure that my writing was neater and then it actually worked quite well but i think usually when i'm writing my thoughts down
i'm not that neat
so the tablet has a wi-fi connection of course so it uploads everything to the cloud and then you also have the remarkable app which you can access on your laptop and phone so you can password protect your tablet
they really do like it if you look at it on paper the specs and everything it's very limited however when you actually use this device the feeling you get is something that you can't communicate via specs and things like that it has its own feeling
i wish that you could password protect certain files because a lot of people when they're writing their journaling so i definitely want to be able to possibly protect sensitive information like journals and things like that also it would be nice to have autocorrect or the synonyms feature
you don't have to then send it to yourself and try to make it better and finally i wish it had the dictation feature um so i really wish that this had a microphone and you could just speak and it would write things for you and finally something which the samsung notes app actually has is the ability to attach voice recordings to notes
all these features
this is definitely something that there was a gap in the market for being able to replace all your notebooks with just one device and being able to have a great feeling whilst writing it down and having all these little features like undo redo different types of pens to really enhance your writing experience
it's 400 pounds
i think you should buy this tablet if you are the creative type you like writing brainstorming but you want the device to also provide some really nice features which will enhance your notebook experience
it's a normal tablet
it comes with a glove and the tablet itself as you can see it have adapters so you can use it on your phone and finally the pen it comes with two buttons so you can attach shortcuts
it comes with the driver download card and you can contact them in case anything happens nibs with lib remover and start guide and more nibs as you can see
it's a normal tablet
it is cheap
it's about seven and a half inches long five and a half or five point six inches wide and it's about point seven inches in thickness so it's actually slightly wider and thicker than the galaxy samsung galaxy tab and also is a little heavier
this is over a pound like a pound in in an eighth while the samsung galaxy tab is under a pound about point 83 pounds so they see the cruise name
a lot has the power button the AC or DC adapter charger mini USB headphones and an SD card slot it does use a full SD micro on the top here
there is a volume button loud or two plus minus increase the decrease in a reset button as you can also see which may not be too noticeable and isn't disadvantage
it's very basic
that will fix
you can see that
I guess
this is the issue
flash is only supported in android 2.2 and higher unfortunately the processor which is a mips processor is is not really created for designed for for android 2.2 or actually for flash flash requires a cortex a8 processor this processor that the cruise tablet comes with
we believe 1600 megahertz
so it's definitely less than what most smartphone android smartphones are running out and definitely less than what the samsung galaxy tab and even the eee pad which runs at 1.0 gigahertz so again just going looking at the photo rabbit iran again it gets very annoying when you're pressing something that you did not want okay now with skyfire and this is a multi-touch from our understanding it does have pinch to zoom as you can see
we go again
show you pinch if these buttons also very sensitive here and this is what sometimes causes you to unintentionally do something the unit that you don't want to do okay
okay page now
this picture of this video again that's HD 720 just cannot I come up with that we also have problems with certain other videos for the most part of played well but again it's the processor unfortunately is on the power to have the most
i do want to show you this youtube app which we actually have our own app that we install but we have problems with it playing videos so we went to the velocity micro website and they actually had a specific version to use
so you can see in view video so i just want to show you this although you can view videos and we can have problems unfortunately it is again under powered
and that's very disappointing
doesn't it doesn't come with none of the gmail maps so forth so you have to just side load those on your own if you wish to do that does come with a cruise market which is their own app market
actually the cruise market one thing is that it only works with the stock browser when we try using the skyfire it just to do it to a different website so just keep that in
it is very limited
but anyhow this is the cruise tablet for the full review please visit tablet connect blogspot com where we have the detailed reviews including what we have rated this based on our proprietary scoring system for so
that's one thing
I philosopher medical claims that this battery also is a user-replaceable we haven't tried popping this out yet but it is user replaceable which is a plus and so far from our initial usage of this the battery life is is very good
hi everyone i'm nathan with the ebookreader.com for this video i've got the pocketbook ink pad color and the onyx 3 nova colors so they have the same 7.8 inch color eating screen
but as you can see i find it interesting that it actually looks better on the nova screen on the right but we'll get back to that in a second
power buttons up top and then the ink pad it's got the buttons below the screen for paging and menu and home and then it's got the indented screen so it doesn't have that flush layer like the nova and then on the bottom
i loaded up
so i had those cranked up a bit and that was like the reason for the uh completely different color but even when you turn it down you can see here so now it looks like the pocketbook has better colors especially on that lower frame definitely a lot more orange in the background of that so i think it's really interesting that you can actually control this with the onyx device so pocketbook doesn't have any kind of contrast control with their uh reader so if you go too high on the contrast it just makes the image too dark
if you don't want to see parts of the previous page so you can clearly see parts of the previous page on the onyx right now because i just set it to uh like a regular refresh mode instead of the full deep refresh mode
so it's kind of an even playing ground and the uh onyxia text is clearly darker on the onyx but again onyx has a lot more control over this so they have like a couple of different options of the settings
i wouldn't take this as any kind of definitive statement at all but again like with the uh onyx you got android operating system and it's got the uh built-in note app so it's a lot more advanced it's got the wacom touchscreen with pressure sensitive pen that it comes with you got like a full-fledged note app in here with like ai recognition and all this stuff so um it's got a lot more advanced features you may not need that if for a reading device and pocketbook
it doesn't offer this kind of thing right here where you can have a separate note app but i mean you can write on the page like using your finger or if you have like
i mean so
it's a little big difference compared to a wacom touch screen but so again like with the onyx you got all this options with android apps which is a huge deal when it comes to color content because you can easily get connor color content through android apps a little bit harder on the pocketbook you can install a few apps on there they
it's linux based
image viewer app
so there is some options for pocketbook but again with the onyx's android operating system you have google play so you got a lot more uh features with that but i do really like the pocketbooks design with the page buttons and having a memory card
having the contrast control you can control the color a little bit better and definitely a lot faster so you know got a lot more features with it as well so i'm going to go ahead and wrap up this video
that's pretty much it
we got the books
it shows you how you use the tablet and everything you need to know how to connect it um ok so this comes off separately of course you got your DC dock to charge your tablet and you have the your micro USB as you can see here
I got this plastic
that is okay
we got the microphone
does it turns off your tablet automatically for an example if the tablet freezes and the power button is not function you can always press the reset button it will turn off
we also have the email button so if processor takes you to your email specifically Gmail so if you sign then you're good to go and you also got your home screen button so you can just change the home screen the apps and stuff like that you also got settings we got the brightness down option here and the brightness up we also have this button to screenshot the main just to screenshot the tablet
it can only be touched which sometimes it's not very responsive the second thing I noticed is the accuracy of the mouse pointer when I try to select an item
let me start shop
this tablet does fairly well but it cannot be zoomed in with the mouse pad when using YouTube on a web browser it will direct you to the YouTube app so I'm assuming YouTube cannot be played with the web browser itself
it's pretty good actually
I'm playing twenty seven twenty P and one ATP videos this tablet could handle it on one thing it does not do is play YouTube videos from the web browser it will take you back to the YouTube app
I tested out three different types of intense games going from playing Jules with no lag runs this game very good to ten per run to about the same results have no types of lags from the beginning all the way to the end and finally I compared it to modern combat 3
it will heat up
hello internet world
this is the dragon
it's got a 10.1
i'm going to share with you my opinion and as always let's jump straight in to taking a closer look at the product so this is what the product looks like
as you can see it's got an ips screen 10.1 inches 1920 by 1200 resolution the screen so nice high resolution screen inside it's got three gigabytes of ram 32 gig of storage
and that is purely
no sort of bloatware
we're at mid brightness
it's a very responsive screen so it will auto rotate rotate if you have that set in the settings and it's just overall very responsive device i like the quality of the screen
really cool indeed
so that's really nice
let's just pop this brightness down again and it's just a very very nice up let's pop into the settings i just want to drop that brightness down a little bit for the camera
let's pop into the settings and we'll show you what the settings looks like as you can see it's nicely laid out on the settings screen we've got access to network connected devices etc etc if we pop all the way down to system and you can see about and it's the max 10 and we've got three gigabytes of ram it says here it's running google android version 9 and it's also got bluetooth of course installed and it's just a really nice device a very very good value device
but it's a nice quality of plastic as i mentioned you have got these areas where you've got uh for example on this top area here you have got some sort of grip so sort of some grippy areas as well that same down the bottom edge as well
i see screen not necessarily the highest or specific specifications but decent quality screen running google android without spending too much money with google play support and the google services support
of course then

which would be very helpful with your on the move it also comes with an artist glove which I highly recommend using and underneath that is the user manual for Mac and Windows telling you about the setup and how to use a tablet inside the side panel of the box
they also provide a bunch of extra nibs that are stored inside the pen stand along with the USB connection for the tablet and the USB charger for the pen
Express Keys along the side that you can set to customizable options and change them to your own personal preferences but you can have buttons that change because like zooming for undoing processes or for changing the brush size and that sort of thing
they're extremely helpful
it also means that the drivers and the installation software are already inside the tablet for when you plug into the computer for the first time and in terms of the pen
it's also super impressive
because for every two hours of charge time it can last for up to 800 hours and they recommend maybe charging every three months or so so it's extremely helpful and very convenient that you don't charge it very much while testing out this tablet
I decided to work on a little portrait of an elven character and as I've mentioned in previous videos I don't have a huge amount of experience working with digital paintings but it is something I'm very interested in and I did spend quite a lot of hours last year practicing and learning
it's something that
it works absolutely perfectly
I was also checking the levels of pressure and how the how it was registering that and that was also perfect without any issue and overall I had an awesome experience using this tablet and it's something that I will definitely be using again in future and hopefully for more videos in terms of recommendation
thank you to
this is an entry-level
I'll be unboxing the tablet taking a look at what comes in the box testing out the pre-installed Autodesk SketchBook at drawing app and discussing how I found the performance of the tablet not to talk a bit about how I've been using a tablet in my own workflow
so you have one in the pen and then one to spare there are a couple of different plugs and a charging cable and then the tablet case the case is black with a red strip down the front and it has a velcro tab on the inside to keep a tablet in and a loop for the pen so you can carry the tablet and the pen together
you can upgrade that this space by using a 32 gigabyte micro SD card if you want to have more storage you can also use the mini HDMI port to connect to the tablet to a TV screen as well
I haven't tested this function but I believe it is possible it has a quad core with an IPS touchscreen and a resolution of 1280 by 800 pixels it connects to the Wi-Fi and you can use bluetooth and there's a slot for headphones or earbuds
there's more technical info over on the webpage and you can find a link to that in the description box below and you can check out that page if you'd like to read all about all the different specs
well you can also flip the front cover back and the case turns into a stand for the tablet which is great if you want to watch a video on it and you can have a tablet standing up
I also tested out art flow and several of the other Adobe apps as well and I think it's a good idea to download a couple of different apps and test them out just to see which one you like the feel of it's completely personal preference and some drawing apps will have more capabilities than others and then the design and the workspace is very so you can really find the one that works best for you
I did have to update Autodesk when I first opened the app and to create it and created an account but once that was done I had access to all the features and I started testing out the different brushes
Autodesk I could go into each brush setting and make adjustments to the levels making them larger and smaller and varying the pressure sensitivity that I got but generally using the pen was really good
I'd much rather have a chargeable pen via a USB charger and the batteries are for a batteries and I've never seen those before but I did do a quick internet search and I can get new ones easily so that's not a problem
didn't need to
but if you ever have problems with the palm rejection feature you can use the drawing glove and that will stop the palm of your and from being recognized by the screen and also different apps have different settings so sometimes you need to go into the app
so it's good to bear that in mind and to check the settings of the drawing apps that you're using if you have any issues with the palm rejection or the pressure sensitivity of the pen after testing out the different brushes and
the tablet was to sketch and to be able to make easy adjustments to those sketches before taking them on to my main computer to color them in this is by no means a replacement for my sketchbook but I wanted to experiment with how much it could speed up my workflow especially for digital pieces and client work
I wanted to explore a bit more of what Autodesk could do and I also wanted to see how the tablet would run when I started using several layers in terms of lag and performance
I think I just got used to it very quickly even when I had several layers going on the drawing and I also had a screen recorder going as well throughout this whole drawing process
I added more layers
I'm primarily using the tablet for sketches thumbnails digital color studies and the digital art style that I use is on the simplest side so the lag was never bad at any point during working on this drawing you can certainly see it a bit and I did notice it in the beginning but as I said I got used to very quickly and after a while I really did completely stop seeing or being bothered by it which is why I think it always takes a little bit of time to get used to the device as for the accuracy of the pen
my phone has a better resolution than the tablet does but again after working for about 15 minutes it didn't bother me at all and I've been watching videos and sketching and every just everything looks nice on the tablet and this brings us to the price point of the tablet
the price point is just under $200 which makes his device much cheaper than others on the market for that price point and considering that this tablet is a multifunctional tablet you can draw
you can download apps
the screen resolution is not the highest but the tablet is much lower in price than lots of other similar multi-purpose tablets around and it does come with the pen and the case included
I can prop the tablet case up to make a stand and I can have videos playing whilst I'm working and I've also been using it to watch Skillshare classes as well so it's actually been really useful just as a media player and I've been using it a lot like that and it's much nicer to watch things on than my phone screen which is rather small
I can work at my desk or take the tablet and sit on the sofa and work and I think if you're someone who is looking for a beginner or a cheaper tablet a device that you can carry around with you one that you can watch YouTube on one that you can use as a multi-purpose media player a tablet that you can do sketches and simpler drawing done
PC I still need to use the full programs like illustrator and Photoshop but being able to do some of the sketches and color studies on the tablet before bringing them onto the computer gives me a lot more freedom to move around
what's happening everyone
that are wondering
the tablet gets an antutu score of just over 180 000 and you typically know that when a device gets a score that height will perform decent for pretty much everything
now let's take a look and see what comes in the box all right so the first thing you're gonna find is the user manual but if you've ever used an android device in the past you don't necessarily need to read that user manual
the tablet is super simple to use aside from that we are going to find a power adapter and a usbc cable so the tablet charges through a usb c port on the side now charging the tablet from zero to 100 to that charger that comes in the box takes just over three hours inside it
if you're just gonna watch videos you can probably get more than seven hours but if you do a combination of watching videos browsing the web facebook and games you're gonna get more towards five hours so it really depends how you use the tablet in the box
you're also going to find the keyboard for the tablet but you can use the tablet with a keyboard or without depending what you're doing of course so if you're using it with the keyboard it kind of becomes a small android laptop this so you can actually use it as a laptop
so the tablet does make typing a bit faster than if you to be typing on the screen now because this is a fairly small keyboard of course the keys are a bit small so it will take you a little while till um you get them used to it
this is definitely a great addition in the box there in the box there is also a stylus but this is not pressure sensitive but if you like drawing sketching this could come in handy in some situations personally
it doesn't feel natural to me but this will not feel like a stylus that you'd get on an ipad for example however as i said it could come in handy
my daughter loves on playing with it on the tablet so definitely a good addition mostly considering how cheap the whole package is and lastly the tablet well even though this is a pretty affordable tablet the back is made out of metal so this feels much more expensive than it is now
we have two speakers
if you're doing any type of um video calling next i want to show you a quick example so you can hear how those some speakers at the bottom sound
so you can see and hear how the video quality from the front-facing camera on the king pad k10 pro would look and sound like if you'd be to have a video called someone
so you just get some google apps and that's about it everything else you have to install yourself from the google play store switching between screens opening apps closing apps
that we have
so for example
you can use the browser on the left hand side of the screen for example and then you can use the youtube app on the right hand side of the screen so it really depends what you want to do with it
i've tried the browser
call of duty works
if you're into gaming there is also a gps unit inside it so if you download google maps and you download some offline maps you could use the tablet as a navigation tool it takes about on 20 30 seconds to find them your location but once
um speeds but for sensors we don't have that many sensors but that was kind of to be expected because the price of the tablet so to quickly conclude this video for its price and take it in consideration
but if you want something more powerful you're gonna have to spend double the money or more not mentioned you're not gonna get the keyboard the stylus with those tablets so it really comes down to what you plan on doing
anything like that for reading but if you want the tablet to play games constantly this may not be the best for that one but as i said you can still play games on it but it comes down to what you plan on doing with it for most people
Evo this recently went on sale for $79 on Walmart's website we have 4 gigs of RAM an Intel Celeron in 4000 and it runs Windows 10 in S mode
Evo I've seen these all over the place for really cheap but they usually run the Atom z80 350 but those atoms are really dated by now and they can hardly get out of their own way but I personally really like this little Intel Celeron in 4000
Evo 2 and one given that I only paid $80 for it but I know there's a lot of people that will be looking at this online with the sale going on and wanting to know how it performs so in this video we'll do a quick unboxing I'll go ahead and get everything set up or run some benchmarks see how this thing performs
I might test out some PC games and if everything goes ok we'll get into a little bit of emulation by the end of this video so first things first you're obviously gonna receive the tablet itself
I already noticed that the Celeron sticker is on crooked so whoever put this on and really didn't care about it and it feels like there's something loose inside of here we'll get to that in just a second inside of the accessories box
I might have to peel that off a little later on down the road so the first thing I noticed when I picked up this keyboard out of the box is it
but unfortunately mine's not working well and I'm not sure if this is going to be the case with every single one of them but mine's not making contact proper with the slightest touch
this is a dual-core
CPU at one
RAM at 21
32 gigabytes of internal storage plus a microSD card slot get up to a 256 gigabyte card as for i/o on the tablet itself we have a micro USB which will work as OTG micro HDMI a 3.5 millimeter audio jack and a single USB port on the keyboard but if it's not connecting correctly you can't even use this USB port and the Wi-Fi was a big letdown here because we do not have AC so you cannot pick up that 5 gigahertz network
and this is much better than I initially thought when I first took it out of the box that had a plastic screen protector on it and it looked horrible but as soon as I pulled that off it did alleviate a lot of the glare now
I think it does the job quite well so there are a few shortcomings that I can personally overlook given the price that I paid no AC Wi-Fi is a bummer but I've been able to get by on 2.4 gigahertz for a long time and I think I can
I shouldn't have to fiddle around with the position of the laptop to make it work now if the tablet itself had a full sized USB port built-in I wouldn't be so upset but we have to rely on that keyboard connecting correctly to access a full size USB
these are my fingerprints
I mean it's only at 1280 by 800 but it looks pretty decent for what it is it would definitely benefit a lot from AC Wi-Fi but we only have that eight or - that'll have an N chip built-in and unfortunately it's running in USB mode
I really notice a hang-up is when I'm loading up YouTube for the very first time but when I get into a video buffering is fine if I want to skip to the middle of a video without it being buffered it'll go through just fine but loading up the page for the first time does take a little bit
you so here
I just wanted to go over this real quick now the turbo speed on this does not go up to 2.6 and I think it has to do with the thermal throttling or the way they have the chip set up but we have that in four thousand four gigs of RAM and the Intel UHD 600 graphics
five megabits per second upload sixteen so it's not super fast but it's not as slow as I've seen with some of these 2.4 gigahertz chipsets so since we're here
first up
specific game
720p low settings
and that's minecraft
I've had really decent performance out of this so in the end even at a $80 price tag I would stay away from this tablet unfortunately I just ran into too many issues especially with that keyboard not working correctly
I would skip it
I had the idea of turning this into an Android tablet by installing bliss OS or another comparable Android operating system but I also want to see how Linux performs on here
thanks for watching you
the kids are home
I had a samsung tablet for about six years and they've stopped updating it so it's stuck a few Android versions behind it's slowing down and it's been dropped a few times
it still works
it's an unboxing comes with the USB cable and adapter and a QuickStart guide very important right away you can already feel just how heavy-duty this is this parts metal but the these endcaps are thick plastic
that's a pretty unboxing
this is a 10 inch tablet 10 inch screen and comes with android 9 with an 8 core cpu gps it has FM radio but it needs headphones plugged in because the wire is actually the antenna
IPS display
we've got dual speakers
it kept me entertained at the dentist waiting room for an hour and a half when reading outside you can turn on reading mode which turns the screen black and white
the contrast isn't as crisp as a pure white Kindle but it's still very readable there's also a grayscale mode which does the same thing but I don't know why they're separate or what the actual difference is
they look the same
mm web surfing the biggest hurdle is the screen itself it's glass it's very glossy and reflective but can make it hard to see without shade or in bright light again
this isn't a Kindle reader that uses LCD pixels that rely on existing light like a paper surface the LEDs need to compete with existing light and the Sun usually wins if you're like me you're usually in the shade and it won't matter
the camera is the bare minimum quality for a tablet but it's suitable for video calls and quick home movies 5 megapixel front camera 8 megapixel rear camera you'll need bright room light or use the built-in light which can give you spooky cat eyes in lower light
Samsung tablet on my prompter and it worked like a champ but I think I'll leave my old tablet on prompter duty and this one will become my main tablet pair it with some Bluetooth headphones you got it made
its hefty
like subscribe comment the
these are both the second generations of the color devices respectively by pocketbook and onyx up until this point both companies have made a six inch collider one device and they now have their 7.8 inch devices right here in front of us now
uh deep i'm not sure what the imperial measurement of that is probably some percentage of an inch but it is sunken now what we have found out in a recent tear down
if you watch our tear down video you will notice that there are a couple layers of things in front of the screen even when you don't have that glass or plastic topper now there's some good and bad points to both of these
and i just can't compare to the pocketbook in that regard so in terms of installing apps installing comixology and the kindle app and stuff like that we're not going to do any of that because the onyx does more than the pocketbook
you will see that
now it's not night and day and in fact even with your eyes you would have to nitpick and be part of a e-reader company well like us to really notice things like that but if you look at white space versus white space you will see that it is different now
comparing these two in their base forms they look very different and this is not because of either of them using a different screen tech because we can guarantee they're using the exact same screen from e-ink across both platforms however why it looks so different is because of the color control and both of them do have it although the onyx is a little bit quicker because the pocketbook is just a little bit sluggish when it comes to performance it does have contrast saturation and brightness
but what you can do is you can change all those contrasts the brightness the saturation and the watermarking so you can really cater this to your own appearance and it does look drastically different depending on what you put it at and you can revert everything to basic if you want and revert everything to basic on here as well and it'll go back to standard and that's why the standard looks so different but it is going to just come down to your saturation control brightness contrast and you can just make them look so different and it does matter kind of case by case so for a pdf like this
maybe you want to lighten the contrast and the saturation so everything kind of shines through but if you desaturate it too much it kind of looks black and white so it is hard to have a side by side when it comes to having this much control over the screen itself and this is all software from each company in its default form
although the base forms of each of these will deliver the contrast differently based on what you're using now something important again to talk about on the nova is that it is running apks which means if you don't like neoreader or the pdf reader that comes bundled with this
so there's a lot more flexibility on this the pocketbook it is just this so if you do want to if you're having trouble with this application there's not really anything you can do about it because this is the only choice so if you're thinking about switching apps to something else it's just something you can't do because it just won't let you
that's why almost no light emits from the device but it's fully displayed because it's shooting light into that layer both of these glow lights whether it's sunken screen or flush and screen and bezel
they look nearly identical
there's no spillage
the sunken screen
it's irrelevant
they actually got rid of x mode because it got in the way of the colors so they've removed that but there's just so much more that onyx can do than the pocketbook can't and it's not even a fair competition outside of just generic reading however the ink pad color is much cheaper than the onyx and it does
be it a composite
be it plastic
this is peter
it's actually running one of the latest versions of Android Android 9 and it offers a vanilla Android experience which is fantastic and row 9 is a rather recent iteration of the Android operating system
it feels really smooth and I like that all the new features that you get with Android 9 such as digital well being in terms of using the tablet day-to-day I find that
i like its versatility
this is the thinkpad x12 detachable two in one that i think is a real good challenger to the surface pro 7 and 7 plus which by the way is geared towards businesses as is a thinkpad but i think both business users and consumers will really like this
hey everybody it's andrew
plus which is moved to 11th gen tiger lake processors and also has optional lte but it retained a lot of the same physical form factor and those thick bezels that i mentioned in my surface pro 7 review so for those that didn't see my surface pro 7 review link will be in the description below
i'll put the link in the description below because that was a really good two-in-one check it out now while we'll take a look at the specs in the interest of transparency and full disclosure
my unit cost 1187.40
now keep in mind
something you don't get with the surface pro 7 or 7 plus and for those looking to buy one i'll leave a link in the description below for further information and where you can buy one and with specs and pricing out of the way
and of course you get the unit itself and holding it for the first time it feels thin and light really portable nice to see in a two in one of course especially when you want to take it on the go
now it does have that magnesium alloy chassis which is going to be rugged and durable it also has a nice black coating and one thing that surprised me not too many fingerprints
i like that now
that's good to see
not too loose
of course the nano is a clam shell whereas the x12 detachable is a two in one and here it is with the surface pro x next to it and as you can see the surface pro x has those really thin bezels
it does have a multi-stage backlight that allows you to get work done in a dark room or a dimly lit environment and i gotta say the key travel has been pretty good and i really like the tactile feedback
all right
let's check out
lock port and the volume rocker up and down and finally on the top is your power button notably missing no usba or microsd card slot and there's a physical shutter switch to turn off the webcam now behind me is my studio of course
what a disaster
there's my green screen
it's actually pretty gorgeous
it has a full hd plus resolution of 1920x1280 that means that it is a 16 to 10 aspect ratio it is a lower resolution display than the surface pro 7 and 7 plus but it really has thinner bezels and it is a very bright sharp display in
its own right now
good white points
gamut really
69 adobe rgb 68 of the dci p3 wide color gamut and 63 ntsc making this a very good choice for content creators to do lightroom photoshop and of course video editing all right
that's not the case
here you get both included at no additional cost which i really like now uses the wacom aes technology has good pressure sensitivity great for taking notes great for sketching out artwork
like you can on the surface pro devices but there is a loop on the keyboard that allows you to keep it stored on the device so there is a solution there not the best solution
i would say they're above average not too bad pretty loud filling up a room rather nicely even with a hint of bass i would say they did a pretty good job if you want
thinkpad x12 detachable
i absolutely love it
i think it's an excellent competitor to the surface pro 7 7 plus and of course even the surface pro x which i will revisit very shortly stay tuned for that new series now as far as the display full hd plus resolution 16 to 10 aspect ratio
it really works
well i like it better than the type cover you get with the surface pro 7 which you have to pay for separately by the way premium build sturdy hinge all-day battery life really good performance
and i like the fact that the pen is also included at no additional cost there are a few negatives no micro sd card slot no usba port but really not deal breakers in my book or for most people
the x12 detachable
i really like it
and it's not a three to two aspect ratio like you get on the surface line 16 to 10 is a nice blend between getting productivity work done and of course consuming media watching netflix amazon and youtube all working well on this device now
it's a bright display
covers the color gamut really well and it is color accurate so you can't ask for more but it's not quite as high of resolution as a surface pro 7 or 7 plus
please share this video
I like the key
the screen has a 1920 by 1200 resolution so it's not as sharp as a 4k display but I never felt like I was missing out for a casual sketching or taking notes
the bundled act of pen 2 is great but creatives who need a screen with accurate colors will probably want to pass regardless also while the display gets reasonably bright
jack and on the other side are USB C and USB a 3.0 ports and the power jack the USB C port is in Thunderbolt 3 but you can connect up a dock for video output in peripherals
the new chip along with its other components gave the system a noticeable bump in multi-core performance on our benchmarks but just felt snappier overall and along with the improved performance
but you'll definitely hear the fans blowing when they're under a heavy load so while it's not perfect between the performance improvements and the overall features you get a really good mid-range package for around $1,000
quick editor's note
i just found out that the g960s is actually available in amazon for 70 dollars and you get a 10 off coupon which brings the price of it down to 63 dollars before shipping that being said the comparisons
cheaper are still valid
nice feel to it
it also has a small loop on the top of it which is replaced by an eraser on the ph 2 stylus that comes with the g960s plus the packaging here is all quite minimal
honest is quite nice
as it cuts down on potential waste and doesn't add any confusion for the end user spec wise the g960s features a 9x6 inch active area which is the gold standard for medium sized graphics tablets here in 2020 and the surface feels actually quite nice
i might sound like i'm sensationalizing it but i was almost taken aback when i first did a scribble on the surface of it because it feels very similar to how a heavy pen might feel on a decent sketching paper to me
decision considering other tablets on the market in the 40 to 60 dollar range are available with 6 to 12 express keys while also being cheaper than the g960s however if the drawing service is a big factor for you
i personally am not a big express key user as i usually have my keyboard right next to my tablet while working hence it isn't a big deal for me
that's difficult to describe
unfortunately i wasn't able to test this initially as my usb port on my lg g7 died when i tried to test it i was later able to test it on a galaxy s7 though and it works as you'd expect i have a bit more info in my hs610 video on how the android functionality of tablets like these works and honestly that's about it overall
i like the tablet
if you're looking for features on paper it's not the best value on the market however its build quality and surface field do reflect a slightly higher price and at 80 dollars
what you're searching for
the drivers are reliable
the buttons feel nice
anyways a big
10 DB form but this is the second generation we on say is that they have improved a driver the functionality and also increase the pen pressure sensitivity to 8000 / levels so in this video
i'm going to see if this is actually an improvement over the previous model by the way if you find this video to be too long you can just check out my text review
is this pot here
the charging point is here on the left side when its brand new is supposed to be rep with some plastic but I've already removed that because I've been using this for a few weeks
CD is pancakes
this is the remover
I have already charged both the tablet and the pen now to turn on the power you just have to press this button here and it turns on instantly now when you hover the pen over the drawing area the light will appear and when the battery is low
there are six physical buttons here that you can customize to whatever keyboard shortcut that you want - here's a closer look at the surface texture of their drawing area
this is very smooth
I'm using Mac
I just want to show you some of the settings that you can change with the driver so when you click on this tab here press keys you can change the physical buttons you can customize specific keyboard shortcuts that you want to so you can only choose from all these options here which are basically the keys on the keyboard so we cannot type in the keys
these are Chinese words
I do not use the track pad so I actually would just turn it off right there using a check mark now in the first generation you are able to rotate using the trackpad but it was really greasy
screw-ups cool down
it depends on how you lift up your ten so if you press very hot and lift up that suddenly you get this but if you have a light touch you get very nice strokes that taper nicely so these are the strokes like this are very smooth to with some other brands or some other tablets when you draw a spirals like these sometimes the strokes they can appear angular but in this case
this isn't very smooth
any difference between two thousand and eight thousand other levels of pressure sensitivity zooming with the trackpad works very well here with Photoshop and also illustrator in the first gen eat
it works quite well
Windows as well
is this protrusion at end of the stroke which is quite ugly so if you draw the light touch or if you lift up your pen and very gradually then the stroke will appear to be smooth
illustrator is three sketches
Pro and creat are you can only zoom down but you cannot zoom back up although this trackpad supports a lot of finger gestures most of those gestures they actually do not work with graphic software for example if you are on the Mac or wave Windows Explorer you can use those trackpad to move around select files and things like that but with graphic software
this tablet is battery-powered
so if it runs low on battery you need to charge it and the downside is when this is charging you cannot draw with it for some reason while this is charging you can detect pen but when you try drawing things no stroke will appear but if this is powered up and your pen is low on battery because you draw while you are charging the pen you cannot draw more
if you have any questions let me know in the comment section below if you want to check out the text review or final where you can buy the tablet you can visit the links in the video description below
thanks for watching
hi this is
it's got android 4.4
Quick Settings panel is customizable so you can choose which applications or which features show up there and you'll notice there's also a screen brightness adapter here and that's one of the weak points of this tablet there's no automatic screen brightness
jack microphone and micro
and there's a microSD card slot in case that 16 gigs built-in storage isn't enough for your needs the Zen UI experience that Asus provides not a huge fan of custom skins for for Android
that was available
Internet issues here
I'm having internet issues
it's not dual-band
Wi-Fi it's doesn't support five gigahertz connections as far as I can tell and is 802 11 n Wi-Fi and spend a lot of time doing things like reading books on this tablet something that I like to do on tablets to sort of give them endurance tests because AC says you should be able to round nine hours of battery life and while I haven't yet sat still for nine hours to test that I've definitely spent a couple hours at a time reading books and not having problems again
there is a 7-inch version called memo pad 7 which sells for 150 and that one has lower resolution cameras not that the cameras are really anything to write home about here
there's can be little bit more pocket size and it has the same screen resolution to the same processor which is kind of nice overall though in terms of the ability to run lots of different types of applications and performance battery life
Intel's going here and they've sort of come a long way in the budget tablet space so this is less than the price of the Kindle Fire HDX less than the price of a full price Google Nexus 7 2013 Edition and offers pretty decent performance
you can find more detailed specs including benchmarks and so forth that will appearing calm but yeah if I was going to make any complaints it would be perhaps that you know I don't love the inconsistent user interface that you get when you're sort of running a software on top of Android software but once you start running any applications and it does have access to most applications from the Google Play Store
Android KitKat really
I think but you can adjust whether it's got the sound on the key press and other things like that but if you really want because it's Android you can go ahead and go into your language input settings and choose different keyboards so right now the Asus keyboard is the default but I could install a third party keyboard if I wanted to including the Google Android keyboard and use that instead so you get the versatility of an Android tablet $199 price point decent viewing angles decent performance
tablets will come a long way in the last couple of years and asus has something to do with that having manufactured the last couple of Nexus tablets for Google and now that they're partnering with Intel on this sort of device
I think I think they've got a nice little package here in a budget budget package anyways this is Brad Linder with little feuding and a quick look at the Asus memo pad 8 Android tablet for $1.99 you can find more details at Lula Keating comm and more pictures and performance results and other things
hey guys so today
it feels pretty sturdy
Bend it's nice
it was really nice
we have the pan
all right okay
this is a driver
I noticed right off
I'm right-handed myself
but usually people with who are left-handed they have issues but this is a big plus for all those of you who are actually left-handed alright so I installed the driver and was pretty straightforward
I have to unfuck my Wacom I didn't have to uninstall my driver before I did that however I did need to make sure I don't have any other software turned on when I install this because I the first time I installed it I had a bunch of stuff on and the pressure sensitivity didn't work so I had to uninstall and install it again with no software's on and now it works 8000 pressure points
I mean it has all the options you would expect like a walk Wacom for example and also you can map and put shortcuts to your pen in any way you like this one you can
it's on all so
I can use the tablet for both monitors but you can put them on one month - all right so I want to put the click sensitivity on much higher so I don't have to really put much effort into clicking
it feels good
that require a tablet
it works really well
hey guys it's me
in today's video
it's the vague vk1200
this tablet is about 10 999 pesos or 228.31 dollars in usd so first impression it's small for a pen display almost like my ipad which i'll compare the sizes later on for better visuals for you
my only concern was there was no stand to support this tablet so luckily i have my ipad stand laying around and it works just as well if you want to know where i purchased this
i contacted vic if they have stands that they may provide but sadly they don't so hopefully they'll release one soon for this tablet but in the meantime i'm just gonna use my ipad stand stand
i'm just kidding
hey jojo reference here
if you're either windows or mac i already have the driver and immediately the big vk-1200 was detected vic's driver interface is simple and easy to understood to map around
i'm just gonna calibrate the hotkeys or express keys and also the pen pressure sensitivity that i like to go for as i test out the pressure on medibang it responds well
and there's no delays nor lags at all if you're worried that the cursor and pen don't for a lack of a better term meat that is normal among displays and don't worry you'll eventually get a hang of it of course like most of my tablet reviews
i like that
you can actually adjust the screen setting as well with the brightness and etc on the side of the tablet the pressure sensitivity is working just fine throughout this process it was smooth sailing and the hotkeys works just as well
it was very matte
i suppose it was
it's really smooth
sadly they don't provide stands yet but again if you want to purchase the one i have it's linked in the description or you can just go shop around any shopping stores
but that's just for my convenience so yeah overall it's comfortable to work with the size is just right if you're not into gigantic screens taking up so much space in your room so yeah and now for my final verdict
you know wink wonk so if you wish to purchase this product be sure to check the links in the description down below and it's retailing for 10 999 pesos
on lazada thanks so much again to fake for inviting me to review one of their newest tablets so that is all for this review and if you have any questions i'll do my best to at least answer them anyways
hope y'all are having a great day and see you on the next video bye so welcome to the after video bit and you probably skipped this part to get to know what the big announcement is about but for those who sat through the whole video
were very kind enough to offer one of you to receive your very own display tablet as well think of it as an early christmas gift you know so here are the rules to enter my giveaway rule number one follow vik on twitter
big vk1200 display tablet
we have the contextual kids 7-inch tablets with a blue silicone case on it and over here on the side we also have a matching pair bluetooth headphones also contextual kids they make a great matching pair indeed and I have to say it context
it does come with a AC wall adapter two barrel pen that you can charge the tablet but you can also charge it via micro USB like you do with everything else from smartphones to camcorders to so on and so on so you can charge it by a micro USB but by any standard Patrick five volt power source such as a portable battery car charger and I have to say frankly
a silicon casing is
I love this casing
I mean it's like talked about perfect grip and it's very thick very bumper protective but look at the pin holes here that there is the DC input for the barrel pin charger
and that's your micro USB and that's the cutout for the microphone and I simply could not get a good steady connection with the casing on it just would not want to sit in there and start charging and stop now if this casing would was off no problem but with it on
however with the micro USB charging port as you can see is quite open so it will accommodate pretty much any micro USB cord regardless of the head shape because sometimes you get those cords with really wide and thick heads
USB cord as well and then of course ID here we do have the headphone jack make take note that it is deeply inset so it's gone if you use wired headphones or wired speakers it's going to have to be the straight Jack's and that that little L jacks because it's not gonna fit in there otherwise very nicely done also need to note that this casing is actually rather easy to take off which is a good thing because on the back is the TF card slot so your if you want to use an SD card for additional memory
if there's button
you hear that
plastic stand now
and that's just that's like form-fitted perfectly perfectly and this little bear does allow you with multiple multiple viewing angles like that and then in folder it all up there and actually has little feet there that prevents skidding so actually
that's it really
it's some it's plastic
it's cute see but it's actually well thought out now speaking of display this is an IPS display if you're not familiar with that my PS displayed and I'm just going to say it in practical terms whenever you look at the screen on an IPS display
whoa look at that
displays have that phasing
IPS displays but they are actually pretty clear meaning that multi viewing angles however I guarantee you that most kids including I would say a lot of dolls tend to hold their tablet straight on
I know I do
lots of pre-loaded stuff but in spite of all that pre-loaded stuff it's actually still got quite a bit of memory left and this is the bit I really want to highlight
I'm sorry 7 gigs
out of 8 left so that means 1 gig is used for you know operating system and all those games but it is non partitioned it is full non partitioned memory and that is massive now
exactly what that means
Bluetooth capable once again
tablets have bluetooth support
this does in fact
I have those contextual
they're automatically repair
adjustment this actually
and then you push this button in for Bluetooth and you get EQ and fast fast-forward and rewind of track wise and volume on this side so two separate buttons and yeah
I'm really surprised
how much functions
hands-down the best because the connotes a double as wired headphones in fact it comes with a little auxilary wired cord male to male so very nicely done end audio is actually good
I'm impressed the only thing I just really have to point out is when it comes to charging I do recommend using the micro USB while the case is on because I just simply cannot get a good fit on there but this is all for your consideration
yes yes oh
this only features one gigabyte of ram and a quad-core processor with 32 gigabytes of storage now that storage is non-flash of course and i believe it's very very slow if they improved it just a little bit the overall system performance would have been so much better so android go is stripped down version of android
and so on so everything like that seems to run just fine on it but overall the tablet is it's all right but it's very slow for a kid it would be all right but at that price point 60 pounds
I start the review
there is a manual
USB cable you can charge that habit using your computer or any existing powered USB outlet that you're using this is how the case looks like this is not real leather
it's imitation leather
this allows you to prop up the case like this so that you can watch shoes with the tablet in landscape mode and this cover it has magnetic so it snaps tight however the magnet doesn't actually switch off the tablet so you have to manually switch off the tablet if you want to power it off because I'm closing it like this
is this elastic holder
this is the type
C connection pot
this is a micro
it's not very good
it feels too echoey
it feels like the speaker's deep inside the tablet so I definitely prefer to use my headphones with this tablet rather than listening to the audio from the speakers so let's take a look at the specifications
this is the text review that I have already written on my website if there are any updates to my media review I will put that in my text review
the storage is 32
Wi-Fi connection Bluetooth GPS this is an Android tablet when you first power it on you go through the setup screen and when you reach the desktop there are only some apps included
this tablet doesn't have any blue wear and that is very good so you can install other apps that you want from the Google Play Store but for this particular combination of Android and the tablet
diagonal lines that
I'm drawing I'm drawing them slowly to test for the jitter that usually occurs when drawing with digital stylus is like this so for slow diagonal lines there is definitely some slight wobble some jitter
can you see that cursor that appears so once that cursor appears you are supposed to get good palm rejection but the tip has to be really really close to the screen so you have to put there pen close to the screen first before
I'm drawing it now
the diagonal line
I'm resting my palm on this case here so it really helps to prevent straight strokes and it can help me raise my hand as well so you do have to draw a bit faster if you want to avoid those cheetah lines and here
I usually draw
I'm using art flow
they are a bit smoother compared to sketchbook so let me show you the diagonal lines again slowly so this is definitely much smoother compared to sketchbook so the performance of the pan
to find a jitter
I just want to let you see this to let you see how the lines they actually appear when I use this in an actual situation when I'm actually drawing so the lines
they are quite smooth
they are pretty smooth
you're as well
this is quite smooth
no not the cheater and I'm drawing this at my usual speed so I don't have to draw any slower or any faster and this is how the sketch looks like pretty satisfied with that performance when it comes to actually using the stylus or drawing with art floor drawing performance and experience really depends on the app that you use this is outreach supports pressure sensitivity as well but as you can see there is some slight lag the lines they do not come out instantly beneath the tip and that's because of the app
the handwriting is
I recommend app
flew the battery
it's quite good now
it's quite responsive
the downside is the RAM is we need to gig so if you open a lot of tabs if you open a lot of apps it's going to start to slow down usually when it starts to slow down
we have the case
we have the tablet
where some of the drawing apps performance is quite good but with others not as good so overall satisfaction really depends on the app that you use for up flow
reproduction is quite good
the brightness is quite satisfactory even though the brightness range is quite limited overall performance is quite snappy this runs Android version 7 which is quite a recent version of Android but unfortunately there is no way to update the Android OS through the settings all right things that I do not like would be the resolution
P resolution screen
that's the only thing
I have to stress
nowadays you can get a good selection of drawing apps to choose from as well there are not a lot of Android tablets out there at the u.s. $200 price range that provides you with sensitivity and also a stylist dona does tell us that i know of with pressure on
Android tablet for drawing
do you like the price point and that's all for my review to date if I have any updates to my video review I will update my text review which is already published on my blog
thanks for watching
that's a mouthful
and are you know
so you can see that this is pretty portable and also still pretty large so the next thing that's noticeable that stands out that's in here is this and you might be looking at it and wondering what the heck is that
I really think this is cool it's like I don't know stainless steel or just steel or whatever the heck this is but very thin and sleek and it's magnetic so it's got two parts that come out here and you can adjust the height for how how you want your tablet to sit whatever angle you want it up
and if that's too high you can use the smaller one here and give your tablet more of a slant so if I put the tablet here it sits there pretty perfectly and I can adjust the angle too however I want and so I can give it a tall angle like that
sorry for the lighting but yeah it's really cool and I really like how portable everything is so it makes it really convenient to take with you especially for the stand
the next thing that comes in here is a glove which is very very useful because the wearing one of these prevents it prevents your hand from getting fingerprints and smudges all over your screen while you're drawing and also just helps your hand to glide smoothly on the surface so it looks like this and it makes me feel really cool
I have the pen that came with the I have the pen that came with the $50 feely on tablet that I have and you can tell there's a difference between these two pens
this one that comes in this is obviously much longer and it's actually got a bit more weight to it than this one does so it just feels more like a pen which is expected since this one comes with a more expensive tablet so it makes sense and in here they also provide a spare pen and then inside this also comes the 8 extra nibs and comes with this little ring thing to grab the nib and change it and then also another interesting thing that this tablet has is a section
I live in the US so I have you know the United States type wall plugs but if you live in a did another country you know you might have something different so this kind of covers all your bases and you can kind of take you can literally take this anywhere something
that's at that
if you're fairly new to tablets but if you have had a tablet or you've been looking for a new one you will know that tablets can be pretty expensive depending on the brand that you look at and if you're looking at something like whack comm
don't get me wrong
sorry was it no
it was a Wacom
Intuos Pro medium-size
I've ever tried out
it's their bigger tablet
you know
there's a big price difference and that you know they give you an extra pen here which is nice just in case you lose one or it breaks for some reason you know it's on the side it's got all the customizable press keys which is really nice because you know some tablets and this price range have it some tablets don't
it's big enough to have a lot of space to draw but small enough to be able to fit in a backpack and the stand also like I showed before and get pretty portable too and foldable
I had to do some calibrating when I first downloaded the drivers and started testing it out with my laptop and my pen on the screen itself wasn't exactly precise to where
it was like a little to the side but I fixed that with calibrations and it's actually pretty precise now so I'm not having any issues with that and if for some reason I was I can always recalibrate at different angles
it's really responsive to what I'm doing and I I feel like it's always just it feels really clean and I love it and even though I've never owned a Wacom Cintiq you know I'm very happy with this high
if you're looking for a nice tablet you've you're looking for a one with a screen and you know portability is always nice so but if you're if you're looking for something with a screen and you're you know either more advanced or intermediate and you're a little more serious about digital art
I mean honestly you know why not I know like I said 500 or 483 specifically can sound like a little bit of a steep price but in terms of this
so definitely give this tablet a look huion makes very nice tablets and I thank them again for sending me this one to test out and see how it works because oh this is such this is such a life changer honestly
I love it so much and I'm gonna make something too cute digital TVs and I'm excited to make charms and stickers and and they're not paying me to say any of this it just whoo throw that out there they just set this tablet to me and we're like just review it
Instagram Twitter
my shop and all my other things so please check that out if you're interested in following me elsewhere and please subscribe if you enjoyed this video and like to see more so thank you again for watching and as always
hello everybody and today
oh it's it's big
that's so huge
there we go
oh another well
what the oh
it's a taste
oh all right
go for the pen
all right
so it's a two-fingered glove so if you're left-handed it goes on your pinky finger and then the other one i don't know and then for the left it's the same thing and i got this
i used and it would make the lines go everywhere but this was probably the strain recorder's fault and not the tablets but overall i would give it a nine and a half stars you
whenever you're at home and then you could use this as a tablet whenever you're not at home because we still have a six thousand milliamp battery inside for specs
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
this tablet or mini
you're going to find the device itself we are also going to find the power adapter a user manual that's in English and German and this user manual has a lot of instructions there is also an HDMI cable in two metallic legs
it's nice cute
we also have two USB ports and one of those is a USB 3 we also have the volume up and volume down buttons and the power button and turning this around
we also have the network adapter for HDMI out another USB port and lastly the micro SD card and reset button since this can be used as a tablet the screen
it's also important
so if you take this outside here you cannot see the screen at all as for the screen sensitivity even though this is not the best that I've ever tried I haven't had any issues with it
and you can use one finger to actually navigate on the tablet type and done anything like that another important aspect for any tablet is the battery life so inside this year over 6000 million battery that takes about three and a half to 4 hours to fully charge from 0 to 100
and it really depends if you're playing games if you're just watching videos if you are browsing and so on so is able to get about five hours and a half on one battery charge and I was playing the game
we have dual band
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth when the Bluetooth is useful because you can connect some headphones you can connect a bluetooth mouse keyboard and so on and I Detroit and it does seem to work great as for the speed over Wi-Fi well they're about average and nothing out of the ordinary now that you've seen how this looks on the outside
so even though
so even like that
it's always the this one so you can go to 1080 no matter even if you're not using the display of the device itself so that in mind the maximum resolution is big
P gonna be around 720p and that could be disappointing if you're planning towards some on HD movies for other settings if we go to back back let's go back one more time so this is running
so of this workers without any issues and if we click to Windows Update here we can check out the update history so all these were installed yesterday so no issues and Buddha updates
now let's go back to system here and about and I just want to show you the Windows 10 the home editions so as I said before we have the Windows 10 Home Edition this is the CPU so the 8315 clocked at 1.4 for each
and this is a 64-bit operating system for storage here we have 64 gigs of internal storage and I've used about 20 but I have a whole bunch of stuff of installed on the device so realistically you're going to get some around 4045 gigs of internal storage but you can always put an SD card or something like that and expand that internal storage
run all the scores
basically this is going to be the motherboard and this is what we get american megatrends and all the back and the cpu is right here so we already knew
so this was the first benchmark test we've done on this device and currently the device has about 77 degrees for the CPUs temperature for our second benchmark based on the gig match for widget a multi-core score of 717 and this is probably the lowest score that I have seen for a mini PC with the CPU and the single core score it's 489
now here we can see the operating system the CPU and so on moving on to the speeds for the internal storage now even though these are in the highs that we've ever seen they're appropriate and on par with all the other mini pcs that we tried on the channel moving on to watching youtube videos so I'm using Microsoft edge
so if you don't touch the mouse or anything like that it seems to go okay but as soon as you move something of this kind of stops and lags and so on so definitely not the best experience on YouTube I've also thrown Kodi 17.1 on this mini PC and well
so let's open this one here the cooking for example so if you notice that everything kind of moves slow but it's the same of the basically any program or app it's actually open so let's try this one system we can get it going
if your patience is going to be okay if you don't have patience what doesn't work up that take the live streams seem to go okay but I've definitely seen this much much better in the past because it kind of legs here and then and again as soon as you move the mouse or anything like that
I'm going to open on a few video files that I have on a USB stick so to speak on the USB stick here unfortunately knocking its own happening everything
it's in slow motion
this is the file
60 frames per second
we wait and go
oh look at that
oh yeah but it's still a black screen out all over so I'm going oh it started but again it's in like super slow motion as you can probably tell so definitely not the best experience for watching the videos on this thing
it does actually work much better if you're just using it as a tablet so I'm not connected to screen or something like that if you use it just to the tablet it works much much better so this may have to do the fact that
I'm duplicating the screen
just have an idea
it's not totally horrible
so let's keep going
so this is how our gaming will do on this and it's time to conclude these videos so this mini PC definitely performed among the words that I've seen for any mini PC that we had on the channel here
I'm not sure why
thanks for watching
it's not as good but i used to make most of my drawings with this and it's definitely great to upgrade from this after having it for two years when i got out the box there was a little label on the screen cover so i decided to rip it off just so i can get this perfect
it makes drawing on this thing feel a lot more smooth and less smudgy and rough but personally i don't use it because i've never had those types of problems when you open the pen holder one of the caps comes with a little nibber mover and holds the spare nibs for you as well that way
it's really helpful
enjoy watch out
watch out watch out
look at the box, it is very white, it is very pretty, dude, when I saw it for the first time I wanted to cry qwq when we open the box
?! don't respond.
Brings another case that contains the extra tips of the pencil (8 in total) and one thing to change them Brings the manual which I read even in Russian, a sheet with the links to download the drivers its USB cable and ... nothing else, it is quite complete, although I could not give my opinion I have never had a tablet ... well, after downloading the drivers and configuring the keyboard shortcuts
let's try it!
I won't lie to you, it's my first tablet and I've already been testing it for a couple of weeks because at first I couldn't do a lot, I wasn't used to using it but I could draw something ... decent
the pencil has more than eight thousand pressure levels, which makes ... if you press soft, the line is thin and if you press hard, it is thick very well, because it gives you a better command over the line
I draw on a small area of ​​the tablet, I heard that is the most recommended if I use all the space, as the tablet is huge, I have to move the arm half a meter
I got it for the first time, come to my house and animate something ... Although flash betrayed me, I have tvpaint, which will be the program with which I will be animating from now on because I love it brushes, check this out!
it's realistic hair!
:O it's for cheating
haha: ^) (drawing:
plz) ... pause :,,)
let's talk about business (business woman.jpg) in their amazon store, where they have tablets of all possible sizes many have a discount, in addition to if they remove the discounts ... their prices are still quite affordable,
hey this is
though it is now lighter it only weighs 0.88 pounds which makes it really nice in hand and actually on par with the Kindle in terms of weight and the second change is on the internal specs
TI OMAP processor 1 gigabyte of RAM and 16 gigabytes of storage which all around is better than the Kindle the Kindle only has half a gigabyte of RAM and also eight gigabytes of storage on top of that there's a micro SD card slot right underneath the hook so you can add some more storage with the Nook Tablet
IPS display
hasn't actually changed too much when it comes to the software it still looks a lot like the new color and it is a heavily skinned version of Android 2.3
the first is the fact that they have a physical home button unlike the Kindle Fire and you can select that and it brings up a list of commonly used apps and shortcuts
Plus to stream video
the app selection also
isn't that great
there's Angry Birds and some other typical apps you may want but unfortunately the selection in the store just isn't as good as Amazon fire the Nook Tablet cost 250 dollars which is $50 more than Amazon's Kindle
I want to say thank you to Gowen for sending me this tablet to test out and for supporting my channel that said this is not a sponsored video and all the opinions are honest and my own
this is the second
Galman tablet I've reviewed and I've been using the first pen display as my main drawing tablet for over a year now and it's been working great and so I was interested to see what their latest model was like so
I've worked on ok
millimeter working area
I've put links to everything in the description box below so you can check that out if you want more detailed information on the specs of the tablet there is a screen protector pre-installed on the tablet and for parts of this video
there's no charging cable or battery included because the pen doesn't need any charging the pen has two customizable buttons on the side and the lower portion of the pen has a rubber like coating making it easier to grip the pen as you're working
included with the drawing tablets also in the box was a QuickStart guide a warranty card and a link to the driver manual which you can download from the Galman website online and then the pen stand and the extra nibs you can access the spare nibs by unscrewing
the top of the pen stand and they are safely stored in the base of the stand and the pen can rest in the stand either upright or horizontal then there were the cables as this is a drawing monitor
it has to be plugged into a power source and a PC or laptop to work during monitor works very much like a sudden a secondary screen for your PC or laptop
these types of drawing monitors always have a lot of cables and so separating the cables out like this not only keeps it neat but it also makes it clearer to see which cables go in the tablet and which go in the computer or laptop
Windows and Mac downloading
and the pen you can customize the level of pressure on the pen the Express keys on the tablet and the buttons on the pen if there are any keyboard shortcuts you use on a regular basis
you can set the buttons and keys on the tablet in the pen so that they'll be most efficient for you once you've made any changes you can hit apply and you can always restore everything back to default settings if you want to undo anything
there are also settings on the tablet itself color brightness contrast and so on and you can access those settings by clicking the buttons along the sides of the tablet itself the whole setup process took less than five minutes and then
I'm working in Adobe Photoshop and using some of the brushes that come with the program the first thing I wanted to do here is to test out the pen get a feel for working with it and to create a couple of practice pages just practicing thick and thin lines
I really liked this as I have quite small hands and I found that when I am working with a larger stylus it can strain my hands after a while so I found the new pen much more comfortable to use
I really really liked this feature as I'm always forgetting to charge my pen and I'm always coming to the middle of a project and then the pen isn't working so not having to remember to put the pen on charge was really nice and I liked the fact that this pen doesn't need charging another aspect I liked was not only the smaller size of the pen but the rubber coated section
but that's what it feels like and it made the pen much easier to grip not that the previous pen was hard to work with but I thought it was a good design upgrade once I got to know the pen and created a few of these practice pages I moved on to creating a finished illustration for most of this process
they didn't seem to be any noticeable lag or delay when I was working the pen moved cleanly across the screen and then the brush or the cursor followed very quickly in the past
Galman tablet as well that has a strip that heats up when I'm working on it but I found it a lot more noticeable on this smaller model as I had less surface area to work on so my hand was touching the top of the tablet more often that brings me to the other feature of this tablet and that is the size
the size of my a five sketchbook when it's opened flat now whether or not this tablet is too small is going to depend entirely on your process and preferences
and that's not something
I liked that I had the flexibility of being able to have the tablet on my lap and to turn it around as I was working on it and that was a nice aspect of having a smaller and lighter
screen tablet to work on having a smaller tablet does make it easier to take around with you so if you need to take your drawing monitor into work or out and about with your laptop or just from one room of the house to the other then
this smaller size is definitely more portable although you do need a power plug all the cables and a power source to run the tablet so it's nothing like an iPad type of tablet in terms of mobility if you have a small space or a small desk then this tablet might also be good because it doesn't take up too much room you need space for these pieces of equipment and you need to set them up near your laptop or your computer to be able to plug in all the cables so desk space is certainly something to consider if you're looking at getting one of these if you're just starting out if you're looking for your first drawing monitor then this might be a good fit especially if you want something to try out digital art on or if you're a beginner and you want a smaller and less expensive tablet normally with these types of equipment the larger the screen the more expensive
the tablet is so desk space budget and the fact that the smaller tablet is lighter and a bit more portable than the larger models are factors that might make a small screen a good option now
I found recently that the more I work digitally the more I actually prefer drawing on a sloped surface so my normal working tablet does have an adjustable stand that I can move up and down
on your tablet
it does feel more like working traditionally if the tablet is flat on your desk but I did ask Galman about the stand and they said they were looking into stands and they hope to have one for this tablet available in the near future overall
if you're looking for a more affordable drawing tablet to go with your computer or your laptop and you want a small compact size then this tablet might be a good fit for you
thank you again to
tablet and it just came out a few days ago pretty new 2020 model graphics tablet so it will be one of the first reviews on youtube about pablo ninos
and let's get started
i like it
and here's the tablet when we look at the hook we can say the tablet has a unique design right but the other parts the express keys surface pen attachments
this is a stylus
i like it
but it's not bad
um if you add a mac keyword on google when you search it anyways let's download it and guess what it opens the google drive folder and inside the software
with a lot of settings i will just do a few here set my second screen assign some functions to the pen side buttons and express keys then start testing
it doesn't work in landscape mode and also the tablet should be in portrait mode as well so you have to flip the tablet and start using it and you can teach online with your smartphone
okay okay
i cannot say the design is good or bad because i never thought about the hanging my graphics tablet but you know if you need one i think probably this is for you however i like the puppet quality guys
um the best part is it's a medium sized graphics tablet it doesn't cover too much work space and it's not small because it's hard to write on small devices okay
that's it for today
keep watching mathematics goodbye
greetings everyone a hopeful keeping one out there as some of you may or may not know my name is Alex and today we are here to do a quick review for the Amazon fire seven now I remember when Amazon first released their
at all
seven and this really is a remarkable piece of kids considering its small budget price but what is actually inside the Amazon fire seven first of all it houses a nice and clear seven inch display
the rear camera isn't particularly good coming in at only 2 megapixels and the front is only a VGA camera however inside the device it goes complete with the fairly impressive quad-core 1.3 gigahertz processor but unfortunately in turns around it only houses one gig still it has bluetooth capability and of course it can connect to both 2.4 and 5 gigahertz
the actual build of the device itself actually feels nice and secure as well as ultra smooth plus with the an option that it now comes in a variety of different colors so when it comes to ease of use and of course trying to keep up with today's modern lifestyle
I'm going to be brutally honest here because I've only been testing out this device for the past 7 days and I must admit I'm very impressed with what it can actually do remember
this is only retailing at around 50 pounds or if you can find it in the sale you'll get it even cheaper first of all the device is actually run by
Amazon's operating system
as a last resort like previously mentioned it is only 2 megapixel and there is no flash option as well in terms of game handling then you'll be pleased to know that it can handle them quite well although there may be a slight extra delay in loading times most of them
Smash Hits Super
then this is not for you the sound as well is unfortunately nothing to write home about although it does seem to be housed with a fairly large speaker unfortunately it is not stereo and only mono so it really does sound quite tinny
picks up many fingerprints so you will need to give it a fairly good wipe down after every couple of uses and finally is the battery life now although Amazon specifically states that you should be able to get a good eight hours of mix use from this if you are one of them people who constantly watch these videos or indeed constantly plays games
then you'll be needing to charge it a lot sooner than that and of course if you use it like this every single day then of course you'll need to charge it every night as well now having said all that
not forgetting that it now also comes pre-installed with Alexa the personal assistance but it is also small light ways and I found it fairly pleasurable to use but again going back to the price of its
I would highly recommend but if you are looking for something that can take high resolution pictures handle an excessive workload and of course have the option to play any game imaginable
then maybe you should look elsewhere but for someone who is maybe a mid-range tech enthusiast or just wants to sit back and read a good book whilst occasionally browsing the web then seriously
seven however if you do have any questions or comments then please feel free to put them in the comment section below and I will get back to answer as quickly as possible and of course if this video was of any use to you then please show your appreciation by giving it a beautiful thumbs up and of course clicking that fantastic subscribe button but until next time thank you once again for watching and I'll hopefully see at some points very soon thank you

a 1920 by 1080 resolution 10 express keys it works with right-handed left-handed and deaf people 8090 - levels of pressure sensitivity as well as a 233 PPS report rate and 50 80 LPI resolution even though I'm not sure what those last two things are
it's pretty simple
it was great
it's pretty simple
you will be given this very confusing looking wire with two attachments coming from one end and three attachments coming from the other the end with two attachments plugs into the tablet on the other end there is a display cable and USB both of which plug into your computer the last attachment on that and connects with the power cable which then goes into a wall outlet
About tab you can
I'll tell you about my experience with the tablet the first thing I noticed upon placing the stylus on the screen was that there was a nice amount of resistance when drawing personally
I was disappointed
the small box of wires and stuff contained the cord for charging the pen the four screws for attaching the stand the power cord the wacky multi cord for connecting the tablet to your computer a cable management velcro strap a Phillips head screwdriver which I was very happy about a pen stand slash nib remover
its tablets
I like to use different shortcut functions for if I'm drawing versus animating and that isn't feasible with this software but if you only plan on using one program then this won't be a problem for you and you can just ignore everything I just said
I have used a drawing tablet on the airplane before while it's connected to my laptop and it's anything but convenient you gotta connect your computer to a power source
it's cumbersome there are wires everywhere and it's probably the furthest thing from convenient you could imagine not to mention the tablet doesn't fit in its case with the stand attached
it's the kind of thing you just want to leave at your desk and not move anywhere thirdly not a big deal but I like pens that have an eraser function on the back
the screen is plastic
some people might want a higher resolution display but the 1080 by 1920 resolution looks crystal clear and the colors are also very nice although I didn't end up using it the included paper texture screen
protector works very well
when you draw this is of course just my opinion but I think it allows for more control when drawing lines and feels more realistic like drawing with pen on paper
Prime day deal that will be happening on July 17th in Canada and July 22nd in the US where the goemon PD 156 zero will be on sale for 20% off if you are interested check out the description for the specific times that the sale is going on
you want to see my first impressions video where i compared it to the xp pen artist 12 and the hyun canvas pro 16 click on the i card so just a quick reminder
this is really annoying and it will take me out of the zone so there are only three replacement nibs that come with the pen which isn't a lot my xv pen artist 12 and my huion canvas pro 16 both came with eight replacement nibs
just like the actual pen part too and there's no parallax or lag when i draw which is also really good as for the screen so there have been loads of days where i've used the tablet all day and it's never gotten hot at all which is really good once it did get slightly warm but it was only in the area near the power button everywhere else was normal room temperature
it has a slight bit of tooth to it so sometimes when i'm drawing on the screen i can see a light imprint of what i'd originally tried previously and it wipes off but it's rather annoying
maybe it's because of how they press into the screen so i might have to adjust how i draw as for like random miscellaneous stuff i think it would be cool if there was like a little animation in the startup screen
it is a little weird that there's no proper pen holder and i might either make one myself or buy one because i often find myself reaching to put the pen in a little pot so here are some specific issues
sometimes in the middle of drawing the pressure would just go and i'd have to restart the driver as well and sometimes it is just clip studio's fault and the pen pressure works everywhere else sometimes
it doesn't work like literally any software and i and it's 100 the driver's fault there are random sporadic moments where i hovered the pen over the tablet about you know roughly one centimeter away and it doesn't register at all and i have to move the pen away from the tablet entirely a good arm's length away and then bring it back again before the tablet then reaches the pen again
i need to have discord roll 20 and my character sheet out because when i didn't have this tablet and my previous ones broke and i had to use my backup into us so i only had one monitor on hand and oh boy it was very annoying having to like click between all the programs whilst playing dmd and i really missed my deal monitor setup so one big con is that the cintiq 16 does not come with any physical express keys there are digital express keys as well in the form of the radial menu and express menu
i'm really not a fan of those because it slows me down whilst i'm in the middle of drawing i prefer physical buttons because they're tactile and you can use them whilst you're drawing
you cannot set a keyboard shortcut to bring it up then you can pin the express menu so it doesn't go away if you are in the middle of drawing like a stroke for example and you want to flip the canvas
you'd either need to stop that stroke in order to access the buttons on the express menu and that's just not very intuitive but with a keyboard or a remote you can flip your canvas in the middle of a stroke to your heart's content
us dollars can get the xp pen 1819 remote which i got for 21 pounds which roughly costs around 35 us dollars or you could use your own keyboard instead which
how they were
everything i set to
the numpad was not working apart from one button on the whole numpad which is ridiculous so i then got the xp pen ac 19 remote and that was a game changer
thanks for watching
i start off by making sure that my canvas is exactly 1920 by 1080 pixels this way it can be like the highest quality setting on youtube and it will be the perfect like uh the the canvas proportions will be right on fire alpaca
there's this onion skin mode which will allow you to see a slightly fainter version of the layer above so each layer is a frame in your animation or animatic which allows you if you're doing uh a segment where it's frame by frame
i do this and then i import them into imovie as you can see um and in imovie it's a little bit finicky you have to decrease it to the lowest like length of time you can have it on the screen which is 0.1 seconds um so you can only get up to 10 fps unless you export it and then speed it up again later but yeah and you have to make sure you have
ken burns off
i don't have that on my other tablet that i use and it was very refreshing and it feels a lot is it you less likely to hurt your hand while using it speaking of hurting your hand while using it
you know
thank you for watching
hi there this is
currently this tablet runs on the Android Honeycomb operating system but very soon this tablet is going to get the Ice Cream Sandwich update that's Android 4 and Samsung is using the Samsung TouchWiz
UI on this
you just click on this area to get back to the apps and as this is a honeycomb tablet you might have noticed that there are no physical buttons on the tablet bezel to control there is no physical home button or anything like that and all
and this is for the multitasker this will actually list all the applications that you have recently launched and you can easily quickly switch between them for example if I just click on this the browser that was the browser
this is not a honeycomb functionality but Samsung has added that and you also if you notice let me just go to the browser or something that lets go to the browser and if you notice there is a small arrow here and if you click on that you get access to these quick applications again this is because of Samsung's TouchWiz UI and you just click on this to get back
similarly you can actually add widgets you go to the widgets pain all the widgets that are available are listed here and you can easily just drag and drop with it for example
and it's there pool and you can just switch to this paint and this is how you can actually add widgets and shortcuts deleting a widget or shortcut is also pretty easy too you just hold down the same and drag it all the way to the corner and just leave it and it's gone so overall
I would say this is one of the better tablets that I have seen in the market and I would dare to say that it's even better than the iPad
everything just looks great
the site is rendered so the rendering of the pages is very fast according to me and it works brilliantly if you click on the same also switching between the tabs is really easy is you
just close this
what do you say
Android phone apps also and if you go here we do get specific apps for the that I made for the tablet but I would say that the choice is not as big as what I've seen for native iPad apps
don't get me wrong
so let's try
I'm going to just drag my finger and that's type news and ews dot-com so as you can see you can also use the swipe gestures to easily input text and I found it to be really easy to use on this tablet so no issues with the keyboard it's great let's go back now again as I had mentioned earlier
it's pretty powerful and you don't have any problems with media playback etc and just mean and let's just play one of the videos and as you can see plays the videos without any issue and now
it's so smooth
I do not like about this tablet one big con that I found with this tablet is that and there is no micro SD saw slot or something like that
so you are stuck with the storage capacity that you have on this tablet like an iPad and that's such a shame because almost all other Android tablets to support easy expansion of storage by micro SD slot
that's thousand ATP
Samsung actually loads up
Wi-Fi sound etc
also as you can see the brightness level of this tablet is pretty good if you and it's pretty bright let me just lower the same and you can easily toggle between functions using the same
tablet is how light it is to hold the tablet looks really big but I love the fact that when you just hold this tablet it is so light to hold it as a pleasure because the weight of this tablet is so evenly balanced that you do not feel the heft of this tablet and also this tablet is pretty light if you compare it to an iPad
I didn't actually face any major problems with the same and overall I like this tablet very much so if you're looking for an Android tablet have a serious look at this Galaxy Tab 750
Randy from tech tabasco
i'm gonna give you guys an overview of the tablet itself talk around its hardware talk a little bit about the software and then at the end of the video
now the first thing we're going to do is jump in and actually have a look at the device itself and then we'll jump into the software and then i will give you my thoughts so let's get on with this video taking a closer look at the dragon touch max 10 now that 10 stands for the size of the screen which is 10 inches it features an octa core processor at 1.6 gigahertz 32 gigabytes of storage and three gigabytes of ram
this is a stereo speaker arrangement with a small grille located over the top to protect it from any dust or dirt moving around to the back of the tablet in the middle
there is a removable flap which has an sd card slot that allows you to put up to 128 gig of additional storage on the device on the back side of the casing behind the buttons
should you need to reset the device as well then in the center you will have the large dragon touch logo with the regulatory information located at the bottom now
and one
nice feature of this
here you can see
one other thing i wanted to mention with my device actually came with a screen protector already installed as well and that's another nice feature to see on the device
it isn't a lot these days however you do get yourself a mains adapter which is a standard usb type because it is usbc they do include a usbc cable
you then get a small instruction manual and a little warranty card as well now as i did show in the beginning part of the video the nice thing about this tablet is the fact that it doesn't come with a whole bloat load of apps and stuff that you don't want installed or you can't remove the os comes as a basic android 9 os with the basic android apps installed and that means you've got the maximum amount of storage space available
when i got mine after it came i think it was about 26 gigabytes of the 32 25 26 and i have installed one or two apps that have dragged it down to the 24
but it means you haven't got all of those other apps that samsung and others have a habit installing on phones and tablets these days that you just can't get rid of so that is a very nice feature that this tablet does have the next thing i want to talk to you guys about is the sound and the battery life now with regards to the battery life
this thing is actually very very good and i've had trouble draining the battery on it so much so that after five hours of constant youtube playback the battery had only gone from a hundred percent to 48 overall battery life is simply outstanding
and i do think that you could get a good full day's use out of the tablet now with regards to sound on it as i showed you earlier you do have the speakers along the bottom and the audio quality is okay
it does sound a little bit like the sound is being projected internally to the device rather than projected out of the device and it gives that sort of hollow sound to the audio a little bit however it isn't terrible and i've certainly heard much worse
volume is pretty good even on its max setting but it's not the loudest device in the room and if there is a tv on you might have to push the volume all the way up to be able to hear it
and there really are not many downsides to this device that i can think of only real thing is the sound as i said is a little bit hollow and the fact that it is quite a large device but that comes with the territory being the screen size that it is overall though if you are looking to get yourself a tablet for your family for your own use and you want one that will potentially last the day
the dragon touch max
8200 tablet
I have this device right now in front of me in the wrong direction so you can see it with the webcam which is on my monitor and we will show you some testing with HD videos
we have VDSL here so the fastest kind of Internet we can get right now in Germany and we will choose 1080p of course as a resolution and then you will see that it plays after this short little ad really smoothly even in Full HD
and as you saw it's not the fastest of course when we have a flash video running but I mean you usually don't do anything else when a flash video is running so let's choose full a DP here not a 360 P and I hope I did that now
but that's not important
that shouldn't be a problem if 1080p wasn't so let's see and because the display is so HD and we are not in the web in the web player not in the mobile player
you can see that
it looks really nice
the sun is shining actually inside my room right now so the display is also quite nicely visible but we also have an outdoor test with this device compared to the iPad
so you can see that there is not much difference and here one little thing that we don't like is the display is or this device is so thin that when you hold it and you press it from this side you see some something like this
I don't know if it's visible but there are some waves here on the side or actually anywhere you press too hard on the device it goes through and then you have waves on all kinds of places
I can't have the same problem because it's not plastic on the back it's metal and you can't actually press so hard until you left enough space here on the top also so you can't press that hard that you get these waves but still
that's also fast
3G version there is no 3G version yet announced so we will see if that's to come but there is actually GPS so as you can see you on the bottom
where's the elders the
L and then we have the D right here Tom the S and then it gives you some words and you don't even have to press the space or anything
so that's pretty nice
we can even make it a little bit smaller so we can move and with your finger faster and of course when the display flips which is disabled when HDMI is plugged in
that wasn't well oh
we have some office tools pre-installed for example of right which is kind of like word of course and it's not for free but you can write the docx documents
PowerPoint presentations actually right here and I set up a new one and it actually looks exactly like PowerPoint as far as I would say a text for example and then your keyboard opens up
okay no well
it doesn't look that much thinner to Toshiba even though it claims it's the slimmest a slimmest tablet in the world but well the iPad has a smarter design as far as I would say and you can see the connector actually there which is for charging and connecting it to your computer over USB with this cable but actually there is a microUSB cable also or port
now and on this side you can turn it on and off volume control and there is the switch for locking the display rotation which actually happened to be on then we can go out again and I can show you the camera HD which is already here and then you see the front camera so it's on as you can check here on the blue light and we have here to set up with my webcam and my 28 inch display which you already know probably from some other videos and the phone camera is pretty nice and responsive
either you can see my stomach now and it's really quite fast and you can shoot even HD videos and well I think it's a really great design and it's except for the battery life
it's not the best because then we have in a 10 minute video about 3 4 percent drainage if it's standard usage and as you saw here the display brightness is actually at maximum and we have
Times open right here and a tab which I can show you easily by just clicking that and I hope it opens up there we go and I was doomed in a little bit but you can see here that's really nice and responsive also and you can browse through the text here so thank you watching
okay so today
I'm doing a quick review video of the surface to now I've actually had this unit about three months and I enjoyed it and today I actually sold it so before I box it up
I decided I was going to do a review of it because I hadn't done one of it yet and every time I take a bath on a piece of technology as I might take a loss on it
it's you know
I always feel a bit better if I do a bit of a video to come look this is I got some fun I have it enjoying it or whatever the surface - I actually did enjoy I had the original surface or tea which was okay
it had a couple of faults and most of those faults were fixed with this model so we started very quick overview of it the body of the unit itself
I did use
mirroring work wery well
switch up top camera mic on back and then a second mic and camera on our front which we can see here along with ambient light sensor the screen on this model is the same
I have brightness
settings are good
gamut good it's not over saturated you know this is not a Retina display if you get very very close yeah you can pick up the pixels but you know
I'm something this size
1080p is adequate on
it's it's really nice but until we start getting like you know 4k kind of resolution movies and that it's it's not really gonna make a huge difference and the interface the Metro interface on the orti is virtually identical to Windows 8.1
it's an even game
I played on
this was halo
Spartan assault which
okay that's a pretty unsuccessful demonstration of Halo for you though anyway it actually does look very good the apps like the news weather apps and all that the Microsoft have done are are good like you know
it's better than a hand and the original or T and it's certainly much nicer than the pro and the pro - I still think the pro and the pro two coming in two pounds
it's just it
they're just tipping that kind of point that a modern consumer you know they need to shave a half pound and get it down to this size like I know the i5 requires additional cooling
it illuminates aluminum
this is the type
I'm pretty awful
generally you can senses
it's ten bucks more
it's it's probably word
I'm Wi-Fi connectivity
all that excellent
one great thing about it like or T and the whole new Windows platform is the SkyDrive the fact that and also the orti comes this particular model comes with 200 gigabytes of included space which is great
I mean and so because I live about four different products that all run on the Windows platform of an instant SkyDrive access even my android phone has SkyDrive access so I can pop a lot of work related materials and it's it's very very handy
well worth your time
thanks for looking
Well I sure hope
Oh Inside our box
that's a good feature
Canadian winter now that
That's gonna Come in handy and Then here's the actual tablet and the first time you ever opened one of these big old tablets that are doing 22 inches in display
Remember that screwdriver
they gave you earlier
And you're able to attach the little stand which is adjustable with those four screws so ya get that done now for the rest of the setup all you got to do is plug in the Things so you got your age to make sure this is the right way you got your HDMI
And you're here
the review part.
I really recommend uninstalling and deleting old drivers. They do not coexist peacefully, but other than that the setup was buttery smooth It really only takes about 15-20 minutes from the time you open this box to actually set it up
I feel fancy.
sure do get sweaty

not many budget tablets
the interface is very responsive and fluid launching apps and browsing of web both performed very well it can also handle some higher-end games such as extreme car driving simulators shown here for reference the Geekbench multi-core score came in at 1430 to performance is also helped by the one gig of ram included in the unit
there is a micro
unfortunately the tablet does use a special charger for the quickest charge but can be recharged with the common microUSB cable in a pinch although it charges slowly at half an amp
it's not an 8
it's not a 10
first thing is first
it's 1024 by 600
so that's going to limit you on a few things just right off the bat there is no Bluetooth so if you want bluetooth then you're not gonna have bluetooth and that's about it
it's a $38 tablet
it is GMS certified by google so that is another plus and i mean it does media consumption very well things load a tad bit slow but once you're in what you're doing
it plays back perfect
there's a black
there's a blue
they don't give you a wall adapter but you can use any wall adapter you have for your phone or whatever or you can just plug it into your PC or laptop USB and charge it up that way not a bad thing to there now again
so you've got that
and then you have the other side to it is that the price is is reflective of you know some of the specs now it does have a quad-core 1.3 gigahertz CPU in this which is decent and helps to offset that half Giga RAM
but it also has a micro SD card slot in the back where you can put up to 32 gig card in here and I've got 32 gig card in here going around the device you have an actual volume rocker on the right side with your headphone jack on the top
this is just basically telling you it's in a bunch of different directions on how to use you know some of the icons for Android their skin version of Android you know and how to connect to your Wi-Fi all have a one-year limited one-year warranty from my rule if you want to check out I ruler
so we'll leave that up here or down here and I'll put this up here for the camera so I want to show you just a few things on this so again not too bad for what you're paying for if you want to use you know if I want to say you know here is all my Google stuff
let's put this on fullscreen now you're gonna be set to you know a 360 P because of the 1024 by 600 resolution that you've got on this but as you can see that's not bad you know you're vert your verticals are not bad now does wash out a little bit on
the horizontals are great
so if you're you know watching with somebody else or you kind of have it tilted or whatever you're not going to lose any quality there so that's not that bad so it's pretty good here
Run another thing
I mean it does
I'm not gonna say that this is gonna run everything but it will run stuff like this no problem so that is a again a plus two a for a tablet of this cost another thing
I've got a us that USB cable there and it's a little fuzzy but you know hey it snaps pictures it snaps them pretty quick and then I can go back and I can take a look at it and it's not the best in the world but it's not terrible so I'm not gonna I'm not gonna kill it
I can web browser
I'll just run it
but on the verticals
check it out
hey guys today
two-in-one tablet that packs
the screen is 10.1
I missed from class to the right is where all the ports are located a USB port to connect to a mouse or charge your phone micro HDMI port micro USB port to charge the tablet a 3.5
Start button
RAM and 32 gigs of on-board storage which I believe is a solid-state drive because of how quickly the tablet turns on and loads applications though you're only able to utilize about 17 gigs out of the box
it's pretty good
I'm able to have about six to eight tabs open with a few noticeable hiccups here and there but no major lag the other software such as the office apps that are included
the biggest problem
sometimes the stand will actually collapse man it could be because I was using the touchscreen but still and sometimes the keyboard becomes unresponsive so I have to end up using the touch keyboard
one time the good thing though is that you're able to have the option to use it without the keyboard and you can connect it with the Bluetooth keyboard if you wanted with that being said when it came time for me to go to class I still found myself picking this up over my laptop
before needing to charge it or eight to nine hours of on-screen time with the brightness usually at 25 or 50 percent and energy saver was off leaving the tablet overnight on 100% brings it down to 94
I left it alone for about a week so overall I say if you're the kind of person who's looking to get all your basic needs in like browsing the web using Excel Word documents etc for school and watch videos then
if you're looking for something a little more powerful to play games on but for around the same price as this then you'll want to look at the Nvidia shield k1 all post anything
you might guess it's a 7-inch despites the Big Brother to the archives 5 internet tablet that we review a couple of months ago and it looks quite similar on the larger build
quality isn't bad
you've got the micro
what's good about the
Archos is that it costs $1.99 or maybe a bit less this review and it came from expanses USA and they're currently selling it from 193 99 in the 8 gig variety and it's cool that it's running Android
this is running over
on the way there
update screen finally loaded
what's available for free
it's kind of hard to scroll this screen but we'll take a look at entertainment applications since then seems to have a lot so here we have Lady Gaga ringtone for free beavis and butthead sound board not the high quality apps that you're used to on an Android phone for example there's no Netflix
so there's apps live better worse you do have the Google search box right here and you have the very good webkit-based web browser there is no flash since this is Android 1.5 and in fact I'll take a look what apps are installed here
which is surprising
ok we turn
there is no dedicated
so here's our website
no stereo speakers
we'll take a look at the audio player music player and you can do this body song title type performer album and so on and you can do a search if you have a lot of music on here and you don't want to scroll through the whole thing so we're just gonna pick a tune and play it so you can see it looks like and you can do things like loop fast forward cause this brings up the EQ
they've pre-loaded the LD code ebook reader which I'll show you in a minute that's available on the Android Market so you may have used that on your Android phone
I've heard the Boston Globe application which unfortunately crashes on this and I loaded a file explorer cuz the file explorer that comes with it on the desktop is very minimal
Photo Viewer sound recorder
these are pre-loaded pictures
definitely on the road
so if you want to switch pages you just do it like so and the application supports changing the brightness just by dragging your finger up and down you'll see that it has a day/night mode also that way you won't drive your spouse crazy when you read in bed at night in the dark and if you don't want to switch it to portrait mode you have to go into settings
it's not that fast
it runs an old release of Android and there aren't a lot of apps for it but still it does surf the web and it makes a decent LCD based a book reader and has a nice video player on a good music player
I've been using it
so here we go
and kind of curious
I do love
so let's get that
Newtown was smelling
this is thin
but we got the same similar adapters that we had with the other unit where you can either plug it into the wall or you can operate as a USB
we got a cloth
I was super excited about because I I do need a bigger workspace because I can't see but I did not expect this tablet to have the screen to be as big as it is and for it to be as light as it is so I'm looking forward to trying to us
Tim which is yeah
he's our mascot yeah
he's really cute
he's got a little
oh my god
I guarantee it is
what stick him out
can we take him
oh yeah he's family
is that so yes
yeah he's very cute so I think a rough texture honors that in old paint or marker or whatever you want to use he'll be kinda cool to do with him since Susan white does actually go through with a black line make it look like he's you me you accomplished
that would be cool
I'm a strong
I'm really looking forward to it now okay so I've done the drawing on the XP pen innovator 16 and I'm here with Pinkie boo and we're gonna compare this unit the innovator 16 to some other units we've reviewed on the channel now
Stevie or bubble Chan
this is a 13-inch
okay but the performance
let's show you now
we didn't review the XP 1024 inch a couple of weeks ago and I was surprised how there was like no parallax but it's the same with with this unit -
it keeps up
now the only issue
I have it
hooked up upstairs on on my name workstation but I love the the portability of this unit now it is a little bulkier than the Wacom tablet but the performance is great and I'm really glad to XP pen reached out and offered for us to review this one as well I ain't knew it existed but I think it's really pretty cool
so it's portable
I mean I think it's a great unit if you were you know like going up and down stairs or maybe you you know go someplace to do some drawing like a library or something like that but it is a little bigger than what
how know this
XP pen now there is no eraser on it you know it's lightweight doesn't take a battery now what I didn't check out is whether or not it's got tilt and yeah I think it does
who are interested again
yeah we saw that
it's actually pretty cool
this tablet is great
it's right-sized it's 16
love the stylus
that's that's insane
it did exactly what
styluses battery free

News hey guys
thanks for watching clownfish
go to clownfish support
commnets clownfish support calm
that's clownfish talk comm
with another tablet review
whoa whoa
but today is the final day he won contacted me asking me to review one of their wireless graphics tablets and I said yes mostly because of you guys asking me about this tablet all the time
I like that
oh wait maybe
I don't
okay then um okay
no almost there
I like this card
let's open it
this is pretty big
I'm just kidding wait
the only tablet
I'm King interesting
it's really big
oh my god there
so here's the pen and keep in mind guys this is Wireless so we need the USB here because we need to you know plug everything in so I'm gonna not take that out and the box for the pen holder
what's this
oh okay cool so
there we go
you're ready so we have to charge the pen first and then we are going to get everything kind of set up and we will start using the tablet so see you guys soon all right so onto the review so when
I didn't really have any issues with the tablet was more just me being mad at pencil side too because for some reason my laptop hates when I use regular paint tool
it's really nice
the there's no lag like there's no disconnect from my mind to the pen to the like to the screen which is just a huge shock to me because even with my really really old
I think if you guys want if you worry about kind of your hand being comfortable and you're thinking about getting your first tablet I really recommend you get one
you know just kind of like small areas and it was just kind of annoying so if you have big hands or you just don't want to deal with the small space then
also you guys
I just thought this format would be a little bit better for you guys so just let me know and comments if you like it like this or if you like me to show the actual tablet in the bottom of the screen like you know on the bottom left where I usually put it
I was just sketching randomly kind of practicing with this tablet and you know coloring randomly honestly like I was really shocked because the sensitivity on this pen is so nice that when I use the marker tool and the watercolor tool brush like brush tool
they gave me some really cool results that I actually really liked so I really like how the tablet actually kind of helped me use my like instruments or tools
I got it for like $100 and then I had to pay another eighty just to make it Wireless and I had to buy like a piece to attach to it and it was just a huge mess
I'm just really shocked
no it's like there's no like there's nothing bad about it that I can be like oh pros and cons you know what I mean like the only thing that just bothered me was probably my own laptop
yeah anyway
I love them
I go I just want to mention make sure to follow my Instagram or my Twitter because some exciting stuff is going on right now and you guys want to be the first ones to know trust me and I don't usually say this kind of stuff but definitely do if you don't want to miss out on the fun stuff coming up soon so yeah alright now for real goodbye
it's really nice now
has these two little extra spare ports and i want to know what those are for so i checked the manual and these are actually to link up your tablet to your phone so you can draw on your phone
i unfortunately don't have an android phone so i couldn't try this out but if you guys do let me know what it's like and now on to the speed pane so here we go
i've opened pen tools side and i'm going to do a little tummy fan art for you guys so we can test out this tablet and see how it works
i just went to the website downloaded the specific driver for this tablet model and restarted my computer and we were ready to go so i hope you enjoyed this video and again if you like my art and would like to see more of it
i'll put the link down below in the description to all the places you can find my art and i also have a patreon where i post works in progress of my videos and have a private discord and supporting me
what's happening panda nation
peter von panda
here check this out
listen this thing
it runs android 10
it is three gigs of ram and 32 gigs of on-board storage it also has a 1920 by 1200 dpi screen so it should be pretty nice and what i really wanted was just a big tablet so that i could read have pictures even flip some things up while i'm doing some live streams without doing a screen share and i didn't want to spend a thousand bucks on a tablet right so i picked this up
it's very reflective and it has a pretty small bezel all the way around which is nice it also has two cameras the back camera and the front camera the front camera here for selfies and web conferences and zoom calls is five megapixel and the back is an eight megapixel camera with autofocus
it's really cool
you can see here
it's very thin
now if we take a little tour around the sides what we have is a usbc port right there which is going to be nice for charging that bad boy up and maybe even be compatible with some usbc type accessories and then on this side
if we continue to go in the box here show you that we get a charging block and we get the usb a to usbc core a little instruction book here too but since this is android my hope is that i should just be able to power the sucker on might have to charge it
here is go ahead and start setting everything up and then i'm going to play around with it and then give you my final thoughts all right so i have been playing with this android tablet for a while and i really love it
i think is plastic
but it actually has an aluminum-like look and it's actually hard to tell when you tap it but because of the weight i think it is plastic because it's actually really easy on your hands over long periods of time so i was using this for hours in bed on the couch holding my hand and it never gets that heavy now
the other thing i want to show you is that i've taken this little cover off here in the back because despite this not having a lot of onboard storage you do have plenty of space for uh expanding that with a little tf card slot there
so i think you can hook this up to a wireless plan if you really want the ultimate importable tablet functionality so that is really cool now the other thing and maybe i can get it to do it here but if i flip it over and hit the power button and you can see me in there
you saw it unlock there and that's because it has facial recognition so what i really like about this is that it is super easy to unlock as easy as any of the other ones now that might be a feature on a lot of android devices these days especially if you have a decent enough front camera but it's actually really quick
it's been very reliable and i really love it over having to enter a passcode because especially when you install google play you know that the security policies require it to have a passcode on there
maybe are a little quicker but it does work just fine there so i do like the fact that it rotates automatically and maybe rotating a little slower just in case you just dip it
it just looks great
the colors are vibrant
is that when you are on web pages or reading or watching video you know like this little ed bullion video here or if i can go and find so if i just go and find one of my favorite channels here you know the video is smooth
you can see here
i can use the volume rockers and then the power button right there and then if i flip up in the bottom these two little things down here which i thought were maybe connectors are actually the speakers now
they get loud
they're always very clear
but they tend to be just a little bit tinny so if i crank up the volume here i'll see if i can show you inch and a quarter inch nylon strap there and hard sided case and so if you're going to just get the drone without any accessories
it's pretty nice in skydeal logo on there so i held the speaker up to my microphone here just to give you a little representation of what the sound sounds like
it's been perfectly fine
i've been using this as my little ipad screen off to the side and so it's absolutely perfect for that but if you really want that rich audio experience when watching a movie or consuming a favorite television show then you know you might want to pair up some headphones or put in some earbuds or something like that because the built-in speakers are adequate
but they're certainly not rich and they certainly don't have a lot of base to them right so that's probably uh my biggest gripe out of it but it's actually a fairly small thing now
i love the fact that if you know android which i'm not a huge android user but i can kind of muddle through it but i love the fact that when they give you just a clean install of it
it's not super heavy
it's easy to get up and running but the screen is absolutely beautiful and it's very large so for showing pictures for surfing the web for responding to email for consuming videos
so if you're looking for a very large tablet with a lot of capability where you can expand the memory where you can consume videos where you can travel with it and not necessarily have to break the bank board and not necessarily have to sweat it and babysit it
von panda out
hi folks so today
we're looking at this
and yeah
I got some really great results out of this tablet so as I said this is the Pablo Coast 16 very cool very accurate and I really like the way this was going
I managed to calibrate this and get very good results from the starless so I was fully happy with this and the way this was going now when the box arrived it came with these very very cool stickers so yeah Thank You Pablo for sending those
I love these
I wasn't quite sure
so if you are used to seeing the master titled tablets then yep they might be the coast tablet sold in your area looking at the back of the box now you can see the full stats of the tablet and on the side of the tablet
looks good
and yeah
the resolution is 1080p
which is something
it's very stylish
I'd say nothing fancy but there you go now on to mystery box number two and it has a nice branded screen cloth there which is more than you get from a lot of people but here is something that I really did like his
here's the thing that
here you have
USB see this isn't funderbolt free though this is just USB see and a mini HDMI on the other end of this cable is two USB now one of them is for the power and another HDMI
there's also a mini
I never read but there is all of the relevant information for you as well and there's also a Pablo hand glove as well and art love which you know a lot of people love
you know no
RGB no VGA cables
it's just one cable
I did notice however was I'm left-handed and that meant the buttons were on the wrong side for me and when I tried to turn it the other way up
mmm it didn't all toe flip itself and when I looked in the sayings I couldn't find anything to turn it for left-handed use so and even if I could find anything to flip it for left-handed use their legs or on the wrong way up anyway so it is mountable for an Ergotron stand so you could try that but hey let's move on to the pen test
so that's there and I'm happy with that like I say this doesn't have rotation but it's giving me even straight lines so if you're the young budding artist if you're just getting into drawing tablets if this is your first drawing tablet or you just moving up from smaller drawing tablet then this will suit you perfectly
I'm gonna do a drawing test soon and you'll be able to see the kind of artwork that you can create on this and you'll see that a tablet like this is perfectly adequate so realistically
I had no trouble whatsoever and realistically I put this down to the same issue that kind of crops of all the time which is the nib it had a very hard plastic nib
you're watching it here
it's a piece
I got something really really good out of this now maybe I was just having an amazing during day maybe I just was really comfortable in my seat or maybe this is a really good drawing tablet that I just really enjoyed working on individually
The Stand feels nice even though I can't use it because I'm a lefty unfortunately which is why I said really you know straight away at the beginning of the video if you're a right-handed person you'll love this
if you have a negative arm you can put this on an air-guitar arm and get the full use out of it even if you're a lefty so I would suggest that you know
I think we've soft the nibs making sure it works for left-handed people as well as right-handed people just tidying up those areas because realistically they've tied it up a lot of areas on this already getting away from old VGA cables and making sure that the build quality is better on this than build quality on other tablets and just the odd things like that
they've already done so much better than other tablets that are out there so just pushing it that little bit further and they really have a great tablet but I think for the money
there looks slightly greenish
I think it definitely needs a bit more color calibration now but I think all tablets do I don't think there's any tablet or any all-in-one device that is perfect out of the box
but that's because I've got the drawing tablet down flat in front of me and obviously I can't lean over fully because I got camera above my head so he's always gonna have an elongated face just by the pure fact of my dodgy viewing angle
I'd love to hear
that's kind of cool
it is a massive way to save money against something like the surface book and now also means that in a couple of years you can upgrade that laptop and still keep this you know you can then change it over and use it of a desktop and and so on and so forth
it just means that
I probably have the pop keys the other way around but I can't do that because it doesn't allow me to rotate and flip the screen if anybody does no other way that I haven't spotted then please let me know in the comments below
I would love to hear about that if anybody's got one of these and yet they know it and I just haven't figured that out I did look for quite a while and just couldn't find it
I just confined it
you'll notice there that
that looks a lot better now even though I had to fill in a bit of the background black and I managed to distort the face a bit more in other areas just to make him
look a bit creepier
like if you read the book yeah he had long gray hair and a moustache and it was that kind of a as well like the handlebar mustache so he kind of looked like a Midwestern cowboy kind of strange but they go so I didn't find any dropout or lag with the stylus
I was using a dell laptop in fact my xeon processor fetu gig that I tend to use but all of these drawing tablet reviews now which is absolutely great so I can just clean the drivers off and put new drivers on but everything seemed to run very very smoothly and I was very very happy when I use the Hokies
they were absolutely great
they had good trouble
I prefer something bigger
if you are digital pen like me you might like a larger tablet this was a digital painting yes this is kind of sketched out to do a painting so this is fine for more this style if I was taking this to the finished level and doing it fully as one of my pieces normally takes a week to two weeks yeah I prefer big tablet
that's just me
or if you're starting out you on your journey to becoming a professional digital eyes then this is a very affordable 16 inch tablet the only thing I would say is the 1080p screen
I'm explaining this is because somebody asked me this very question on another video so I'm getting into drawing and shading a bit more here and the details really coming out and I'm getting to add some nice shadow into Vlad the impaler's base and this is when he's starting to come alive for me you know
I'm really enjoying just adding in the detail but yeah the tablet is responsive and it works well and it's letting me change my brush size easily and just responding to the work that I want to do
you see now that
this is where
it really felt
they've got a lot of good features in there but I just think just needs a few more so there you go this illustration is pretty much finished and for me
it's looking pretty cool
I'm happy with this
I've done
do you like it
Pablo versus Wacom
this is shoe yarn
some reviews watched some videos and it seemed like it was a good buy for the money so I ordered it and got the tablet and I was happy with it now if I had made this review when I first few months first year owning it I would have given it a good review but now it's been a few years
I've had the tablet for a while and I just want to say that if I had my time back I would have waited a little bit longer until I had the money and I would have gotten away calm because the huion was good for the first couple years and then I started hitting problems with drivers getting my laptop to recognize it a lot of pen problems and this is a very common problem as I you know looked up more videos
is it still
especially if it's not gonna last more than a couple years and you don't want to shell out 500 bucks for something and then it doesn't last and it's done within the first two years you can't get it away so I I've been having like a lot of driver issues
it's not worth it
it's nothing but a bunch of headaches the panel scraps out like my computer recognized it for a while and then all of a sudden won't recognize it and I've gone on different forums different sites they tell you different things you know do this
it's a lot of work to try to get it to work again like reen you got to uninstall all the drivers and then reinstall all the drivers and try to get to work to me
it should just work and you shouldn't have all these headaches for the price that you're paying for it so so yeah so that's my thoughts on huion tablet versus the
so that's my rant about Huey on you know if you if you agree with me or not leave me a comment and if you've had the same nightmare same headache let me know and I will see you at the next one
because i'll be stuttering a lot on this one and i don't really sound that well because i'm kind of sick and i cannot pronounce english words that properly sometimes
so here we go
maybe because it feels like you're drawing on paper with by using a screen rather than just looking at the monitor all the time while also being confused how your hand is supposed to work however most display tablets
you know what i mean by expensive tablet brands doesn't really give you the full package of accessories whenever you buy a tablet from them so galman's packaging is really convenient for the customer though
if you have something
i'm pretty sure
it's much warmer than it should be and that is not really a big problem since you could fix it up manually with the tablet itself because there'd be a menu button for this one so you just need to fix it
i have a big preference to smaller display tablets and gammon did a really good job with this one i had no problems with the pressure sensitivity and the calibration and the pen quality for what it's worth is very lovely and doesn't really do damage or scratches on my monitor on my speed paint
when i draw lines and stuff so overall it actually had a good output and i was really pleased to what i've had and if i'm really being honest here gaomon could be my new best friend for commissions in school work and pmvs because like it had it was very good it had very good output
this tablet is very good when it comes to convenience the express keys are easy to press and are enough to have shortcuts and all and the tablet draws strokes really smoothly and gracefully and it's really affordable for a screen tablet
but you know that's just me and my preferences overall it's a very good tablet to have if you want a display tablet and if you prefer smaller work areas than wider ones
play i am going to have some time stamps in the description down below in case you want to skip to a particular drawing tablet and see my thoughts on that and so i'm going to be showing you guys in the live
i am not primarily a digital artist but i do have some experience with digital drawing and so just as a little bit of context before we get into this review
i have had this thing for over 10 years now and it is the first and only traditional drawing tablet that i've ever owned and literally i was using it up until yesterday
and so
this is a huge upgrade from that wacom wacom bamboo tablet and is going to be a little bit different from what we're reviewing today but it does kind of hopefully give you guys some context with the experience that i have thus far in terms of digital drawing and drawing me digital drawing mediums
that's insane
i guess
but they didn't tell me what the co-brand was and i am so excited that it's line play because their characters are way too cute and look at all these extra little goodies
we've got our pen and the cutest of stickers the next one in this very pretty teal box so it's got a sleeve on it okay so this one opens up like that
this is so cute
ooh squishy very cute
we've got the pen and stand over here and some more doodads that i'll deal with later another cute little ruler the notepad again and stickers and we've got a glove this time it goes on like that so last but not least
it's a toad bag
wow what a nice little touch i definitely will be using this tote bag for uh when i bring your shop orders to the post office all right so this one
one because this is actually a graphics tablet so the other two are a drawing tablet where you plug it into your computer or laptop and you draw on the drawing tablet but you have to look at your actual device's screen
i'm so excited
i love that
it's so cute
uh and i've been i've seen that i guess the the thing about their stands is that there's one yeah there's one kind of uh setting there but i'm sure that'll be fine for me
i'm gonna have so many line play stickers on all of my things and then yes we've got our little ruler again and our little notepad then we got our cables and stuff
so i've sort of like put up some rough specs here and i'm just going to talk about my experience with it and my thoughts on it in general and so as you can see here you can kind of adjust the pressure pressure sensitivity in the settings window and i went for
i usually go for a little bit softer because i have a tendency to press really hard and so i feel like if i make the pressure sensitivity a little bit softer it kind of forces me to try and have a little bit of lighter hand and that just eases my hand from cramping over time from you know drawing for hours and hours and so you can see here
i'm using photoshop
i was really really impressed by the variety and something that i was initially concerned about when i opened this up was that the image on the tablet was going to disrupt the drawing experience
but it's totally seamless
if you're a little bit more serious about drawing i think if you are interested in drawing you might as well go for this one and this is the deco 01 v2
it's still very light and thin and also quite affordable as well but i think a much better size for actually creating artwork and well of course this one is definitely a lot bigger than the first one that we looked at this one i find
it's still a comfortable size to fit on my desk along with my keyboard and i don't really have an issue with it and then similar to the first drawing tablet here you can see me testing out the pressure sensitivity and then the additional thing with this one is that it has shortcut keys on the side and so here you can see
is that this pen
has the silicone grip on it whereas the first one does not and i find that's just a nice little touch for just kind of the feel of it in your hand and as you can see here i'm testing out the pressure sensitivity again just using brushes that come with photoshop cc and something that i actually was surprised by was i preferred the feel of the tablet with the cover that it comes with
cut the edges and the way that it fits over top of the buttons and so it actually doesn't slide around or anything which i was pretty surprised by as well and yeah so from here
i kind of start out with a general gesture lines to mimic a stick figure and then using just general shapes to map out the rest of the body and as you saw earlier my experience with drawing tablets is literally just that one wacom bamboo tablet which is super small and then my ipad which i got a couple of years ago and so working on this deco 01 version 2 tablet was such a joy because i was able to use my whole arm to actually draw some of these lines as opposed to being restricted into that very tiny drawing space that i had with the bamboo tablet and it was also nice to have the express keys
this is probably not really going to be an upgrade for you but someone who doesn't own any drawing tablets or is very new to digital drawing looking to jump in to digital drawing for the very first time
uh drawing format this medium without having to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars because the price point on this thing is as far as i know right now is about 80 us dollars which is really really great for what you get
of course that being said again i don't have a ton of experience with many many different drawing tablets and since you know i spent so long just using that tiny wacom bamboo tablet
and then finally moving on to the very last one the artist 12 pro so of course this is going to be fairly different from the first two since this is going to be an actual graphics drawing tablet and so my direct comparison in my experience would be the ipad pro
but that's going to be kind of the closest reference point that i have since i've never tried another graphics drawing tablet before so something that i forgot to mention about
but the one thing that is important to note is that you can only have one driver installed at a time and so whenever i was switching to a new tablet i had to delete the previous ins in the driver and then install the new one but it doesn't really take very long so it really isn't that big of a deal and so here you can see me using the little stand that it comes with and i really like the incline that it has
i'm kind of just testing out the kind of how fast the reaction time is on these strokes and then i also originally was having troubles with the toolbar on the side here because i couldn't access the color swatches at the bottom because the screen kind of didn't extend to the very bottom but thankfully i did figure it out i just had to condense the tool so that i could access the color swatch at the bottom
i found it very intuitive and just so much easier to use instead of having to use my keyboard for zooming in and out and so long as i remembered which shortcuts
and yeah basically
i'm not primarily a digital artist and so i wanted to just do something kind of quick and fun and i would say the some of the cons with this drawing tablet was for some reason i felt like the surface when i was drawing on the surface there was slightly different textures
i was drawing at but that was kind of a strange thing whereas the tablet that i reviewed earlier uh with the little cover i felt like it was really really smooth so i'm not really sure what the deal was with that but very very minor thing that uh could be easily overlooked and then to talk about some more pros about this tablet
know space and so that element is more liberating to have all those options available to you and a nice thing about a graphics tablet is that because you're plugging it directly into a computer
it gets pretty hot fairly quickly and so i'm kind of forced to stop drawing and wait for it to cool down before i continue and so there's just a lot of flexibility in using a graphics drawing tablet for those kinds of reasons especially for long long periods of time or using kind of larger more powerful more powerful programs and so like i said while i primarily don't draw fully rendered illustrations digitally very often
i do occasionally will do a digital piece for products like stickers or i use digital programs to create enamel pin designs and things like that and i also use my drawing tablets to edit my traditional illustrations as well because when you scan a traditional piece you do always have to edit it a little bit in terms of cleaning it up and dealing with little specs and things so i definitely look forward to using these tablets in the future for all of my you know
i would say that because of its size and price point i would say it would be great for a very very young artist or even for someone who might not even be an artist
that's its kind of strengths is that it's so small and portable if you wanted to have it you know with your laptop and then with the second tablet that we looked at the deco 01v2
and it's a good enough size that you have more flexibility in your kind of capacity of drawing as opposed to the really small one but also it's not so big that it's overwhelming for someone who's new to drawing with a drawing tablet and and then of course finally with our artist 12 pro
if you don't have the money to invest in a like an ipad and an apple pencil because it those are very expensive and so this is a great compromise
i think being able to draw directly onto the screen like you would with an ipad but for a fraction of the price and the for me if i were to be investing into a graphics drawing tablet i would actually go ahead and save a little bit and get a larger version of this tablet
i would rather just go a little bit bigger so that you have more drawing space and a better kind of larger working area and overall i think that xp pen is a great brand for having such a wide variety of products for every different kind of artist no matter what level or stage
so thank you so much to xcpen for sending me these awesome products for to try out and for sponsoring this video and supporting this channel and thank you guys for watching my content and being here i am so thankful to have all of your support and yeah that pretty much wraps it up i will see you in the next one bye
alright welcome everyone
I am a comic colorist and welcome to my youtube channel and like I said the intro the video today we're going to be doing an unboxing and review of this display tablet which XP pin was kind enough to send me
I believe so yeah
so it's a 15.6 inch display it's a full HD so it's 1920 by 1080 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity so that's really high I think that's as high as the Wacom stuff 6 shortcut keys which I don't really use that much
but we'll test them out and newest technology for making the lines flow smoother and perform better according to the box here and you get a stand as my other thing so yeah we'll look at all this stuff one thing
but we'll see what that looks like in person because I don't really know I don't know what that means to the real world so we'll find we'll figure that out all right so inside
start off with plugs
I'll be using good old American style plug and there's other types here I've I don't know which countries these belong to but they won't work here and there is a cable that seems to be HDMI on one side and dual USB and a USB C
I plan on hooking this to my macbook because they did say that I'd have to remove the Wacom drivers from my desktop and I'm not interested in doing that because yeah those drivers I need them
I think to HDMI
I've never really used
there's a USBC connector a couple of rocker buttons here sort of all um-- possibly and a power button on that side and on the other side there are no connectors but we have quick button things there and that's it they were also kind enough to include a stand
this is the main cable it looks like and there is a USB to power so this will need to be plugged into the wall and then on the other end there is a USB see a USB and an HDMI and my MacBook only has USB C so I don't see a way to connect this to my macbook right now
I just checked there's only one USB C port on this so I'm going to email my contact at XP pin and see what we find out all right so it has been about a week
I'll show you guys what that looks like so I've got a lot of cables now running all over the place and honestly installation went pretty well so at first it only worked as a display and it wasn't picking up the pin but I didn't restart so I should have restarted
I started working and I did a little dabbling with it and I'll show some of that video now I assume and just the first initial notes is that keep in mind
that seemed to work
I've done so far so I thought that instead of just goofing around with it I would actually color something and just time-lapse through that and give you guys my thoughts while that runs and I would do this in real time but it's connected to my MacBook and I'm awful with the Mac keyboard shortcuts like even zooming in and out like I forget fits command or all - whatever so I don't want you guys to see me struggle through that so I'm just gonna color this little bust here by Mac's dumb bar friend and excellent artist so I'm gonna color this real quick and just kind of see what it feels like and that way and give you guys a pretty decent impression of whether I think that it's uh worth it or not so let's go you guys can probably see me
I should be pressed
I might be able to work and talk at the same time one thing I wanted to point out is and again coming from an iPad with a Retina display with a you know very high resolution very high
okay so it's full
HD 1980 by 1080 or 1920 by 1080 and I'm used to working on a much much denser display I don't know what it is on the iPad versus this
I think a $400 ish device to you know have the same specs and quality that a $2000 Cintiq does or whatever but first impressions or this would absolutely work well for beginners the other thing that I noticed and I'll try to overlay
I don't think you wouldn't notice and especially unless you've got it like side by side next to something else which which I do it's not bad I get 75% of the RGB gamut which is I mean it's not stellar but it's not terrible either and I noticed on some of the hack slash pages that I that I put it up against
I really couldn't tell much difference at all so I think it depends on the colors like I'm wondering if red is an issue like certain types of red or things that are very close to pure red if it just doesn't do well with that which that wouldn't shock me
if you know you might see a little bit more banding than then some other monitors but I tried a few big gradients with it and didn't really notice anything dramatically different while I was editing this I noticed that the stand seems to be moving quite a bit more than I could actually tell while I was working on it so I think part of the reason why it looked so dramatic here is that it's sped up but while I was actually working on it I didn't even notice that it was really moving
it's also sitting on a kind of a cushy mousepad as well so that might be part of that also so flatting with the lasso is honestly that's probably about as what's the word like precise is
I'm a little shocked
honestly it's you know
I said 400 earlier
you know
it's an expensive
I think I would recommend this to someone just starting out because at no point did I feel like I was doing lesser work or something you know because of the hardware the color gamut which I was worried about so what this means
I found this little graphic here describing it and so this triangle the large one that you can probably barely see this line right here but this triangle and going up to here this triangle all the colors in between here are what's in the like Adobe RGB color gamut which is sort of one of its one of the standards used for testing monitors
this monitor covers 75% of the big triangle there the Adobe RGB spectrum back to the video although you know if you're looking at like a rainbow-colored image with like a ton of different colors in it you might notice some some small differences between the two like the like the spiderman pictures
I said the the color gamut was better than expected to me and as far as a career world scenario now for the cons and there are a few for me
I said it's 1080p on a 15 inch screen when you're that close to it it especially where text and parts of photo shot where you're having to read things you can see pixels pretty clearly again
I always want to watch the 4k version of the movie or whatever you know like those things really stand out to me and I only really noticed it in the menus of Photoshop
you might try it and realize that it's not that big of a deal and I didn't really notice it on the canvas itself at all second thing is the the parallax I talked about earlier
you know not just put the pin right on the X and make sure it's there but make sure it's there from your eye position because it could be different if if I'm you know
the angle is different
it's not designed to be taken off that's at least my understanding for what I'm reading I don't know if that's affecting the screen quality or not because I haven't pulled it off but just something else to keep in mind so that so the screen felt a little like grabby on my hands so that's why I use the the glove that they they include because I felt like I could move easier with it one thing that I noticed on their website which is a little deceiving it says I don't think it was intended
it will not show a 4k picture what it will do from my understanding is you can connect it to a computer with a 4k display and it still works ok
you might want to disable that if you accidentally end up bumping that so I guess the last question is should you buy it if you are just starting out and budget is a big thing which usually is when you're just starting out yes absolutely
I think it's a
it's a massive price difference so for less than $400 this gets you a long long way and and and I would absolutely recommend it for that the reason the only reason that I wouldn't recommend it to quote-unquote professionals or whatever is if you're used to a higher resolution display
print photo editing
they were very close enough that I I really couldn't see that much of a difference at all although I'm sure there was there would have to be but not something that it was obvious so so check it out the links in the description if you're interested and and just to clarify
I hope you guys enjoy the video and maybe I'll do more of these if people keep sending me stuff who knows but I'll see you guys in the next one take care
Home and Student 2013
we're looking at here
it has good brightness and viewing angles but obviously a modest resolution when compared to certain competitive high-end tablets in the market for the cost and size of the device however it's really not a deal-breaker in our opinion it's still a very nice display on the top of the front bezel display
but there's a fair amount of travel in the key cab so typing is pretty comfortable generally speaking you can easily detach it from the dock just by a single push of a button here and lifting it out of the socket on bottom
there's an SD card
HDMI output port micro USB charge and data port and a two-in-one audio jack the t100 ta also comes with Bluetooth 4 and 8 an ABG and dual-band Wi-Fi onboard the backside of the t100 ta is very glossy and almost has a rubberized coating on it
TI's keyboard dock is solid and well built with a single USB 3 port on the left edge and a large multi-touch supported click pad as a sit now with solid state storage on board and Intel's Bay Trail Atom quad core processor under the hood the T 100 ta boots very quickly in about 10 or 11 seconds as you can see
it's a pretty snappy
little device general performance switching between active apps with the T 100 ta is super smooth and responsive Windows 8.1 offers really powerful multitasking capabilities as well with the ability to share screen real estate between apps and switch between them quickly just swiping in from the left edge of the screen here
performance is pretty solid
however as you can see we can also switch between the game and other active applications in the background and even share the screen and play the game on one side while the other app is active on the other side
4 but a notch behind the Nvidia shield with Tegra 4 and a couple of early prototypes of higher-end in Adam Z 3770 powered tablets that we looked at earlier this year
tablet review
hey everyone it's siege
another tablet review
we've reviewed gaomon
let the unboxing begin
looks really fancy right
i actually prefer pen cases over pen holders because i tend to misplace the pen holders so whoops then we have the pen it has 8192 levels of pen pressure
and it's battery free
and two adapters
oh there you go it does work it works perfectly fine there's pressure sensitivity which is good and um the buttons on the pen work fine as well so yay to that
keys of the tablet
tuber and artist
oh yes okay
and it's affordable
this video we're going to do a side-by-side comparison between the Wacom tablet a traditional pencil and paper and of course the trusty old Mouse and by the end of this video
I hope you're going to know whether you should spend money on a tablet or save your shekels and roll with Old Faithful Old Faithful is of course your mouse walking or not
it's coming right up
Wacom tablet so welcome sent me this beautiful walk them into US pro medium tablet and I figured I'd return the favor and talk to the good people the Internet and tell them why I need this tablet and how it stacks up to everything I use and care about so let me also throw in that
I'd be quite flattered if you would go over to the website and check it out so I've used Wacom tablets for years and this is the best tablet I've used yet
I mean that was just kind of one big plug but whatever I want to show you how this thing will change the way you work especially with graphics and photography
that's what we use our tablets for anyway so when I first wanted a tablet was years ago I had a very hard time justifying spending the money three four hundred dollars but when I finally bought the Wacom tablet and spent a few days or weeks getting used to it
not only was the whole process very smooth fluid and fast but my work got exponentially better because I was finally able to have a more exact control over any coloring or shading any dodging and burning anything like that that I was doing my artwork or photography this stupid tablet changed everything about how I work
it was like seeing
but once you've seen it impossible to go back so let's go ahead and do a side-by-side comparison and see how the Wacom stands up to a few different competitors that I've arranged so we're going to do a pencil and paper Mouse and of course the Wacom tablet so I want to cover first speed and workflow now the good old classic pencil and paper you can grab a sheets
you get results
you might need a box of pencils rubs charcoals all that stuff before you can really expand your options so kind of limited but in the right hands it's absolute dynamite however again
I'm going to give this a 10 out of 10 for functionality now touch and feel the pencil paper nothing beats the sound or feel of your favorite pencil on an amazing piece of fiber paper
it never gets old
that gets an eighth
it's super smooth
Mouse you're going to pay a little bit more than that even I'm gonna roll the $50 here though just to kind of help find a bit of an average so I'm going to give this a 7 out of 10 on the price scale and the Wacom tablet is far and away the most expensive here the Wacom Intuos Pro medium that I'm using here for this
it was 300 49.99
I'm going to give this a 4 out of 10 however you can pick up a Wacom for as little as seventy $9.99 so I'm going to add three points back in and finish out the Wacom price
also just like the mouse at a brilliant 7 out of 10 that tablet obviously isn't the pro medium shebang but it's 80 bucks instead of 349 99 so we end up with the pencil scoring 24 as you see the mouse scores a lowly 20 and the Wacom scores a lusty 31 far away blowing out the other options
I got it
thank you message from huion and inside is a warranty card with the instructions to install the driver then we got the drawing tablet itself in this plastic bag and here it is
i actually got the red one because it was the only one in stock so yeah i'll just put it aside for now so i can take out the other stuff in the box and i'm gonna throw away the plastic now
and here's the pen
well um to hold your pen of course and it's very cool just putting the pen in the pen holder instead of dropping it and the pen holder actually opens up with extra pen nibs inside in case your pendant breaks the instructions with the different languages
and wow this
drawing tablet works so good it really has a good feeling to it with the pen and having the smudgeguard glove on and when you first started out with this you might not be that good but as you draw more and more and more you get better just make some more and more artwork and you will improve that drawing with your tablet trust me
it's like a sheet of paper and once you're done with your sketch maybe take a picture of it because you will never see your sketch again and you can press the eraser button and boom and erases your sketch and you can make another one
also this is a very quick pack and go tablet because it came with the pouch for your tablet so you can take it anywhere you want with you when you are traveling so that wraps it up for the huion inspiroi inc h320m
it's super good
it's gonna slide in and out of a bag with ease if we turn it around though we get a sense of what sony is trying to do here which is to say
so you've got a really really simple unadorned back you've got a sony logo and NFC logo experience stuff a camera pod up here which we'll get into a little bit later but that's it it's incredibly sparse
you do have a sony logo and a small camera above it but really not not a whole lot to look at looking at the slides you do have an exposed headphone jack which seems a little bit silly
it does work
SD card slot
they're both sealed here
but that's there to make sure that when you do take into the shower like me you're not going to regret it next that we do also have an IR blaster so if for whatever reason one remote in your home theater system is not enough you can fire up a included application on your z2 tablet to control your television as well well
Samsung's Galaxy Note pro
it's actually very aggressive
I'm firing up
Need for Speed Most
Wanted right here
there's no way
everything runs incredibly smooth
now we're taking a look at the album app which takes the place of the stock gallery application displays all of your photos and a really attractive looking grid not a whole lot to see they're shipping into Walkman though obviously you're still able to access
same goes for movies
we've got an 8 megapixel camera with an X more sensor baked into the tablets backside and it's actually capable of capturing some pretty crisp shots not quite the same situation for the front-facing camera which is a 2 megapixel affair and leaves a bit to be desired
all that horsepower doesn't mean a thing if there isn't a battery beefy enough to keep up with it all that's why sony has installed a 6000 milliamp hour battery in this EG tablet which makes for about seven to eight hours of pretty consistent use
that means you're able to take this thing underwater and about five feet of water for 30 minutes and pull out and still be okay when Sony means the original tablet see they got the formula almost right but with the z2 here
Greg Iles TV
touch max 10 tablet
currently there's a 10% coupon so you can get it down to about 1:30 and it has a octa-core processor has 2 gigabytes of RAM and it has 32 gigabytes of internal storage along with microSD card support if you want to add additional storage it charges via micro USB so no USB see on this unfortunately inside the box you get the tablet along with a micro USB cable and a 5 watt charger so slow charger and again micro USB disappointment for
they didn't really have any framedrops too much and I mean like I said for for Hillel said over there but but basically for 140 bucks it runs completely fun
we'll run through a little bit more of this game because this game has a lot of stuff going on it in terms of like objects flying and just overall movements and other vehicles on the screen and buildings and all kinds of stuff effects that would potentially bring down the quality of the game and it looks fine too like it's not like super downgraded like the graphics it's not playing or anything so
so you're not gonna get you know a lot of performance in that without it being able to keep a ton of apps open but that's probably not a big deal for most people also speaking of you know performance because we just looked at gaming
I've used it
you're gonna at least get four hours of five hours of battery life in terms of just using this overall should be perfectly fine for watching it move a couple movies on there and then having to recharge it but again just running around here like
I'm in here
I've downloaded a couple of apps and a game so I've got about nine gigs left but you can add that microSD as well if you want in here and then check it out you can see that
yeah ok so it's not that bad when you just jump around the operating system on here performance and then let's check out a video real quick so one of its weak points these speakers
they're very bad
I'm getting about half the speed of the download and then about half the speed of the upload more or less but still very very good speeds to do basically anything that you want on the tablet as for a Geekbench v score
and you can see when you go in here and you go to compute or actually go back a little bit further and you look at this is gonna show you some respects this one has which is obviously
obviously so it's a huge drop but like I said this runs not that bad for just day-to-day tasks in terms of what you're going to do so you saw videos which
I think you're really going to enjoy it for stuff like that because I think that's generally what people use tablets for anyway is to watch movies and music and you and when you do do that you're going to want to you know plug in headphones like
this is just horrendous
you know it's gonna be great that way you can see this is I record my videos and in 4k and this can do videos up to 1080p in it it looks I think perfectly perfectly fine for the type of stuff you're gonna be doing for video watching so I think that's again what really what it's what it's all gonna be about for this tablet and then other than that guys
it's not amazing and
it looks like my face is uh built in there but it's just a reflection so cameras not amazing and you know you're just gonna use it for video chats and at that and it'll do the fine job with that's got a camera on the back as well some of the stuff here when you go into settings just to run through that with you guys and then once you get into the settings if there's a couple of things in here like tweaks you can do but we'll run through a few of these so audio profiles you can change some of your or you can change the silent or vibrate or outdoor for max volume and vibrate under storage like
there's no fingerprint either
it'll launch the camera
if ringing is on you can set up multiple users if you want on the tablet that way there's more profiles and you can kind of hide stuff if you need to
I don't know how many times are gonna push updates on this but you might not need one if you're just using it to watch movies and stuff especially if you're gonna use it for a couple of years you should be completely fine well with any of that stuff
there's also a navigation bar on here so you can switch these buttons around if you want so if you want like the back button on the left side instead of the right you can do that
it can also do something like this where you have an extra button here to bring down the the quick toggles and push it back up into your notifications and stuff like that so cool that it gives you that kind of customization but anyways like I said if you're just gonna watch videos on this I think you fine plug in some headphones use bluetooth headphones
let me open up
it'll look fine
RAM amount on here
King on here
so let's open up settings and then we've got our browser as well so you can't run multiple windows on here and do that so if you wanted to watch a video or something and browse the web or whatever you can do that at the same time on this tablet so
I'll link the tablet down below if you want to pick it up not a bad tablet for 140 bucks but also if you're coming from like a six seven hundred thousand dollar tablet and you come to this you might you might be a little less underwhelmed but it's linked down below
thanks for watching
come in two
this is the pen stand but the cool aspect about this is if you unscrew it it stores your standard nibs flex nibs etc right as well as you can see that ring
this is the nib removal tool tool so it nice way to kind of clean keep things out of the out of sight but easily accessible to in order to replace
you do get about 8 inches by 5 inches of active area so I'll give you about 40 square inches of active area to draw on whether it be an illustrator photoshop etc
it does have 2048 pressure sensitivity levels so any any slight movement or slight increase in pressure by your hand will be registered by photoshop will dive right in and a screenshot or ScreenFlow of that in a little bit
you'll have your display for kinetic connectivity and battery life so it'll basically display whether it's on off and if it's Bluetooth is active connected along the side you'll see right here is the on/off you'll have the on off switch right here the microUSB port connection as well as your Bluetooth connectivity
button right there
I lost some accuracy as well as some skipping at around 20 to 25 feet it just really honestly depends on what obstacles are in the way or if you have walls etc like that I actually was able to use it in my living room and draw actually on my television relatively easily and awesome screen size
here it's fully connected
it's on right now
you can switch it as you can see to auto scroll and zoom or I can just kind of zoom real far in down to the various pixels or zoom out right but I normally can change it to brush size if I need to is going to go
it's really accurate
this is completely wireless
I'm destroying general shape
let's say rush
that is the kind of sample or test portion of the tablet kind of showing you how it works via the screen as well as what you see on the actual display when using the tablet
I actually went out and picked up the added professional accessory kit where you can get the expanded pen grip where it can either have a cutout for the the button or not or have the wider grip
so maybe that could lead into it but the nibs did wear out a little bit faster than i would have liked the other issue that i did have with this particular
you can use this ambidextrous lee right where you can either have it on the right side or on the left the issue is they gloss this section of the pen tablet where the user would interact most with pressing the various hotkeys using the scroll wheel etc right
I really wish honestly that they just made it the same kind of dull matte finish on the entirety instead of having this gloss finish because it really got annoying
I don't like seeing the fingerprints and everything like that so I had to wipe it down a few times every time I use it so really a minor nitpick but the nibs issue was the only real big issue I had with the device you guys are worried about connectivity with the Bluetooth or any type of skipping
I found no issues whatsoever even amidst a bunch of other products that were connected via bluetooth with no issues whatsoever battery life stated versus what actual not I mean I I never actually got to the full specified number of hours that you can use this
I got anywhere
come in 2 o's for Bluetooth wireless pen tablet if you guys have any questions concerns feel free to let me know and get back to you as soon as I can and as always please subscribe and I'll catch you guys real soon with another product review piece where you heard it
hey jb here excited
you're with me today
i've never had one
see what we've got with it and then we're going to look at the stylus and how it writes because that's what i want to know really and then what is the cutter like so let's get into it jb here as you know
and i appreciate you being here and would love to hear your thoughts in the comments specifically on anything you want me to review or what we want to bring to the table here but let's get into this
and i don't know if this is what you get from amazon even though i'm going to put it in the link below so first is we have a box and i believe this is a screen protector and that kind of bums me out i was
it drives me nuts
it's just this
this has a lot of functionality to it and that can be a problematic sometimes uh it came with some extra marker nibs a um i think this is a strap for the stylus
i'm not sure
and let's see here
7.8 inches okay
okay so here
it's a little dark
and that's interesting okay
i think it's usbc
i actually have the remarkable two here which will make me have a good indicator if if i can use that one or not and then we have the stylus kind of a thick stylus again
they're accessories
it's just so cheap
this thing's plastic
i think it's cheap
it feels like plastic
this is heavy
that is the maximum
it's not horrible
i think they're close
okay now you have a clean screen so if you come over here and you want to take a note and again i think this is an indication of the bigger devices
i the colors
okay so writing
that's an a2
i mean obviously
let's go back to a2 mode and they'll take away the ghosting and refresh and when you're looking at color stuff it's not bad but again the ghosting is is there see it
i'm just not sure
oh it's on a2
i don't know i i just it's okay i'm gonna say it's okay so if you need color i just the ghosting's pretty rough and i think that's what some of my other subscribers have sent in is like the ghosting's pretty hard on it so i think as a black and white it's good
um when it
this is coleto
i think
it's close the writing
experience is not horrible
quick review of it so you kind of get an understanding and the two things i'm looking at is the stylus quality which is not great and is the note taking ability
you're doing something wrong
it maybe they can upgrade that in software and if i was going to use it for taking it's okay it's not anything that i would like the remarkable two my paper device or supernote which i would definitely go to um they still have some work to do and i wish their accessories were just a little bit better all right so as always if you like these reviews please put a thumb up that helps me um if you want more like this leave the comments below
it's about note-taking and reading and color and it's not doing any of those things fantastically but maybe there's something you need it for and and i can help you
Lenovo is more professional
that's why it's called an idea pad what this brings to the table is an IPS Gorilla Glass display and some more ports and that lovely think pad kind of look if you're think I personally I am
right here feels nice
Lenovo tablets
which means that
it's not like your finger so if you rest your hand on the glass you can tell the difference between the pen in your hand and you won't get any vectoring
Android Honeycomb tablets
don't have any buttons
some aren't go figure
but sorry we there's no 3g version yet available however that's a real sim card slot if you stick a sim card there it's not going to drop into oblivion on the inside
there's actually a carrier
there's a front facing camera here for video chat and on the back we have a 5 megapixel camera take some K photos could use a little more color saturation and tends to wash out a little bit
you know
it's available at 16 gigs of storage for $4.99 or you can get with 32 for 569 or even 64 for 669 so it's priced fairly competitive with other tier 1 tablets
lenovo is customized as you can see the front here that's a lot like the IdeaPad and that's something we wish they actually hadn't put so much of software on here the IdeaPad k1 had the same problem
there's two different video players there's Lenovo zone which is also called video player so if you tap on the video you'll get an option to play with video player or video player
McAfee security loaded here
there's a USB file copy utility as well and we're going to show you how that works it's very basic if you stick in a flash drive for example which we're going to do right now
you can select the folder if you want to copy the entire folder or if you want to take a look inside the contents you can check whatever it is you want to copy and hit the copy button and you choose where you want to put this on the USB Drive that would be non-intuitive don't things up internal sd
it's a trickle charge
it's very slow
supports both
MTP and USB mass-storage profiles but the the bad thing is if you plug it in it will not use USB mass-storage for anything except for an SD card that's inserted it won't use it for internal storage whereas MTP it will the tablet runs Android OS 3.1 honeycomb so far we have not found any updates
but that's okay
one thing about the
ThinkPad tablet is that it comes with Netflix pre-loaded just like the IdeaPad k1 and also the HTC jet stream while the Netflix works on pretty much all Android 2.2 and 2.3 OS phones finding our honeycomb tablets is still rare which is a shame
that plays great
a little tired holding
it's fully tablet
HD or wear
here's your file
this is $100 and it's a nice leather style portfolio case which so it seems from the outside and you open it up and you can see it's one of those folio style keyboard cases so you pop in the tablet right here
there's the USB port
here with very good key travel bigger-sized keys in the transformer but the keyboard dock would compared minute a little optical trackpad here and typical thing pants style buttons so pop it in so you can see how it looks there
really excellent keyboard
you've got your volume controls home button brightness menus search buttons media playback controls all up here and we've got arrow keys down at the bottom always handy and we've got a little virtual mouse here that actually functions
when you open it up you can see that you've got a trackpad here instead of the little optical eraser stick thing but you know honestly they both work pretty much as well and you've got quite a bit smaller keys here because lenovo did away with the track bear
spacing and in terms of the side by side think they're just about is wide one thing that you do manage with the transformer is to keep your USB ports because it's 2 built-in on here whereas the only USB port is on the device itself with a think pad and again once you plug it into this USB port you lose access to USB makes it a little bit less advantageous but the good part is when you have the ThinkPad inside of this
it's lighter than the transformer plus keyboard which way about three pounds together in this weighs about the two and a half or a bit less in most other respects this is your average basic normal honeycomb tablet
now you can see
3G option is coming and this is Adobe Flash we're running the latest version of Adobe Flash which is 11 now scrolling speed is fine consuming good and then we'll check out some Adobe Flash inside the browser of course this also has a YouTube player
it's a 4.3
that's not bad
there beds okay in terms of performance the NVIDIA Tegra 2 dual-core CPU benchmarks at about 1550 on this which isn't about among the top honeycomb tablets the best we've seen is 2200 or so but it's not too bad it's a little bit better than the IdeaPad k1 it manages
now let's check out video playback performance we're going to use the built-in gallery application because that performs the best for doing video playback and again if you had a USB Drive plugged in a thumb drive or an SD card that would also show up here inside of gallery but we're going to use internal storage or internal SD as its marked on android tablets to get the best possible performance
and we're going to try first with 720p high profile video so you choice video player or video player to playback and that's on par with other honeycomb tablets and it's plain just fine even though it's high profile 720p now some money come
movie trailer here that we're going to play down you're going to see a lot of frame drops so not as smooth as it could be but at least it doesn't stop you from Tron now pretend ATP standard profile
I think anyway you probably not going to play this 1080p internally because the display resolution isn't even that high but it does have HDMI out so you might want to plug in a monitor or plug this into an HDTV tomanche and this plays just fine as it does on most honeycomb tablets good framerate
that's on your butt one thing that I really like is Lenovo's customize the application picker here you can see we've got a bunch of apps running and you can actually close right from the list which is most excellent gone gone gone gone just like that really nice and easy much more expedient at going to settings and manual and killing applications just as there's some fragmentation with different versions of honeycomb which really hasn't dampened in my dad let's say one thing that is a little bit distracting is that there are just app stores popping up everywhere there's Amazon's which isn't such a bad thing - Sheba has her own and Lenovo has their own now
Trojans no viruses that kind of thing so it's pretty attractive looking here you can go between bestsellers new recommended just free stuff and it has a fairly small set of sub small
know that you can use the pen that comes with a jet stream or actually doesn't come with the pen you'd have to pay a hideous $80 extra for it but anyway that pen does it works everywhere in everything now
it's nice active kind of experience and again with the pro version this application you do get pressure sensitivity so there are third-party to support this but in terms of its built in here other than making annotations on
it is a pretty cool endeavor so this does both handwriting recognition and unless you just write and scribble will start with a handwriting recognition and you can see some stuff that
there's an undo and redo function and there's an eraser get rid of that if we want to now this stylus has a single bottom of the the HTC Flyer
you can erase there
it is so overall less capable in terms of not working everywhere but at least it does work with art applications ones that do plan to work with duo sense in trig active digitizers and it works inside of here pretty well so certainly great for handwritten notes and diagrams and okay but not fantastic for handwriting recognition
but this is the first time we've really seen handwriting recognition on Android tablet so then itself deserves some kudos the ThinkPad has a better life of about eight hours
display that has Wi-Fi 802 11 BGN dual ban Bluetooth and the GPS as well it's available now starting at $4.99 for the steam gig and go all the way up to 64 gig and similarly we're going to see a 3G version lenovo tells us and that actual SIM card slots a good hint that it is indeed coming and maybe it's not too far off no idea
it does have a tablet form factor with a built in detachable keyboard and you can remove the tablet reverse it so you can close it and keep the keyboard attached at all times without actually having the keys exposed this device
there you go
USB port micro USB port really can't charge from that it sports one of those those round chargers right there right there for you no charging the device that's the telltale sign of a cheap device has a micro SD card slot
HDMI that's a good
that's a plus
I mean if you just you know no telling how long this device is gonna last but if you needed something attached to a TV to stream video from you never have to look at it
you could tuck it away behind a drawer and and likewise use one like a bluetooth mouse like this this Microsoft sculpt bluetooth mouse and just have it connected to a TV
I haven't seen any AMD systems on a chip yet this is unlike Android wear a cheapo Android tablets not gonna sport all the same features as a I could low-end Snapdragon or a low-end and video processor most of the like the RCA tablets that run Android they'll come shipped with a like a mediatek processor and then you'll run into problems where a game won't even play properly
this does support
Intel HD graphics although it only gives you like it's a quarter of the power that you find and I like a real cheap laptop because it's it's not any branded intel HD graphics and it and it's on a small die so they can only fit like a quarter of the the cores that you you would expect to see on like a mid-range laptop that has integrated graphics
it's the plastic screen
that has the basic
that's the route that what used to be the readers where you can look at the documents but you can't actually open and operate them battery life on this thing up to 6 hours if it if it's just sitting there not doing anything
the lights are dim
the buttons are square
you know a mobile
Celeron is going to give you more horsepower than you're going to find in the these bottom will you know the the bottom line Intel Atom processors but check out some of my other videos if if you need any suggestions for the holidays

right jesus christ
let's see if it's still functioning after i dropped it and here we have the instructions so oh this is where i'm supposed to download the drivers and there is an instruction manual the glove which i will once again not use
i might use it
aha this time
yeah okay
sorry and cleaned off the glove and the thank you card for choosing huion and thank you huion for choosing me and because i am dumb i also forgot to mention that you get this thing and this thing is all the cables you need
they won't be able to use that but i'll try you guys okay so now all we have to do is get it set up which is easier said than done
okay now we can finally install it actually scratch that first we have to rearrange my whole workstation and uninstall the wacom cintiq which is what i'm currently using so let's get to work okay so i haven't done a tablet review in what feels like here so
forgive me if i'm a little rusty with this one but huion sent me this canvas 22 plus to tell you all about and i just couldn't refuse so i'm going to tell you about my personal experience with this tablet
we go the canvas
oh it's because i have short tiny hands and i can't cover as much ground with them but yeah clearly size does matter to people so you'll be the judge of that
it has an extra usb a port for external devices and a full feature type-c cable which is compatible with the three in one power cable and that can turn your android mobile device into the heart of your tablet so if you want to work using your external device you can
which is great
which is a big setup from previous models making it more reliable and stable when drawing it has 8192 pressure levels with good drop resistance and works well while drawing up to a 60 degrees angle
it isn't badly operated and doesn't require charging so you can literally just pick it up and draw whenever no always like the older canvas pro 16 which i already reviewed
it feels very secure
i haven't understanding
the cursor is very accurate around the whole screen except for a millimeter away from the edge where it starts being a bit too off where the nave is but whoever draws this nail to the edge anyway the tablet comes with a nice sturdy supportive stand that has a 20-80 degree angle to toggle around with
go over the screen
they've done this to make the design more minimalistic and i'm sure some people like that type of thing i don't even though i only tend to use one button having it missing is kind of annoying so ignore this screen in the settings menu
that's what i did
in general though they are very vibrant and the qled technique increased the color gamut to 150 percent srgb which is equal to around 150 adobe lgb which makes a super saturated display
had i not tried walking on adobe animate after so yeah if that happens to you you just gotta delete the drivers and install them again and from that point on it worked fine kind of annoying but not too much of a problem
stay spooky
temporal graphic drawing tablet
the link will be in the video description below the content on the text review and in this video is essentially the same and if there are any updates to my video review output updates in the text review this is actually a review unit
aspera will append
that's the warranty information
feels really nice
the pen tip now
and when you twist the stand you can actually open it up to reach the replacement nibs there are it included and there are two USB adapters this is USB a two kro USB and this is USB a 2 USB see so this I included to allow the tablet to work with and draw devices like Android phones and tablets so this is the Pablo a 6/10 pro graphics tablet
I like the rounded corners and I like this single piece of surface with cutouts for the buttons there are eight physical shortcut buttons or Express keys when pressed the click is audible and it's quite firm so four buttons are above the scroll wheel and four beneath and within the scroll wheel in the center
here there is another button that allows you to change the functionality of the scroll now all these buttons here you can customize them to specific keyboard shortcuts or predefined functions that keep drawing area is marked by this four white markers and the dimensions ten inches by a six point two so this is considered a medium sized tablet and this is a very comfortable size to work with the surface it's matte texture
Windows driver version
here so here
this is where you can map the drawing area to your desktop by dragging the little black dots here up and down now the aspect ratio for this tablet it's actually 16 by 10 so if you are using a 16 by 10 display
if you use many drawing programs you can create a set of shortcut specific to each program you use by clicking this plus icon and these are the it express keys that you can customize you can assign
you just have to press the button right in the center of the scroll wheel so I have assigned zoom and changing of the brush size for all the others
I have tested Photoshop
well the pen is very sensitive and accurate so I can draw very light to have the thin lines I can draw faster and harder to get the thicker lines and the lines
they taper really nicely
hot and tablet
this is photoshop on
if that's the case then it would mean that both my Mac and Windows driver they have glitches and now let me show you how that habit performs with Android devices so you need at least Android version 6 in order to work with this habit and not all Android phones and tablets will show the cursor when you are drawing this is Samsung Galaxy Tab s 6
however if you have a tablet that doesn't come with a pen then it makes more sense to get a tablet to draw on to get that final control right now
Pablo tablet so
I've just drawn a rectangle to show you the active area and the reason why I'm working with both tablets in portrait orientation is because if I were to rotate this tablet into landscape orientation like this so all the icons they rotate to reflect the landscape orientation ideally I should also rotate my tablet but if I rotate my tablet and if I draw from left to right you see this happens as I draw from left to right it draws from top to now what I'm trying to say is the orientation of the software of the tablet
it's not going to match the walk-around is to lock the orientation using Android settings and then rotate the tablet so now I can rotate the Pablo tablet and Orin tation will match this orientation but the thing is all icons here they will not rotate so they are going to look a bit weird because they are like 90 degrees off all right to conclude this habit it looks good
Android devices so the orientation of this tablet it doesn't change automatically when you rotate your Android phone or tablet and secondly even though pressure sensitivity works on Android when you are using this tablet it doesn't work perfectly and how well it works really depends on the app that you are using to sum it up the
Pablo is 610
and if you use code lavender town when you check out you'll also get five percent off now the type of drawing tablet you should look for depends on your budget and your needs
you're going to be drawing on the tablet but you're going to be looking at your computer and it'll be essentially moving your mouse with the pen giving you more delicate movements than you could ever do with the mouse
i really fell in love with these as soon as i got the chance to draw on them and lately i've been having a lot of trouble with the screen tablet
i was using before in fact it was completely incompatible with my computer's new os so that was really unfortunate for me and i hadn't been able to use one for a long time
i'm going to do a full review and unboxing at the end of this video and get more into the nitty-gritty of what specifically i like about this tablet but for now i just want to kind of explain to you how you set a tablet like this up and what i recommend as far as like button configurations so as soon as you get your tablet out of the box and you want to plug it in and start using it you got to make sure to get the drivers off the website of the manufacturer
once you do that
you're going to get this little like menu thing and you're going to be able to control a lot about your tablet from there including the pen pressure and all kinds of other little features but the most important thing that i recommend you do right away before you get into any habits with your tablet is to program the different buttons
the one above that is the fill tool which i use a lot and the last one is just a command to go to my like pen tool which i draw with the most i actually had to do it inverted
because i'm a lefty so i basically use the tablet upside down um you can use it actually any configuration which is really interesting like you can use it up and down if you wanted to
not every tablet
i recommend this model
which if you're drawing for super long hours you might want to try to focus on sitting a little bit more nicely to your body and i like to use my tablet uh just with drawing in my dominant hand of course and then resting my non-dominant hand on the buttons and just using those for all my common keystrokes something
you should be very gentle with them because they are quite sensitive so make sure that you're always uh reading up on exactly what's appropriate for your tablet and make sure not to be like leaving anything on top of it um you know
make sure
um because i scraped all of the like nice papery texture off of my first tablet because i left the nib on for like two straight years and didn't realize that it had sharpened into a knife like point that was scraping all of the nice like finishing off of my tablet so especially with screen tablets where you absolutely do not want any scratches or anything
make sure that your your nib is relatively fresh and that you're just checking up on it and taking good care of it so now that i've covered some of the main tips that i give a beginner to drawing tablets
it has tons and tons of buttons for me to program to my heart's content and it came with tons of little goodies and things that are actually really crucial to tablets like this in particular
you don't need batteries or you don't need to charge it which is also something i would really watch out for if you're interested in a tablet and you realize that the pen needs to be recharged
it's really frustrating
this pen um as well as some postcards and other things i recommend trying to get the anniversary edition of any of these tablets that i showed today because they just come with all this extra cute stuff um and there's also like some really big sales because of the anniversary as well so definitely check out the link in the description
if you're in the market for a tablet it would be a great time to buy one if you have any questions about drawing tablets or how to use them

hello every Dolby
living eletronic reviewed items
SD memory card
Asus video master together with true to life and true vivid and technology between to guarantee every image strikes or a perfect imbalance between em contrast sharpness color and clarity brightness for I'm realistic results it also has a HD in-plane and switching display with wide 178 degree viewing angle and if so it brings a bigger and picture he also has a tu-22m life true to life and feature add just a bright Ness and he has also has a blue light filter also that helps to reduce I am fatigue and he also has a strong M sound with a brand the brand that they own Asus operates with his dts-hd and this speaks out to speakers at the front he also has a built in a micro Merrick rest and compatibility as well and like I said he takes a micro SD memory card no NFC built booing but I'll you know a tablet doesn't really need that and it has Android 7.0
I'm operating this okay
so for example
everything is touch sensitive
he has a break
Zen motion
I'm sayings Asus
cover looks am scream kids mode as well so if you're getting this for kid and he also has the kids mode so he's put put in there and they can't really go to any kind of you know for example the browser etc
and a case
that's it it comes over as you see a charger and it comes with a USB type-c cable as well so in my opinion I do highly recommend a go search engine type in aces and pad z30 1m android tablet other than that
we've got the pen
it doesn't lock onto the tablet or anything but the grips are so rubbery that it almost seems to cling to the tablet regardless so some goods there some bads there not really anything too substantial
because it's actually a lot lighter than any other tablet pen that i've used so far except for maybe the xp pen deco which i used a long long time ago and that one was designed more like a pencil
this one is very light and very thin at the top still no eraser but i've never used the erasers myself but otherwise it's the usual battery free pen design that you've come to expect the plugs and also the screen buttons are all on the left side of the tablet next to the express keys
i could see that this might be a little bit more difficult for somebody who is left-handed to use if you want the express keys on the right-hand side the tablet plug
well it is usb-c which means that it's reversible if you reverse it you wind up going over the power button which would be really annoying to deal with going
however it's a noticeable difference because out of the box with a quick switch to one of the presets the colors practically were identical between my tablet monitor and my main monitor
the calibration software is easy to use very accurate and only leaves you off by like less than a millimeter down in the corners even so it stays accurate even up to the corners which is very nice
you can import and export settings if you need to back things up or if you need to move them to a different tablet driver or different computer etc overall i got to give the visuals a 4.8 out of 5.
the only way it could get any better would be if there was absolutely no parallax but that's a very difficult goal to attain and that drives up the cost by a lot for the overall feel
i had an issue on another tablet where the screen protector felt a little bit plasticky and as a result when drawing at certain angles it led to this really irritating screeching sound like nails on a chalkboard
there's also 60 degrees of tilt support for anybody who uses tilt on any other brushes as mentioned the pen is also very lightweight and i really like the design of it
it's more padded than other models that i've used before by default it turns windows ink on which i always turn off because i always have issues with it one of such issues
however this isn't specific to xp pen because literally every single tablet i've used has had this issue in csp so for the overall feel i would give this a 4.8 out of 5.
it's one of their newest models so it's a little bit pricier than other third-party competitors but it has a lot going for it that make it worthwhile for the value
if it's just outside your budget maybe keep an eye out to see if it ever drops in price or if there's a sale or anything like that if you're interested in getting this tablet yourself you can check the description for a link to the store page anyway
hopefully that'll change soon
hello everyone so today
I'm reviewing for this
it's bigger screen
I'd probably say is about 4 out of 5 stars but because yet to pay for the apps when you already paid for the tablet I'll give it about 3 out of 5 stars so give or take on the price makes it worth it or not but at least it's not glitchy versus the PBS tablet
and this is the
Motorola design board
this is available on Verizon Wireless it's none of elbows a Wi-Fi only tablet and it's interesting because it has an eight point two inch display hence the name now 7-inch tablets are common 10-inch tablets are common but eight inch tablets not so much the Vizio eight inch tablets about the only one with its more four by three ish aspect ratio and this one stinks with the standard honeycomb 16 by 10 aspect ratio
it's unique it's interesting
there's your speaker hole
here's your micro
I'm bored 10.1
and the razor on Verizon and there is no spot here no blank for the micro SD card slot it does not have a micro SD card slot along the bottom edge
nothing at all
but that was ok because your hands just rest right on the edge and power button and the volume controls are right on your fingertips that way granted they could use more tactile feel but this is just well plain a little bit strange
this has an AV remote control with an IR port and up top so obviously gonna be using this one in portrait mode versus his eye board 10.1 which has it on the long edge and on the back again similar to the 10.1 but a few differences here's your 5 megapixel camera with LED flash
I unscrewed them
there's a little bit of blue goo that holds them in place and the back panel still doesn't pop off easily probably has some black and some goo on it too and since is reviewing it what we didn't want destroy it but here in comparison here is the design board 10.1
I don't know if this is a compression fit for this aluminum panel here but they didn't see a need for screws here so it's strange different design there and here we've got the Zhai board 8.2
on the 10.1
Goldilocks right sometimes
so they're working on that and it runs a pretty vanilla implementation of Android so there shouldn't be a whole lot that stands in the way there are some third-party apps added on by Verizon and Motorola but the ice itself is pretty much standard and the widgets are to stock Android widgets
let's see right here
perhaps they're not pushing
USB host cable not sure that's a valve only where they sold it as a camera connection kit Campbell for the zoom but any USB host cable will work a USB on-the-go cable micro USB 2 full size female USB over there make sure it's a host cable just not a little adapter connector thingy and we've got a 32 gig flash drive connected and played a little sound when we plugged in a happy little
I'm using Android explorer
you can use any file manager you want and looking at the contents of the flash drive and I've got some movies on here so we'll just try one it's an mpeg-4 video
so that's a handy thing to have since there isn't a microSD card side you can actually use things like flash drives with your little adapter cable and carry a whole lot of movies around obviously set on a 32 gig flash drive like we've got here also it works with mice and keyboards - you must be important but you probably want to use a Bluetooth one in fact
well correct if
we are in a smaller package here and it certainly keeps up well with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 plus one of the things that really sets as I bought it apart is the fact that it has Verizon LTE 4G Rison has pretty good national coverage ready for their 4G LTE networking very good speeds we average about 15 megabit per second down and about 3 up according to the speedtest.net application with a pretty terrible 2 bar connection that equals about 110 DB signal for LTE and in good coverage areas
DB signals so certainly good stuff and that means for you people who are road warriors on the go you're not always near a Wi-Fi hotspot or you don't have on my thigh or that kind of thing this guy has built-in LTE and you can use it anywhere
I don't know probably we will but I bet you're verizon gets an exclusive for several months first the 8.2 sells for 29 with a two-year contract and it's $5.99 without a contract for the 16
gig the 32 gig is going to set you back a hundred dollars more so this is not a cheap tablet but carrier offered tablets rarely arms and jet stream is certainly expensive design board 10
Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1
this design board
and you can see
pack app you do get moto kasih which is a really awesome application with that you can wirelessly access your Mac or your Windows PC and get all your files on and off of it you can use your your computer as a streaming media server
use that moto cast
USB the Installer will pop up on your desktop when you the sin over USB so you can just run it and install it and that acts as your interface to copy files back and forth it also has iTunes syncing which I know a lot of you like so you can sync your iTunes playlist everything
really fun game
that's golf 2
it's funny that sketches
we've got the usual
Verizon data counter widget
we've got it
we've also got
Quick Office HD here then you can pull files off the cloud here for MS Office stuff you can create a new document and you can see your selections here new word new excel new
you can always upgrade if you want so you've got office in your pocket with this thing too and of course we using a Bluetooth keyboard or something like that even more capable device for streaming video
you're plenty of options
we'll take a look at that we're using Verizon's LTE connection right now at the pre mediocre signal for load even faster so you get the wallet videos over here and you can pick whatever it is you want to watch
you can see really nice presentation here with related videos and all that kind of thing too sometimes pretty nice you don't have to have Adobe Flash questions that's out that as well you remember
we mentioned earlier that has an IR blaster that says a little window right here and it does IR control of your home theater equipment TV stereo all that kind of stuff and it works with a program
that's included called digit
not just your home theater gear but also provides you with the TV grid so digit runs in portrait mode because the IR window is up top versus the zyb or 10.1 where it runs in landscape mode because our windows on the long side so we've got our TV grid right here
you see right here
I like the UI a little bit better on those iboard 10.1 LS because you can have them side-by-side at the same time which is pretty handy but you can see
it's a pretty basic one so I can replicate every button on your device but it works and then you can choose between all the stuff that you've set up like we've got a cable box set up a Samsung TV Sony receiver
it's going to control your cable box and switch to that channel for you so it's pretty cool stuff and we're glad that more and more tablets are getting this feature right now cuz
there's a visual bookmarks still using Verizon LTE here with a teeny little one bar signal at the moment that was just fine and we'll check out our signboard 10.1
video review
let's see how to
oh that's pretty nice if you want to watch videos and stuff like that on it but you get the bigger battery you get the active digitizer with the pen as well as somewhat improved reception and a little bit faster synthetic benchmarking speed experientially
seems to work
oh yeah yeah again
yeah it's open
[ __ ] dumbass [ __ ] idiot don't question me help me so if your expertise deduction skills weren't able to help you realize you want sent me their new inspirate 320m and I gotta say it's uh it's pretty sweet first off
[ __ ] tried to do Kirishima in season three of boku no hero academia the hue on in sport Inc H 320 M is a pretty nice ass tablet and that's to be speaking from experience
I've had a Wacom Intuos and currently have the hue on GT 190 so I somewhat have knowledge on tablets although this isn't a screen tablet like my GT 190 using it personally feels like an upgrade depend on the HP 20 M isn't too fat or too skinny for my taste
you can program the pen settings to hide city overall performance of this is really really smooth and I love on a pen fills on the tablet and the pressure sensitivity is all around pretty dope but that actually is not where it ends
[ __ ]
you can also use this on your phone these nifty USB and USB C adapters plugged into your phone and you can use it no drivers needed just plug and play that [ __ ] I can use this feature to write funny or harmless little messages
see easy peasy
you can use with your tablet on the device it just kind of all comes together like pretty nice like of course the tablet comes in just like this nice little like shade of red and the black
beggars can't be choosers
and if anything he wants sending this to me to review has made me want to draw even more than before and I have been really like an artistic dip and block for like the past year and some look
remind fear your art skills all of the links to what you need if you want to purchase the tablet or in the description because not everyone has that of just getting a tablet to review for free
I had to make sure to get the right color outside to be accused of you know whitewashing myself or something slidin that I never mentioned it but a few weeks ago out with Twitter and write a famous for a grip which was actually uh kind of pretty funny at least I think it was
I'd really like to thank you on for hooking your boy up with one of their new joints and it's kind of weird for me because I never think that I begin to sponsor and realistically I'll probably never get one ever again
this tablet is affordable
you can purchase one of this for around 40 to 50 pounds in uk currency and it's designed for kids now one thing that really stands out for this kid's tablet is the case
there's less chances of this breaking because of this case because this will protect it and this also acts as a standard as well so you can actually use this as a stand
so it's pretty useful
now bear in mind
doesn't have no flash
um to the settings
you can still go on play store and download more kids app karaoke as well so it does have a few um kids that pre-installed so they can use those and let's go to settings it is slightly slow but for kids it should
especially if you're if at all still trying to navigate through certain things on web browser etc if the kid is not using it he is quite slow so bear that in mind but i like one thing i like about this is that it has smart parental controls so you can
I'm going to be trying out seven different drawing tablets and trying to find the best one the worst one and basically which one you should get depending on what stage of your art career you're in
I'll start by showing you guys the cheapest and the oldest ones and then I will finish with some unboxings of the brand-new fancy err models that are currently on the market first up the huion of 420 now
but not much else
I think that the look is really cute and should get a five out of five however the design lacks a lot of things that you really need on a drawing tablet such as programmable buttons and an eraser things like that and I think that having a battery inside the pen makes it a little too heavy and lastly for the feel of actually drawing in it I give it a 2 out of 5 now
Wacom tablet that
I looked it up and it looks like you can get one on eBay for only $60 right now I think I'd give it a 5 out of 5 on the e value because this is the first tablet I've ever used this under $100 that really works just about as well as you need it to
there were buttons or an eraser but the feel is a five out of five next up is the Wacom Intuos 4 at a medium size and this is the first tablet that I ever got
and it has worked like a charm ever since it has eight buttons not including the one at the center of the touch wheel and there's also two buttons on the pen as well as an eraser
that doesn't have one
now this is the brand-new version of the Wacom Intuos and quite a few things have changed since I last have seen and in two O's I got it sent to me brand new from Wacom so I decided to wait to unbox it until I was filming this video now
I also like that
my only problem with the whole design is that there is no eraser and that does really bother me as someone who uses mine a lot so the design gets a four out of five
it just works perfectly
it is a 13-inch
I have had these types of screened tablets before and I'll show you the one that I had been using previously right after this one but I was just shocked that a tablet with a screen could be as light and slim as this one
I was actually quite worried that it would be overwhelming to have so many cords but luckily they give you a little metal hub that you plug them all into so it actually becomes fairly simple and straightforward to figure out where they're all supposed to go to and then you can just sort of push them all into a little cranny behind your computer and everything actually ends up looking pretty neat so I was really glad about that because I hate having cords sort of flipping out all over the place
it just really adds to the design and makes it all feel more substantial so the price for this tablet is $800 and that's pretty shockingly low for a screen type tablet like this so
tEEX have often been over and dollars for a new one so I was pleasantly surprised by the price if this tablet lasts as long as all my other Wacom stuff
it's just a beautiful tablet and the screen is somehow nice to draw on but also very clear and colorful to look at which is a hard balance to strike
I was going to take a half point off because there's no buttons on the tablet itself but I realized that adding physical buttons would in fact ruin the super seamless design so
I don't know if you've noticed a running theme through this video but my parents have been extremely supportive of my drawing and my drawing career all throughout my life even when I was not very good um so I credit them majorly with a lot of the things I've been able to achieve with my art because I really don't know how far I would have gotten without them
it costs about $1,500
it's still very responsive
so it kind of got disqualified from this review but I did want to bring it up because it is only $22 and it is much more substantial than huion one from what I remember from the last time that I used it
it didn't hold a battery for very long and since it doesn't work anymore that might say something about its durability so keep those things in mind so that was my review of seven different drawing tablets
I can answer
I will try to answer some down in the comments and I will see you guys in the next video big thank you to my patrons including Calvin poem dr. cascade Elizabeth album hope chilsen JJJ left the blah blah blah mic adaptable oak amore
hello girls and guys
their comments one reviewer had said that hey you did not let us know if the tablet had bluetooth or not and for that year this tablet does not have bluetooth but it does come with some pretty cool features for being a budget tablet number one
even you know
Windows tablets
working on this tablet
I get started
you try to open that up and it will not open so to answer that viewers response not every one of the apps works with this device and I'll say it again
I realize that not every one of the apps is going to work with with any kind of device so but like I said just to answer that viewers response unfortunately dots of stuff but dots will not run on this device
the battery gets hot
I always have to let this device kind of cool off if I use it for a long period of time and I've also noticed that when I was doing research on trying to find myself
a budget tablet that some of the budget the reviews about the budget tablets especially on the Walmart website where they left their customer review had claimed that some of the devices do get kind of hot now
I had claimed I had said in my first video that when I first got this tablet that when I powered it off I've noticed that such as beautiful widgets when you are when you powered it back on guys girls guys that when you power the device back on after being off that like beautiful widgets would not load up
I know when I first got this tablet actually I returned the first one but I had due to that fact that what I'm talking about now and I got this
I've had and it also was doing it really bad when I first took it out of the box started using it power that off and I had gotten to work
I just put it in sleep mode and then next time I go to use it which it doesn't use the battery up that much and I'm gonna try to power this on and that's another thing with this device too as well you have to hold the power key forever for this thing to power own you begin to wonder if it will ever come home but the second one was doing as well you know
I put it in sleep mode and it hasn't been doing it to me that much when I power it off just two days ago I fired it off turned it back on and it either to me then I had to put beautiful widgets back up had to put SwiftKey back is my the keyboard
I don't know how to do that but I can't promise that it'll do what I'm saying but it is a little bug in this device that I've noticed and the live wallpaper come up
bring up the keyboard
see what kind of keyboard pops up and SwiftKey comes up so that that's good but I had noticed that that you know what's doing that also I feel like there is what any more items that I need to cover
I had also I had contacted the folks over at next book and I talked ones were customer representatives that I had asked them I you know I said hey
I've noticed that you know when you power the device off and stuff doesn't load back up and I said well well anything be offered in a software update and it even claimed I had even seen it on their website
the next books website that they will be offering software updates for this tablet and you can also go into the app drawer and I believe this upgrade option is where it checks for software updates
I they are
they had no
I have no idea
I can say that you can't go wrong by purchasing this device if really if you just plan on checking email browsing the internet this thing is it's like a race car
but if you plan on playing a game such as like modern warfare games or any kind of racing games anything that really puts a strain on the any kind of a process or this tablet
I've noticed that it will tend to lag pretty bad but as I said just is using it as a general device such as you not want to pull out the laptop and and you know turn that on or you know you just plop down in the recliner watch some TV
check your emails
see you later
hi i'm vicki
kids edition tablet
but um it's very limited and i did find with the leappad that we were getting to a stage where not so much that the games weren't of interest to them
big kid tablet now
i know that at some point they will in a fit of rage fling the tablet at the wall or down the stairs so i felt that a ipad probably wouldn't cope particularly well with that kind of treatment
i actually i did it before christmas day because i thought i don't want to be doing it on christmas day but actually by the time i'd selected um and answered questions such as what is their name
actually that was it and then i charged them and wrap them up for christmas so setting it up is really really easy setting up the individual profiles and what you get on an amazon fire
books tv shows films a whole range of amazon content available for your kid to use whenever so as you can see a whole range of sort of amazon prime tv shows movies
so your child can't go into google and start like looking up all kinds of crazy stuff so you can feel like really really reassured when your child is on this tablet in the kids plus app that they're not being exposed to anything that you need to worry about okay so you don't need to be looking over their shoulder and worrying about it
you can see
there's the option that this is a fully working normal tablet that an adult would use um which is great if you want the tablet to be used by multiple family members as well
she doesn't have my pin number so she can't access anything else on this tablet so everything to do with wi-fi access um additional access to any parts of the internet is all password protected
well i've summarized it's like games apps books movies tv but there is so much and seriously it is so cool so my kids are completely obsessed by the games
um they spend a lot of time on the games and we're going to talk about how you can solve that kind of problem in just a minute but um it's really cool the range of games on there now
obviously there's you're sort of you know very very simple um tapping and fighting monsters and getting bing to do all kinds of crazy stuff but there's educational games on there as well
there's games with like quite a lot of value to it and there's things where they can practice their drawing they can practice their art so there's a huge range of books on the amazon kids
if you don't have prime then it's three pounds 99th month per child that will automatically go on your prime account at the end of your one year free but i would say there's so much um stuff on here that it is well worth having the subscription so when it comes to navigating around the tablet your child can either look at their downloads
so if your child loves peppa pig they can go to here and they can see all of the movies and tv about peppa pig apps and games involving peppa pig web videos involving peppa pig and books involving peppa pig
you've got cbb's characters
if they're like really really into something like disney princesses say then they can access a whole range of content about that theme in these particular areas so navigating the tablets is really easy and i found that both of my kids adapted really really quickly to using it
they didn't really do very much so they had an idea of how to use a touch screen but in terms of like the interface of navigating around this tablet and figuring out like where their favorite stuff is how to find more stuff
and of course there is a search function as well up at the top and your child can also take videos and pictures and there is a camera here and there's also a camera at the front
it's not just robust
so it's not particularly heavy and it comes with this cool stand so that you can stand it up on a table and your child can go hands-free stand it up on a table
stand up in front of them on the sofa or whatever and prop it up on their tummy so they can watch it so that makes it a little bit easier as well
i would say when it's brand new and we haven't quite got to the point where i felt that the battery has started to um you know you know how things start to lose their charge after a while
but we've had these for three months now and battery's still working really well so yeah i would say we probably get about 10 to 11 hours out of one full charge which i think is pretty good going so the tablet comes with 32 gigabytes of storage built in which is great but you do actually find
so if you want to free up space you need to go in press and hold down on an app and then remove it from the device to free up the storage so i mean 32
gigs is good
you just pull away the cover which comes off pretty easily and there's an sd card slot so we have done that and that does help um just a little note on putting in the sd card when you put in the sd card you need to like format it from your adult
put the sim card
and um mount it from your adult account so you can't like do big admin type jobs from the kids account so that's just something to bear in mind if you put it in and just try and use it from the kids account it won't work and i've got a step-by-step process for adding the sd card on my blog
another huge huge perk of choosing this as a tablet for your child is that amazon will replace it if your child breaks it within the first two years so one of my big sort of worries about getting the tablet was screen time so as parents were often told that screen time is something to be worried about that we need to manage it with our kids and i totally agree with that
not doing anything else
they've spent in each section of the tablet so i can see how many hours they've spent on books on the games on the apps on videos on audible for both kids so both kids are here
okay so if your kid has run off then i'm not giving this up because you know like you're trying to take this tablet away you can shut it down from your phone or i can set daily limits
this is really great so it allows you to divide it up weekdays weekends i can have no limits at all i can turn the limits on i can set what time the limits um begin
what time they end
i'm happy for her to use so for example i can say unlimited reading books unlimited listening to audible but i can limit apps games videos to whatever i want
and that you found it useful paid for this with my own money paid for both of them with my own money and i would thoroughly thoroughly recommend them as a tablet for your child
they are fantastic
because you get this two-year guarantee if it does break but it seems like really really sturdy um with the case and i think most importantly of all the kids absolutely love them
taro shimla here
it was on sale
Windows tablet with keyboard
yeah one or 10.1
not the best but you know for something it's under $200 and not bad especially when you got it out himself 480 like I did operating system we got Windows 10 Intel quad core display 10.1 inch diagonal 1280 by 800 IPS
not the best camera
you know
you know for $80
there's your power brick and then in here there we go you got your USB type-c your power brick for charging which is good and then this guy up then we've got the keyboard attachment
like right here
you know
nice quiet keys
yeah although
at first glance
the higher grade laptops out there surprising this system does pack a kick using an Intel Atom quad-core processor and even though it only has 2 gigabytes of RAM doing small tasks like surfing
only one tab of course there's a built-in tablet mode in the device so it optimized things a bit which might be a bit more usable than trying to use a full alleged
I was typing resulting in this mess of a masterpiece now of course this is not a gaming PC while I did manage to get steam up and running here very few titles are supported and the ones that work didn't start up at all upon starting up you might get a notification at Microsoft's big April
now you can use a micro SD card to up the storage and download the update to that but the process is really tricky and may not be very user friendly to someone now
makes it a hard sell especially when over half of it is used to store the operating system including more would have made this a really impressive piece of hardware but the limitations out of the box are more than what you will get it out of the system as a whole
please don't forget to
Jotaro Chima peace out
they work quite well
Android device
which is this one
and there's a white model the main and the only difference as far as I can tell is the black model has 32 gigs of internal storage and sixteen and the white one even has 16 gigs of internal storage so the main features um I like about this
I'm quite enjoying it
I have done but you know it does come with the stand which I was quite impressed with because it doesn't actually lift that but it comes with a stand so quite like that and there is an SD slot and also which is up here
just all charges through the micro sd and there's also a three enough no audio jack so the USB OTG is sort of useful I guess if you're wanting to watch something that's on your external storage device of your choice and you also need to charge your tablet at the same time
there is an Asus skin which I have now bypassed because I didn't like it and I'll just put Google now skin on because I like having an app tray
I did was stick
a new launcher on
I don't use easy
it's just your standard
Android tablet it's two gigs ram HD screen 10 inch screen apparently 1920 by 1200 pixels an odd number and L but there you go but your life is okay
so that's pretty much it for this tablet is Android no gate as I've said you can customize it the art content especially if user rooty you could obviously do what you want angle everything works is as snappy as you want it to
all the games
hi everyone
I deleted it once by accident so I'm going to go ahead and do this review and I kind of wanted to compare it to the Fire HD 10 because Amazon just released this and I really believe that the the lenovo type 210 here is a lot nicer tablet for the price
it's got these
it's got a micro
and there's also the USB port and then the volume and the volume and power buttons are up here in the left corner and so that's it as far as ports are concerned so it's just as the regular USB port for charging nowyou proprietary cable which is nice so like I said the screen is nicer on this tablet than it is on Amazon's tablet that tablet has 149 pixels per inch
it does
it looks good
as i've been coming from in the past we've got the the notification menu up here you can ask the settings and everything from there it takes a double swipe so initially you just swipe down and it will just bring that layer in these type again or if you use two fingers you can bring the whole thing down at once and you can access quick things from there like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth so this tablet does have bluetooth it has GPS
I'll go ahead and show some of these apps and I'll show some of these benchmarks for people that are interested in that I wanted to show some PDFs and some ebooks magazines and stuff like that on this larger screen and with the high-resolution show you guys how it looks let's first let's talk about some of the unique settings here so this is a like I said Android 5.0
and this is
in here we can customize for instance just your features this is kind of a cool feature so when your tablet is turned off you can use these gesture features to turn it on so if I have it turned off
it'll open the web browser but it doesn't work with your lately usually when I do that it just turns it back on ever since the last update so I don't know if the deal that is so one of the things with the display options in here you have this mirror vision you can customize the screen exactly how you want it
but if you want to set up user mode you can come in here and customize the color temperature the dynamic contrast you can go ahead and customize all this
so there's some custom picture mode settings you can customize in here with the mirror vision app so as far as audio goes there's also the Atmos app so this comes with the Adobe Atmos app
and I haven't had any problems with that sense you can customize these or some different ones in here that you can set on those different patterns you can use
you can schedule power
I like about the lockscreen is you can just turn it off or like if you're using at home have to use a slide or anything you can just turn it on and off
you got the face
unlock a voice unlock
you can use those to unlock your device as well if you want to does give a note that they're less secure than using a pin or password but you do have some different options for that
you can also go in here and increase font size if you wanted to have larger font on the menus here and stuff so some of the other accessibility features in here
you got the text-to-speech
I went ahead
I'll give you a sample of that here in an e-book so you just come in turn on text-to-speech towards evening three large boats with livestock and vegetables and there's some agreed-upon for the ransom of the
you got magnification gestures
all right
so here's the quadrant
GPS it's the real GPS so it doesn't just work when you have Wi-Fi you can have Wi-Fi disconnected and still works so some of the other things I wanted to talk about so like I said the screen is really nice
he usually screens that
Android tablets pretty much
the screen is too bright for me at low brightness so I always use the screen filter app to get it even darker for reading at night and stuff like that so otherwise the screen is quite nice
I mean everything
just check the
tap the Frog HD
that racing game
let's see here
Books not all apps have a two column like the Kindle app doesn't for PDFs it does read books for some reason when IPS but anyway so like one of the difference
same amount at the top of the screen so it effectively takes the 8 inch screen or the 10 inch screen to about an 8 inch screen so with tablets like the iPad with the 4:3 ratio screens
like our saying so you may need to use do may just sort of depends on your eyesight but I have no problem reading it like that personally so then what the Kindle app for instance
that play
whatsapp doesn't it doesn't have the two column mode like I was saying when you're using PDFs but it does for e-books then yeah like I was saying they just gave a little bit differently than like on a 4:3 tablet screen
so it's not quite as large but it's still easily readable in my opinion but it just sort of depends on what your preference is and how the PDFs are laid out so I noticed in the past for viewing other tablets the Zinio app can bog down some devices pretty easily on Android but I don't have any problems with this tablet that it runs nice and smooth for the most part
maybe just a tiny quarter of an inch at the bottom of the screen here and you've got really nice color so obviously larger tablet like this is going to be really nice for reading comics
good afternoon everybody madam
I know it's a little bit late but as I've stated in a few of my vlogs we've been having some issues around the house the last week we've had to replace our entire HVAC unit and our water heater so spices to say the house has been a total mess
I don't use
it is model
in this
basic photo needs
but once again
it has a 17.5
watt hour battery
it's fairly basic
you do get this wall charger with a detachable USB cable so you can basically plug this into your computer and the other end is just your standard micro USB connector which goes into the tablet here and you can transfer your data music stuff like that so you can hook this up to your computer very easily comes with just your most basic basically instruction book which I haven't even opened yet basically what's in here
see what this is
Birds Netflix YouTube
I mean I can you would think with one gigabyte of RAM you would see a little bit of lag but you really don't get any lag whatsoever and I'll just go ahead and start one of my videos here
I'm still I still only have 26% left but once again the the quad core processor definitely makes up for the lack of RAM that this particular tablet has see
this is 4121 millivolts
I get two days of moderate use out of this before I actually have to charge the battery up and right now Singh at 83% and I actually haven't charged this since yesterday
temperatures are decent you 30s to maybe low 40s which is degrees Celsius which is very common for these anything under 45 or 50 degrees Celsius is considered normal when it comes to tablets
alright so now that
basically up and down
it's sad the one
I have in here
and then the Acer logo there and the bottom right here is the built-in speaker now a little funny story about the speaker the first two of these tablets that I picked up had a problem with the speaker they actually had a short in it to where if I was playing music or something or anything had audio you would only hear the audio every once in a while I'd actually have to do was put pressure on the speaker itself to get it to play at all so there was obviously some type of short probably a bad solder joint so I don't know if that was just the batch just the batch that they got but that's something you definitely want to look out for luckily third time's the charm and this one actually worked flawlessly so this is my review of the Acer Iconia 8 tablet
I actually haven't had the opportunity to use one if you want to check out the whole of hurons range and other product make sure to check out the link in the description or go to Hue uncom so as I mentioned today I'll be reviewing the GT 220 which is actually the largest interactive pen display tablet and when we were sorting out the particulars with Huron of getting the device sent over
coupon code for you guys so that anyone watching this review who was interested in the product would have a chance to get five percent off of their already low price
so don't say
May 2017 specifically six months from the launch of this video so before I even received the device I had an initial impression and that is quite simply that this pen display tablet is double the size at almost half the price of the first-ever interactive pen display tablet
I owned when I was 16 years old so that probably says quite a lot as to the industry as a whole in the fact that technology is becoming more accessible powerful and affordable which is awesome so with your on tablet affordability and accessibility bringing things such a long way
stand up so
there are a few fun little surprises that were quite pleasant along the way one of which was the fact that the shipping box was sent out with wood packed on either side so that my box wouldn't get crushed or damaged in transit and then inside the box everything was really well packed and protected if you get the device though just make sure to take it out of the box vertically rather than tipping it out upside down because that didn't work well for me
I didn't quite understand at first until I realized that the monitor can be mounted on other stands and mounts so once again going to my first ever tablet again six years ago
where you pull the stand into a horizontal and more vertical position but in this case if you wanted to ditch the default mounting for say an arm mount or a swing mount or something like that
which is great
I live in the future like their website has all the up-to-date drivers anyway from the time I received and opened the Box to the time I had it all set up and ready to go
it only took about the space of five minutes which is great and really uninhibited me to move forward and create some artwork so jumping into some details about this product it features a full HD IPS panel at 1080p with 178 degrees wide viewing angle
it's also worth noting that this is the v2 or second version of the GT 220 the second generation has improved performance overall from the old one along with the newly designed pen with slightly different grip and appearance from the old one
it boasts accurate cursor positioning 2048 levels of pressure pad sensitivity and an adjustable stand which can be set to different angles because the stand mechanism was something that I had experienced in other devices before it was really easy to get used to and wasn't cumbersome sitting in a nice balance between functional but unintrusive so as far as user experience goes I used the tablet for 2 days full time and worked on some client work and the experience was perfectly comfortable
held me back drastically
I have jumped onto other people's tablets usually pad tablets or other tablets where I need to adjust slightly to the user experience and there has been a bit of a jarring window of sort of relearning how to use that specific device
if at all to be honest with the gt2 20 my overall experience was great and I finished all the work I needed to do in the time I had to do it and I tend to work at a pretty hefty pace and work heavy handedly so it handled everything I threw at it
I only have two small qualms in the use of the tablet that I would suggest keeping in mind if you're interested in purchasing the product one is that at the time that I was using the device
I was a little jarred by at first more in that mental barrier but I got used to at no time the assumption being of course that there's a slight compromise to accuracy when you're pressing the pen twice on the screen as opposed to just holding it in position and pressing one button once to get a double click happening so it's absolutely not the end of the world and something that is easily worked around but also something that could be fixed and I would suggest to hurry on to perhaps add in a future driver update as an option for one of those buttons functions
the other thing
I was slightly concerned about was that there was a little bit of give when extra pressure was added to a side or corner of the device and I didn't know how that would affect workflow and to be honest most times when I see people using a digital display pen tablet they draw quite lightly and aren't pressing firmly with that palm on the tablet but I personally am very heavy-handed so I didn't know if that would be a problem but I found in my several days using the tablet that in reality the only times I'm going to the sides and corners of the device are to select menus or options and in those situations my hand naturally was lifted off of the display
quite a bit so
I actually didn't in practice experience any problems with that overall though I found the tablet looked great felt great and was aesthetically pleasing and completely functionally more than capable so now let's talk Turkey right when you're considering buying a device like this you tend to balance the ratio of performance to price to sort of figure out what you're getting and if you're getting the bang for your buck so here's what it comes down to
my answer is absolutely
because when people want an affordable product sometimes they run the risk of or fear receiving something that feels cheap and this is probably the reason why a lot of people have asked me about here on tablets and my impression of them because they're very affordable and you don't want to end up getting a bad experience for the money that you're putting out there so all
I needed to achieve and work on and it was completely comfortable and pleasant to use as well so I would by extension assume that the device is up to handling more advanced and professional use cases
it's a large screen size which is really comfortable and immersive enough to pull you into it without feeling like you're drawing on a teeny tiny screen but another thing
that's temporary so only for the next six months from the launch of this video you can get five percent off of the GT 220 so anyone interested in getting a tablet or upgrading from a pad tablet setup
this is definitely great
I'll see you later

I'll see you later
I got my four-year-old a little leapfrog tablet in my 20 month old basically had a meltdown so I was looking for something cheap for her to play with - this is the cheapest
I would have rather have spent about 20 but this is me I guess tapi low-tech kid so9 so I was really just looking for something that a you know 20 month old could just finger mash and just you know play along with her sister and really not do much so this is pretty cool
oh that's my daughter
I do like that
these are the game
are there demos
I'm not sure so
anyway for 40 bucks
but for somebody under two or even from two to three that has an attention span of you know just a couple minutes and they just want to play around and tinker with stuff
know a baby long road trips or if you just want to keep them entertained with some fun little learning games for a few minutes this is you know this is perfect
so that's nothing super fancy but perfect for you know a little baby that just really wants to finger mash something and have fun and just kind of work no
I'm pretty cool
yeah that's about it
you know it plugs in goes to usb and they give you the usb cable usb to micro usb and of course they give you the tablet itself now the screen is dirty in full disclosure
i did open this up and set it up already because otherwise you're just going to be watching me run through the same android setup that anybody would be going through so now let me show you some more of the features of the unit
of course they give you a micro sd card slot can take up to 128 gig card and the micro usb port right there on the back over here at the bottom
it has dual wi-fi 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz a quad-core processor and it has a 5-hour battery life that's when you're playing video otherwise if you're doing music you can get like 50 hours out of the battery so battery
the front camera is 2 megapixels and the back camera is 8 megapixels and for video will record up to 720p so with that out of the way we'll go ahead and turn it on
so um anything in here that is on android so if you have an android phone or an android tablet already especially if you have that back up to the cloud
it's called tune blast
uh then you know
um you know you can set your notifications up different notification sounds when for it to dim the screen and shut it off due to non-use all that kind of stuff is there
so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to switch over to the cameras that are on this and i'll take some still pictures using the front camera and the back camera and also some video using the front and back camera and then we'll go ahead and wrap this up
it supports 720p
inch tablet now
it feels sturdy
that makes it absolutely fantastic but by the same token being that everything with it is adequate it will do therefore an adequate job in any task you throw at it in my eyes
there's really no need to go and spend the money on a expensive name brand like a samsung or an asus or an acer tablet or one of those big names out there quite honestly
thanks for watching
I'm back again today
this tablet is an Android based device running the Android 5.1 operating system and it features a lot of Disney Pixar and Marvel characters and themes which is pretty freakin awesome
if you're a kid there's no shortage of reasons to like the smart tab but let's start off with a quick rundown of some of its key features and specs first of all
it's got a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core processor along with 1 gigabyte of RAM it's also got 8 gigabytes of internal storage space along with a building micro SD card reader with a total max capacity of 64 gigabytes in terms of its screen
it can also play three different types of video files including mp4 and it has full front and rear facing cameras and features two different wireless connectivity options including Bluetooth 4.0 and integrated 802 point 11 b/g/n Wi-Fi a 3000 mAh built-in rechargeable battery provides up to 7 hours of play time and it's included charging cord and adapter allow you to charge it through any AC outlet however the cord actually plugs into the adapter via a standard USB connector
it's soft flexible
one of those things is the fact that it can be used just like any other tablet so for checking email or web surfing or whatever so to my way of thinking
it's actually almost as much fun for adults as it is for kids but where it really excels is in what is called its child mode for which you can set a special password that your child will need to know in order to exit that mode
so for that one
that are audibly narrated
you get the idea
I really enjoyed myself
that's probably my only complaint of the smart tab that it doesn't include a stylus but overall that's a relatively minor complaint now my favorite thing about the smart tab is probably the arcade section which features 30 different games and although
I did try a few and really enjoyed them a lot so I kind of saved this part of the discussion here towards the end so that I could revisit it and show you one of the games now
Maul their long tongues out and pick off the dragon bugs and the longer you play the faster those frogs start popping at you so it's really a lot of fun and probably pretty good for coordination and motor skills too in the little one and that's where I'm gonna leave off you know there's a whole lot more
an hour-long video so I'll try to put some extra some different details that say in the written review so if you want to check that out I'll put a link for it down below
take that frog
what's up guys
we go so
this is nice
so we're good
I'm not impressed
I don't like it
I I have other artworks online and and I can do better but I'm not feeling it with this tablet and I feel like I just can't draw with it at all
I feel like I would rather have one of those things in this big thing here because you know it just has more control it has a tilt control and I know this has like a lot of pressure sensitivity but I just don't like it get to push down too hard I don't feel that loose freedom and I'm not seeing any pretty lines so and also I made a video a few months ago about how to draw Dante DMC
we are checking out matrix pad z1 and android tablet by venkio which come with a competitive price makes it suitable for kids and have a very fantastic features as well starting with the 7-inch ips screen with the resolution of a 600 by 1024
so they can install plenty of videos on their micro sd cards as well this similar specification with the copper certified especially for toddlers and little kids is also available from the same manufacturer
i will drop a link for that in the video description if you're interested in that as well but all the specifications and whatever is running in it is exactly the same now
and let's not forget one more important factor in here as well tablet also come with the built-in gps that means you can use it in your car as a satellite navigator
one multi-language supporting user guide explaining each and everything about the tablet and one detailed startup guide explaining how the connections and everything you can access within the tablet one micro usb charging cable and a power adapter now in last but not least the mattress pad z1
no problem whatsoever
tablet is also equipped with the front as well as a rear two megapixel camera rocker switch for volume up and down and power on and off button over the top right hand side and right on the top ledge of the tablet you're going to access a 3.5
mm auxiliary port for connecting your earplugs micro sd card slot which can go up to 128 gigabytes and a usb port for charging your tablet and on the back of tablet
finish as well so it's less prone towards getting any dust marks at all there is also a factory restore pin available just under the power button a single output speaker and a microphone for two-way audio communication in the front lcd
gigahertz now once connected tablet will going to check for any updates available and ask you for google credentials if you don't have them create one or if you already have them just log in with them simple as that
you can download thousands of application and install it on your tablet if you want to now if you would like to make this tablet a child friendly what you gotta do is install the parental account on the tablet
so in case your child wanted to install any application or change anything on the tablet you will get to notify it and you have to acknowledge it as well now let me show you all predefined application which are installed on this tablet
calendar camera application
when you're using this tablet for the youtube videos i had to turn off the lights to show you the right display in front of you and you can see that is pretty much clear and the output of the speaker isn't that bad at all seems to be pretty good to be honest with you and in terms of resolution the maximum
it is a 480p
which honestly speaking
you can use it to take photos or video recordings if you want to come with the front as well as the rear camera so you can also install the video chatting softwares like a skype or zoom to enjoy your communication with the front camera response where i am recording
so you can use google maps as well for satellite navigation if you want to or you can install other applications like a ways to use this tablet as a satellite navigator within your car
i do not want you to do any kind of benchmark test on it because guys it's a very competitive price a cheap tablet which come with one gigabytes of ram simple is that a quad-core cpu
which will play a lot of games for sure but one gig of ram kind of a decent for the little ones actually or if you just wanted to use it for the media purposes because anything you play on it it will have a less resolution but going to look an awesome on the display for sure because this plays very little so you're not going to see any defects in a video at all honestly speaking the price you are paying for that you are getting what you expect from it
i would be happy to help and i try to show each and everything what this tablet can do for you so on that note guys thank you again for watching
I'm going to be unboxing and reviewing the huion GT 221 pro the difference of course being that this is the 220 V 2 and this is the 221 Pro
you get it kids
the second is
I'm going to sit down knuckle down and create some art with this thing for four or five hours and film throughout the process and get some b-roll and in that process
which is that's incredible
a discounts aside here on has the reputation for having the most bang for your buck when it comes to digital tablets and that definitely was true for the 220v 2 and
now remember kids
this is fragile
I'm in the dull
I loved working with them as a sponsor but on their socials and just in general they make themselves really available and communicative which I just think is fantastic and exceptional
it comes with a screwdriver and literally everything you need to get set up which i think is really cool so you take off the static free packaging and this is what this looks like
let's not look perfect
oh bloody idiots
but we're not gonna be able to play around with it until we get it set up so I'm just gonna put the screen over here and go through some of these little bits and bobs here now
at the back that you pull and the legs retract so that way you can lean the screen forwards and backwards like that so we're going to attach that but let's first open the instructions
where are they
this looks instructional
step one do this
I think I'm done
that was two steps
I'm done so
this is the device and we have the pen and this time we get a pen case which is very cool including the new huion pen which has over 8,000 levels of pressure sensitivity which
I've got a gift
that's it cuz
this is a gift
is this another pin
because let's say you have this thing set up at your home studio and you have your home studio pen you can also in theory have an on-the-go pen packed in a bag
I'm going to set this baby up and run it my laptop using the HDMI cable and I'm just gonna knuckle down and play around with this thing after I install the drivers and we're going to talk about my experience after that first part of setting up is pretty self-explanatory USB goes to USB HDMI goes to HDMI and power goes to power
because you were making a gag for a video and pray to the gods above that there is a downloadable Driver online which of course there is just go to the huion comm website and find that the product that you have and you can just go to the product page and scroll down to the bottom by the way I noticed that there was the handy jazzer coupon code there for 5% off now only available for a little time
click on the Downloads
it should be mentioned by the way another little bonus that I noticed while setting up is that there is this little hole in the back of the monitor casing which is the perfect size for a pen and I'm just assuming that it's a pen holder
so that's really cool
then the fact that when you set up you can just pull the pen out put it and your smudge guard and get to work and when you're finished you can just pack up your setup and pop your pen back
I recommend making a few personal tweaks first of all you want to adjust to the proper shortcuts that you want to move particularly for the stylus and the little buttons that you can use to make it right
click and the middle
the default pressure sensitivity wasn't ideal for myself because as I tend to be quite heavy-handed and I like the lines to appear straight away when I go really soft as you can see from the example shown here I go through a bunch of the different pressure sensitivity settings the top squiggly line being a very tight pressure sensitivity setting where you have to push quite hard to get a strong line all the way down to the bottom squiggly line which really doesn't take much pressure at all to get a solid line
it turns out
a nice loose but still responsive pressure sensitivity that makes the most out of the huge levels of pressure sensitivity in the tablet and fits my style of drawing so first things first
Photoshop brushes inside Photoshop and started playing around and I wanted to start off simple before I dive into it just to sort of get a grip of the device and see how it handled things starting off with a bit of a simple jazzy avatar variation
you may recognize him from the thumbnail the reason I wanted to go through this method is because there are three distinct ways of working that I sort of go through starting off with a bit of a sketch using my construction pencil brush then I go through line work with some really smooth and crisp line weight variation really focusing on the pressure sensitivity as a feature of this device which really handled extremely well then last but not least we get into coloring which also works into the precision side of things and also how it works around the program as a whole navigating between layers working and navigating between various features in Photoshop such as clipping masks and various selection methods
it really felt like
I had the power of a desktop PC with a really high-end tablet under my fingertips which was just fantastic moving on I wanted to create a really detailed and painterly style piece using my different painting
brushes which is a nice way to sort of familiarize myself with how I can go through a more elongated workflow something that I might spend several hours working on this would be cool because I could start off really rough and really sketchy working very quickly and more and more moving towards precision finer details have been working in features of tweaks and nips and tucks to finalize the piece
I'm going to take you through some of the fine features of this device starting off with the resolution at a full HD 1920 by 1080 P resolution the device features anti glare glass which I did find quite useful in particular in this situation because I was filming in a brightly lit studio with lots of very bright lights
so while it's not a feature that usually catches my attention when I'm looking at a product it's interesting how that came in useful and I can see how that would be useful if you have a working space with bright natural light or large windows around the device boasts wide viewing angle the IPS panel and 178 degree wide viewing angle offer a consistent image appearance so high definition and better color accuracy from whatever angle
the device is compatible of course with Mac and PC which is really nice to know as well and the open design features the new PE 330 digital pen which has 8,192 levels of pressure sensitivity which I definitely noticed and will go into later in this review
I found the stand to be a little weaker than I would like around the edges however with this device which I'll get into later and show you what I mean the builds felt much sturdier even though I had a very similar stand setup which is surprising given that the body of the device is bigger although it's actually lighter than the other device but that's another topic that's basically it for all of the major specifications of the device as far as what you get in the box
that surprised me
it's quite a silk and has two fingers which I got used to very quickly and was very comfortable and I also loved the fact that they throw in a free pen just a fantastic bonus but I think with all
and as you can see present to both of the art and the workspace in a really effective way it proved to be a really aesthetically powerful device and extremely practical so now we arrived to the part of the video where
by having one of these buttons be a single click or a left click and of course the tablet itself is a left click so by pressing that and then tapping sort of access is double click but I feel like it adds a micro step
I found it
so if you have a task bar down there hitting the little windows icon has sometimes been a little bit hit-and-miss but when you get used to that you can sort of slow down your motion and find it when you go to hit it
this is me trying to be as upfront and nitpicky as possible just to share how my experience has been with you without anything being held back but to be completely honest
it's hard to do better in fact you actually can't get a better bigger tablet with this level of pressure sensitivity and as affordable as it is and even what its lucky
those of you who watched my last review may remember there was a slight wobble when I pushed on the top corners and it wasn't that noticeable in use but it didn't make the device or the stand at least feel somewhat flimsy that didn't feel present at all on this tablet which is surprising given that it's bigger and the stand itself isn't necessarily bigger so
I'm not a touch trip or shortcut-keys kind of guy and I did spend the first 15 minutes of calibrating and setting up the tablet to maybe find some keys that I thought could work but I've tried to do that with every tablet
I've used that has shortcut keys and always found them less convenient than just having a keyboard on my lab but that's just my experience and I know people who do rely on those shortcut keys and the fact that they are present in this device and not in the previous model is definitely a huge bonus for a lot of people
you have the the bulk of the cake the the guts of it that hold it all up in the structure and it's the cake and then you have the garnishing as the dressings and the things that make it pretty the cherry on top so to speak the cake in this case is the size and professionalism of the tablet which let me just say is delicious
I created the painting
that's just the best
that's the cake
and the bottom corner
they're things where
I really like cake
the overall experience that comes with this device is overwhelmingly positive and I can absolutely highly recommend it both to professionals and to people who want to enter the spectrum of digital display tablets with a nice big display without breaking the bank this is Hugh owns biggest display tablet product and display
I personally love a nice big tablet but also some people can get picky and not like when they feel a bit clunky or too big and this I believe doesn't cross into that territory but will definitely satisfy people who need that larger working space like I prefer but also feel compact and slim enough that people who are used to a smaller form factor won't be overwhelmed some of the extra goodies that they send like the smudge guard and the extra pen are really welcome additions and add to the value of the experience and also occurred to me that if you were to for example run out of charge on a pen having a backup and charged means you can simply swap them and keep the other one charging while you just continue to work seamlessly even though of course you can work with the charging cable plugged in
you can get an affordable large form factor tablet that really can deliver in the long term anyways that brings me to the end of my unboxing and short view of the GT 221 Pro
it's fantastic device and if you're interested in it once again the coupon code and the links to getting five percent off of this device for yourself if you want an abbot are in the description that's only available for a limited time so make sure to snap that up while you can in the next few months otherwise

I'll see you later
I sell ebooks
hi guys today
um here's a mat
um you're drying gloves
you're traveling buggy
it's a nice chocolate
i don't know which one um you have a bar with some extra accessories such as extra nibs and converters so we have a case for your pen to protect it and it's really nice and whatever what this one is
just one wire you know and it's usb type-c to um usb um 3.0 and we have our manual so it's a pretty simple setup right we have some sharper keys a nice scroll wheel very minimal in design
it's very
i'm gonna do a a little speed pain so you guys can see how well it works with um photoshop and just to see what you can create it so i do hope you guys enjoy remember to like this video
you know so but after that phase it felt more natural so um there's a bit of learning curve with this tablet in terms of eye to screen coordination right so but it does offer a very comfortable enjoying experience so currently the tablet is for 89.99 usd and i believe it will be on sale soon in terms of price
um it's very
i must say though
if you're new
mind the background
it smells like paint so um also you can like take this out and it can be like um oh wait you can put it like that and put this down
oh my gosh
she's so cute though
hit the hold it
okay now
i'm guessing it's calendar
whatever that is
there's all these apps
nope that's contacts
so yeah bye
box calm today
this is the box
is that items included
so it's not Wireless
that's the neat remover
there is no pen
stand the m10 six
quality is quite solid the build quality is actually not very different compared to we on XP pen Pablo or even welcome for large rubber strips behind and the working area is 10 by 6 inches
turn and if you are left-handed user you can turn that habit here 180 degrees so that physical shortcut buttons go to the right side and that's all there is for the tablet driver this is photoshop cs5 on
Mac I wasn't able to test this on Windows so I cannot tell you how it performs on Windows but here on the Mac what a shop looks very well the pressure sensitivity is very good
when you draw a line is like this sometimes the lines they can appear to be a bit angular but this this is very smooth so this is great and this is also very responsive
Photoshop is fantastic
it's very irritating
so this is unusable
illustrator cs5
it works very well
pressure works very nicely
just that when
this is mischeif pressure
the lines how thick they are they are actually determined mostly by the styles of these two so you can affect it somewhat but ultimately they are still dictated by the tools so let me try and draw some thin lines you can see the taper thick
so pressure definitely works here quite well overall the graphic software that I have tested on the Mac they generally work quite well with the exception of Adobe Illustrator version cs5
they say that newer versions of Illustrator should work fine but I have no way to test that anyway if you have experience with using illustrator newer versions or if you use Windows we've just had that I would love to hear from your experience
build quality is quite solid the only downside for me would be the surface is a bit too smooth so I wish there was just a little bit more friction to make it less slippery but for drawing performance the strokes in the graphic software
thanks for watching hope
this is helpful
obviously subscribe all that
which is one that
now this is not a sponsor of you but they did provide the tablet but all of the opinions here about this tablet are mine and mine alone but first let's switch over to a little bit of an unboxing
open it up once
I'm done with that
actually around the back
obviously this is getting sped up so you can't hear what I'm saying but I'm basically reading off some of the specs but don't worry those will get read off in a little bit near the end actually and as soon as we open it up you get the nice little foam that they use to protect the screen during shipment which I really like first thing you see obviously is the tablet so we'll move out of the way first thing we pick up is of course the pen itself depends really nice
it's very light as I've come to expect for these battery lists type of pens that you don't have to recharge and that's just me checking if you have to
you know charge it
you don't next
this is just so that if for some reason you don't have a USB type 3 on your which would give power to the tablet this latch empowered it through the wall
the red one is what you would use the adapter on if you had to this little thing is what plugs into the actual tablet it plugs into the USB cable as well which you'll see right here it's the little one little adapter or if you have a little HDMI cable which is lovely to have of course and now that we're done with the unboxing let's go on and do some of it like you know tests that
I usually do so
I'm doing that
IPS screen six customizable
Express keys on it as well as full 8192 pressure levels and a 75% Adobe RGB color gamut the tablet supports both Windows and Mac and works with a plethora of software
so good job on art easel for getting that sorted the Express Keys feel really good and the dial wheel is comfortable to use and even is a button itself that lets you switch
I'll be doing a test stream on Wednesday to show the tab Adolphe more in practical use so be sure to stop by for that or watch the recorded stream after it's finished by subscribing to the channel so yeah all in all
if not don't worry
I'll make sure to ask them for some links that you guys can use to go and buy them but anyway thank you guys so much for watching as always you can check the description for my skills share classes
make sure you subscribe
also make sure you check the community tab of my channel for any posts that I make as well as on Twitter as I'm trying to use Twitter a little bit more often
alright see you soon
there's no protruding buttons
anything on the outside for kids to break and you get a USB cord now the USB is a mini USB so you just plug it into the sides hoping you can see that and then when it's on you've got a green light that means you're good to go other things in the box are some different inspiration papers
I call them
it's very simple
press it once for the lowest setting twice for the medium three times for the brightest and then again we'll turn it off what I'm going to show you first is how to help me use the inspiration papers that came so to turn so what you'll need is you'll need to pick some papers
we place our design over the top and then we can turn our light pad on the way that you thought all that you then need to do is get your piece of paper whether it's drawing paper or not and place it over the top
then what you then can do is come in and trace over your design and then when you turn the light pad off you will be left with the design now
you can also do that too so if you've already got a dress form in mind you can then turn it off and you'll have the outline of your dress so you can get as detailed as you like there another way to use it is to use it for lettering so
I'm terrible at lettering so what I've done here is I've printed out the words that I want to write and so you can imagine the same thing if your child is not quite writing yet
which is a removable rice paper tape and place it just on the edges there and that will stop your underneath page from moving so we've taped down what we're wanting to coffee and we have our drawing that we want to place this writing into so all we need to do is so yeah like
nice and straight and then you can use the light pad to help position your drawing over the top and then go in and you can then use the light pad to trace over the wording and it will be in the font that you've chosen so nice and simple it keeps everything on a straight line because that's another thing
I'm terrible at and it means that the kids have a little bit more autonomy in regards to their drawings so they're able to have nice neat writing you don't have to sit there and hold their hand and they can just trace and coffee so that's another way and then the reason that I use rice paper here
that has what looks to be a star on the front what I would do is place that star down flat on your pay and turn your light pod on then you have a piece here almost
it's a bit like tracing paper itself which have all sorts of pieces of the mandala that if you can imagine them all collected in a circle would make something similar to this
Pat on like that
that are here
what you are then going to do is make a small adjustment to your paper and to the tracing paper and you're going to copy you're going to slide them over around the circle a little bit further and then you're going to trace again and you're going to continue that until you have a full circle now within these blank pieces you can either leave them blank or that you can add any of the elements of a mandala
so your dots
your spirals your drops
so we've copied that what we then do is take our paper away and then move our tracing paper around to the next slice of the star we then return our paper but keeping our first piece of our mendala within that first slice of the star and then we continue along and as you can see very soon you will get the start of a mandala shape
so that's how you do it with the light tracing pad and I'm not sure if my friend yaar it can speed the video up but hopefully it was like an excellent so I'll go ahead and finish this and then you can see what it will look like at the end okay
I've missed a little gap here but you can continue all the way around the other thing that you can do is if you've made a little change there and you can use the parts of the mandala to make a flower
that's good about this
so it's quite thick but as you can see you can still see through to whatever is coming through underneath so if this was going to be for a watercolor you would still only use light
I'm doing it slightly darker just so that you can see what I'm doing but using the form underneath almost like a grid so that I can keep consistent with everything that I'm doing so you always want to center point with your mandala then you can use
and you can use the lightbulb to very easily ensure that you're placing them all in the correct space so what you're wanting to do is just continue your way around now
place the center point back in the middle and I can continue working on it now the last I know I said this was the last one but I forgot one little thing to show you and that's layering so I don't have another piece of paper to show you
layering is a really basic way of adding simple shapes together to make your end result so this is a painting that I had done of a little wolf on a cliff and I want to place it so that the wolf is sitting and howling to the moon
thank you your egg
I'm not going to be looking at the star in this situation but I will turn my light pad on and then I will place my my little wolfy painting into there then
place it over the top and I can see all the elements that I need so I will trace my moon oops it's a bit wonky now and then I can then go in and trace through there my little Wolfie I think yarek knows a little Wolfie I do
oh all the time
you can't stop it
it's not good
then you can come in with your coloring in pencils and color them in you can even come in and paint over the top with watercolor if you want to
thank you star range
what I like about having an Android tablet is that if you have a Google account all the apps you have on your smartphone automatically get downloaded onto the tablet
you can see that
it's pretty quick very responsive it also has a really nice home button here to get thank you back and then these will stay on the bottom gonna actually change out these apps on the bottom here but they'll stay wherever whatever paid you go on so
you have task manager
it's really responsive
it says we ate a 10 hour battery life but I have the the screen set to full brightness display here so I have it all the way up to the full brightness you can lower the brightness down pick when you get it
I put mine in 10 minutes so I doubt I'll get more than five hours in the battery life with the screen at full brightness and not sleeping until 10 minutes of non-use the sound quality is excellent
here's one YouTube videos
pull up a photo here to see the good quality of the screen it also records video at 1080 and it's got a 5 megapixel camera it also has a front camera for Skype and other video chat
a memory here comes a 16 built in can also buy the version with 32 built in but if you have an expansion for memory probably don't need that also has a cable for a USB connection and it has headphone jacks on this side here along with the volume button and what I like about these cases is that I can when you close it
it turns it back on so it's good to have that feature especially we're going to leave it on without sleeping for 10 minutes all in all for the cost of the unit
in a world where artists struggle to make the perfect stroke where pens are made out of sticks and tinfoil where there is such thing as finger burn one animator is here to save the day and your fingers
i wish captain doozy would come and give me a brand new tablet have no fear for i am here together with xv pen we can make your dreams come true presenting the cutest range of xp pen the xv pen line friends edition
i'll show you how cool these products are and i'll be showing you how i create my backgrounds for my upcoming video first up the cutest of them all also the smallest in this collection the star g64 tt in this box
that's not a sticker it's printed on there so it's flushed with the tablet so it's not gonna affect your strokes when you draw the best thing about this tablet is how thin and lightweight it is
it's just two millimeters thin so you can just bring it anywhere you can be like the guy that draws people on subways but digitally it also comes with a free translucent frosted protective film so if you want the paper-like rough feeling like that of a sketchbook you can stick it on top and you're good to go
g640 is the p01
it has 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity and two buttons and it also comes with a lot of extra nibs usually to get tablets as small as this you have to sacrifice the quality of the pen and most of them are as if they were just made for taking signatures and presenting stuff
but with this you'll get a great pen with great pressure sensitivity perfect for traveling artists and beginners who want the best experience for the size and budget and then the cutie goodies
look at this stuff
isn't it neat
sketch and line art for my videos long ago i was still experimenting on what my style was resulting in a lot of inconsistencies with my art style i made a lot of ugly teensies
then i position my character where i want them to be in the frame so i can use them as a reference for the sizes of the stuff around then time to sketch to be honest
i was expecting to have a bit of a learning curve drawing on such a small area especially coming from this giant of a pen display but it was actually easier because i didn't have to move as much
i think why this works better for me is because i just draw with my hand touching the tablet so i have very limited movements available that means i can draw a long stroke with one quick movement instead of dragging my arms around plus it fits on the armrest of our couch back to my background as much as i want to tell myself
don't overdo it
i can't help it
you know this will actually be great when face-to-face school starts again you can bring this to school and brag about your digital art skills or draw your teacher for fun
just kidding
that are customizable
it's also super thin
the box is the pen which also has 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity and this one supports tilt up to 60 degrees which i think is what makes it a better choice
it also includes a stretchy drawing glove usbc cable and two usb adapters for different devices which you can use on your phone and also it's perfect for mac users like myself and like others in the xp pen family
then i change the colors to what i want it to be by the way this can also be used with your phone so the finger drawers out there who would love to upgrade and finally have a pen with white space to draw on
this is for you
perfect for artists who prefer wide enough space to work on having tilt sensitivity and can still be portable and last but not the least this is the artist 12 pro for people like me who prefer to use pen displays
what's in the box
it's also full hd and has a 178 degree viewing angle and it also has these cute envelope sprints on top cuties they also have this cool pen case with the pen inside and with extra nibs at the other side very classy and apparently you can also use this as a pen holder
look i prefer bigger displays when i'm animating because i have a lot of windows open but whenever we travel i end up using my ipad and use the sidecar on the macbook
the feel of it is very like my wacom cintiq maybe because of it being laminated and having a similar texture making it super easy to control your strokes so this is the best one for you if you want the pen display on the budget with great great quality and ta-da it's done so you saw me using the star g640 the deco 0-1 version 2 and the artist 12 pro
that means
i will also include stickers postcards and love letters from me and herrick's so how to join the contest whatever medium you prefer create an artwork in the theme of friendship and love 2021 send your entry to toonsie xppen giveaway at gmail.com tell us something about you
and if you do post it on instagram or stories you can tag xv pen however i will only select the winners from those who sent their submissions to the email i mentioned posting them on instagram will just allow me to repost it on my story
good luck guys
but- Aaah! [PANTING] Milo!
Look at this artwork!
No, usually I start with an unboxing video but I feel like packaging is generally the same and I got kind of excited, and so I unboxed it already and this is- Here is the XP-Pen 22R Pro.
I reviewed last year.
But you know what?
My last XP-Pen review I had a critique about them having way too many wires. Thankfully they improved and implemented a USB-C, it's one wire and let's hook this up. Oh snap!
Right when you plug it in it seems like it works right away, it looks crisp, but maybe you don't have USB-C and it's totally okay, there's an HDMI cable inside the box for you.
I recently reviewed.
To be honest, I think they both look great, 1-2% isn't gonna make much of a difference but if you want to get down to the nitty-gritty, like, "Which one is 1% better?"
there you go.
you can get!
I'm like, ggurhgr!
with- oh wow!
Let's try another one.
Ah that's gorgeous!
I really like it.
is that a thing?
Bright midnight?
that's right for you.
You see that?
Oooh! Arcane magic!
Oh look at that.
And now it's dark!
Let's do it!
Read their return policy
Don't, don't fall!
two: answer this question!
right now, right.
retrorocket disk hey
it is multimode
it's got four gig
do not buy one
that has four gigs
touchscreen is really
I'm not going to be hating on it but I just want you to know that if you have a choice here between two gigs and a touchscreen I mean between four gigs in a touchscreen
you take the more
and don't close with that because you don't really use the touchscreen that much on this it's just not a thing all right so rant aside it also has a dual core
I'm showing right now
now that's said it does have a rubberized surface on the top like just a little edge around the top of the keyboard not the keyboard itself but the keyboard platform the deck that allows it to rest comfortably on a table without skidding around
there's also ten mode
the hinge rotates fully
don't even mess with it just upgrade to Windows 10 because it has a much neater way of supporting the tablet mode in that basically you can use it as a regular Windows 10 laptop when when you're just using it with the keyboard like this and then when you switch over here it well wait
I'm going to login
we go now
it's it looks a lot like Windows 8 when it's like that but it's made for touchscreen at this point it's the interface is separate touchscreen which is really pretty nifty that works really well in
that's pretty cool
alright so how was
somebody's been embezzling
wise it's okay
I had to adjust it out-of-the-box it seemed a little bit reddish to me and I'm pretty sure I'm right about that because I compared it to my other two laptops and the other two looked pretty good and this one looked really reddish so even the recycle bin looked reddish so I did adjust it but it looks really good now
see how flat it is and you do feel that when you're typing and it's not like you get the positive you get the fake positive clicks that you get out of an Apple keyboard
that's this shallow
it's really quite nice
it feels cheap
it looks really nice so yeah fitting fit and polish is kind of a mixed mixed bag as you would expect for my laptop of this price a hard drive
that's on this
maybe you should shell out a little bit and have the technician - a tune-up on it and clean up all the crap we're on it and tell it and tell them specifically that you want them to clean up all the circus where you want it very clean
otherwise it's going to take up a lot of RAM I can't even imagine how this thing that the 2gig version would even run with all the crap that was on here but anyway cleaned it up and now it runs really fast application wise
it's fine casual browsing
it's quite good
it works really well
here's the power button
here's the bad part
let's see USB ports
it's not a mini
that's really nice
it's this square thing
this is really nice
so if you do not want your laptop to flip the screen when you're in tent mode and you want to look at things upside down you can lock it in position and it won't flip so that ins also very nice
hey what's the verdict
Wi-Fi connectivity
the box to de novo 7 paladin just like book like opening you see that other device is the band any known a static put in thickness not very thick
you can see the side that has got a few capsule gives the back menu and the are given on the side the top has all the Penta Beauty areas
mm headset jack
Kindle Fire will almost of the same size when you see from the trend a lot of difference in the screen size 7 inch tablet / target up a charger by pressing the power key for a few seconds is the innotab nose and reading
that are already available
long pressing any widget or app can has been changing the shape the size and even you can remove those apps and there are lot of changes that you can see in the item sandwich from the previous versions
given in the nose around this time the haptic feedback is pretty good when you hit on the HOME key it gives a feedback of a little vibration like some time which has a few features that you can see in the neighborhood of the system as well as in the honeycomb operating system like the right side bottom area where you can see all the shortcuts
unlike the top area where you could see the notification panel hitting on the demand of that area you will see the shortcut about the internet connection and the time and it becomes again
you will see all the settings the test response is pretty good too and this started is a 1 gigahertz processor speed and it has a fight will mb ram along with that and the one we got has a 8gb of internal memory
already given so these are the running apps right now you can kill them to the task killer and with the one gearhart processor we can expect a few apps running all together at once on the background also she can destroy it
this isn't a storage
so adding both of them it would be around 7 g without the case they have given that hcv so overall this is a pretty good time to devise that pretty neat and sleek design
these are mean USB port so let's say quote on I heard is having given along with this and all seven which are the iphones with a different pattern pin and this is the USB connection with the menus baby this is the Quick Start Guide given along with the other device might has come in a Chinese language and there's no English in back still for a user of honeycomb and edgy a broken system
this is a charger travel charger along with the video connection for you can insert the USB and the same can be used for connecting to the computer also for the price of 1 $20
it comes with only the wiper option what she gets a pretty good one to have when you are considering the Ice Cream Sandwich operating system and this being the first double device with the ICS
it would be pretty good packet also you will be coming up with a few other details where you can get along with the usage of this no 7 tablet
keep watching thank you
Lenovo tab a8 and the Lenovo Tab A 10 alright so let's get right into it starting off with the design in both the a8 and a10 feature a pretty simplistic design with some slight curves on the corners and sides
nothing too special
but they feel very solid and well-made and the matte finish on the back does a great job of detracting fingerprints all while giving the tablets a very nice grip making them easy to hold on to
but they're fairly lightweight for their respective sizes making them very easy to carry around and hold onto for long periods of time the bezels around the display are a little large for my liking but they do serve a purpose besides being a nice spot to rest your thumbs
they also house the front-facing speakers that are actually enhanced with Dolby Digital Plus so you actually get a Dolby audio interface built-in for controlling the audio fidelity whether you're listening through headphones or these speakers themselves it's essentially just an equaliser app as far as I can tell but it does make quite a bit of a difference in terms of how loud and fuller everything sounds both tablets with their respective display sizes feature the same resolution at 1280 by 800 which is a rather typical resolution when it comes to more mid-range tablets
MediaTek processor clocked at 1.3 gigahertz with one gigabyte of RAM and 8 or 16 gigs of internal storage on the a8 and 16 or 32 gigs of storage on the a10 with microSD card expansion
they're both running KitKat
I do notice a few hiccups every now and then but nothing that really took away from my overall experience whether these tablets struggle most is in gaming performance more simplistic games play
it also doesn't get any better in low light especially when you don't have a flash to compensate leading to a lot of dark and grainy looking shots and without a variable focus taking clear close-up shots become virtually impossible the a 8 and a 10 compact with some decently sized batteries at 4200 milliamp hours and six thousand three hundred forty million hours respectively and battery
I primarily only use them for gaming and watching videos on YouTube but even with my usage I only managed to get between six to six and a half hours of screen on time on both so it felt a little bit short of what I was expecting
and if you're a lighter more average user you're probably going to get a little bit more out of the battery than I was able to so like I mentioned earlier
but not only
is it running KitKat
that's filled with a lot of very bright and colorful looking icons and this very weird sliding pane that comes out from the left or right edge of the display that gives you access to some recently open apps
if you don't like it there's also no app drawer so your home screens will get cluttered up very quickly if you like to download a lot of apps but this is Android afterall so if you don't like Lenovo zone launcher and want a more standard Android experience just download a different one from the Play Store in problem solved the Lenovo tab a eight and a ten are available now for a price of one seventy nine ninety nine and two forty nine ninety nine respectively and they're both currently on sale through Amazon as of right now if you want to take advantage of that price they both come in Wi-Fi only in 3G models but as far as I can tell the 3G model is either really hard to find or currently not available either way
I think the price is pretty fair for what you're getting and the overall specs are actually very comparable to something like the Galaxy Tab four line of tablets which I reviewed earlier and in some ways
so if you were considering a tablet from the Galaxy Tab four line but the price was a little bit too steep the Lenovo Tab a eight and a ten are certainly great alternatives

today we will see if windows have anything to look for in the market where our dream is absolute rule and did level will make a good balance between price and performance screen
this is very low and it affects sharpness and usability of the screen bezels of the string of 20 millimeters from top and bottom and cell millimeters from the sides in top left corner there is big
there is front-facing camera
port is really good
Lenovo logo is discretely
power and volume buttons
A to Z 37:35 F that is quad-core processor with base frequency clocked at 1.30 3 and turbo up to 1.83 kicker's processor helped to make a bit of cash and it supports up to 2 gigabytes of single channel ddr3 memory and this is exactly what language is built in this tablet processor here horse power to handle everyday office and homework and all the Metro applications in games with like office
we try a dope
Wi-Fi card is from Neotech and it supports up to 54 megabits per second with really strong signal reception by CF bluetooth 4 built-in and microSD card reader four cards up to 64 gigabytes
not for taking pictures
first let's say Microsoft
Google should be scared from dry future and then level did one small but for me huge mistake but not putting edged in my part this could be dream office PC and replace low-end laptops for this price
all right so today
so we've already had the medium and the large but now we have the release of this small and let's pull this out of the box right now and have a look all right
first of all we have the pro pen - and this pen is great it has 9196 levels of pressure sensitivity which is alarm and the nice thing about these pens
is they're just nice
it makes it feel like more like a brush or a pen or a pencil and also the very hole right there is where we actually grab the pen and we can use that to pull the nibs out
it's super long
I hate it when people don't give you long enough cables this side here is USB see and it goes to a regular USB so you can plug that into your laptop and let's take a look at the tablet itself so if we look at the back of it
now it's it's a right-handed which means I can draw on it here and I can use the touch ring and the Express keys here with my left hand as work if you are left-handed flip it the other way in the interface
I love about it is you can unplug the cable and it works perfectly on Bluetooth and so the feeling here just feels very much like a pencil on a piece of paper has a really nice feel
now let's have a look at the sizes here's the large there's the medium and the small and so now the small rounds out the full product line so we've got large medium and small
Express keys and Touch ring they work on Bluetooth wireless and of course the panners battery lists on all of them so when Wacom redesigned this line of tablets our working area actually stayed the same as it did on the previous generation but they shrunk down the edges so the actual footprint on these is smaller so the large even though it's quite large is not actually much bigger than the footprint on the previous medium the medium the footprint is not that much larger than the previous small and the small here is tiny but it still has that same working area which is a lot of good working area here
this thing is small
which means that when
I'm gonna clients locations
your backpack doesn't take up a lot of weight or a lot of space so it's really nice to have that portability but to still have the full features that are on the rest of the tablets
I can press harder to do things or I can tilt to kind of create chiseled edge and do different types of things over there but the other thing is it actually has multi gesture touch so
I can actually use this as a trackpad so I can be drawing here I can be using as a trackpad and then I can be hitting keyboard shortcuts right there so this here is the gist of the tablet
why don't we plug it into the computer right now and put it through his paces and have a look at some of the features that are available right now
I could use the cable and I could plug in with the cable but what I'm going to do is I'm actually just gonna pair it to the Bluetooth and all we need to do to do that is just to tap here and you'll see now
let's click on stop
just choose next
let's choose next now
you might think that's a power switch but that's not actually a power switch there that enables me to turn touch on or touch off so if you're working and you're navigating and everything turn it on but then when you're getting into some real fine detail you don't want to bump anything just pop it off
okay now it's connected
don't work or just a pen just doesn't feel right and that's because you want to make sure that new drivers on there and things should work fine so let's go down here
well simple just plug this into your computer and work off the cable and you can actually be charging while you're working and maybe you're working on the new MacBook Pro and you're thinking oh no what about the USB C connection
well you could just plug this into a portable battery or just plug it into any USB socket charge your tablet and you're good to go and the batteries last a long time alright
we can change some of these set them up and you can also go through and see what set up there and of course we can go in here we can start to set up some of your own just just using two three four or even five finger gestures and you can actually do a lot of things with that then the Pens we go in here we can set up the pen the eraser so that means we can do different things here so we can set up that eraser to work as a keyboard shortcut
with that
we could go to a portion of the tablet here so you could actually go here and just work on this portion here and I know a lot of retouches do that so we click OK and now for me to go all the way across the screen
we're using the whole tablet now and this is our Xpress teeth we can put them on the left right and we can put on top and bottom so if you prefer to work this way you can work like this
we can change them to clicks and you can see there that would be the equivalent of a middle click if you're working in 3d left right click et cetera
means that you move a lot and it only moves a little bit on the screen and that's really useful for when you're doing things like going through menus and you accidentally bump them use precision
you're not gonna have that issue so there's different things we can do with that and in keyboard here we can go in and this is probably the most useful and most common thing here is to give an NSAID a keystroke so maybe I was going to do command Z
it's all reset again
II and that doesn't stay invisible and click ok so now instead of having to do all those I can just set it there and the way I kind of like to sit these up usually is the top three will be things that I do
I set this to pen pressure that means if I draw a light touch I get a thin line as I go harder I can vary the thickness of that line by varying
how much pressure
I tilt that pin
I'm working on images
I can just go in here now and I'm just navigating with two fingers and I can get in here and I can start to do things like let's go down here and I'm just gonna create a new layer since I can pinch to zoom in or out
I'm gonna choose my touch ring and I'm gonna set this to keystroke and now what this enables me to do is hit the left bracket key and hit the right bracket key and I'm just gonna call that one size click OK now when I go in here and I use this notice now
I like to work
is this little padlock
I just drop this down a little bit and I'm gonna make this a 10% opacity and you know I would do kind of dodging and burning now and let's kind of see how this feels with this tablet see
in fact make the brush a little smaller someone to get in here and just okay so this touch ring feels really good for changing my brush size a lot because sometimes when I'm dodging and burning can be a lot of work to change the brush size so see what I'm doing here
so why
don't we flip this around and now we're going to stop painting with white so I'm just gonna drop this down to 10% and I might just put a little highlight along here
just bright a lights here and I don't want to paint them so many times so it's just kind of hitting those areas see that and it's just giving it a little bit more shine now if I really want to make this shine I would get use a hotter edge and that would make it look very reflective almost like it was wet or shiny but I want that I want it to look a little bit more like this not quite so shiny and see what I'm doing here I'm just adding that highlight just where that would be just catching the light
a little bit okay
all right so
there's no lag
it's good pressure
I like about the Wacom technology is I can use a very very light touch and it's still gonna register and that enables you to just shade things more accurately and build things up like you were using a real pencil in the real world so you know right now
I really love it
Wacom or Wacom
let me know in the comments underneath and also let me know in the comments underneath what you guys think about this tablet and also if you love Photoshop and Lightroom consider hitting that subscribe button right now and then you're gonna get a new tutorial from me every single week
in this video
you get one micro
you have a 5 megapixel rear facing camera and the port for the internal speaker when you switch on the s8 for the first time as with any other tablet you must complete the quick setup wizard before you begin to use it
I will also be using am a wireless PC mouse on a micro USB adapter for quick navigation during this demonstration so here to the manufacturer is in car and a model is the s8 it has 2 gigabytes of RAM which is ddr3 memory and it also shows the remainder of the 32 gigabyte of internal storage the Bluetooth version is 4.0 indicated by the 4 plus the Box runs on a quad core to the 2 bit cortex a7 CPU with a Mac CPU clock speed of 1.3 gigahertz with support for only 32-bit
you have single banner
and here it shows
we just saw that
2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi and when connected to a 100 megabits per second internet connection the tablet averaged around 2 D 3 megabits per second you can install Netflix and Amazon Prime video from the Google Play Store and they work however they only show in basic 480p quality
I took some pictures on a video with a rear facing camera and the quality is good for a budget tablet in summary the Vanco metrics piracy is a cool budget tablet that functions well and is a great gift for someone looking for a simple tablet that performs a basic task so if he were interested in the SE see the link provided in the description area
thanks for watching
what's up everybody
it has three gigs of ram 32 gigs of onboard storage bluetooth 5.0 and a 6 000 milliamp hour battery so we're going to go ahead and do some tests
i will also be putting a link in the description in case you guys want to pick it up yourself and if you guys like me and you want to support my channel please use those links because it helps me keep purchasing products to do reviews to you guys so first
okay so first off
stock very simple smooth
so we've pretty much
here's our battery
i haven't charged it
no problems there
i'm going to be doing the unboxing and we're going to be taking a look at some of the brand new features of this phone and compared to the iphone 10r
i will also be doing a video on the iphone 12 pro max as soon as i get that in hand so if you haven't subscribed definitely make sure you do so you know when that video drops but for now it's actually pretty loud especially for just voice as we can see in the quality here we can put it up to 720p
that's the highest resolution that this screen can handle if you're worried about the resolution not looking that good or not gonna be good enough for viewing videos it to me
it looks great
it's pretty smooth
we can't do hd or anything above we can do smooth and balanced and for the frame rate we can do low or medium so we're going to go ahead and start this up and see what it actually looks like so it looks pretty smooth right now
the graphics are okay
they're not the best but it's definitely playable but at least you know if you really wanted to play some pub g that you would definitely be able to okay so let's take a look at some call of duty mobile graphics look good enough
it's pretty smooth
don't see any lag
so here we are in the web browser and you can see that the text is definitely easy enough to read even though it's not 1080p and you can always zoom in if you really needed to see the text a little better but it's definitely sharp enough to be readable
put a sim card in the little tray with the sd card and it did not recognize that there was a sim card there so it doesn't have any cellular capabilities
so let's take a look at the camera here and if we go into the settings we can see what the resolutions are going to be for the camera and the video quality as you can see the back
but it's good enough
so here's what the front selfie camera looks like and sounds like it does seem to struggle a little bit in those lower light situations but when there is definitely enough light
you shouldn't have any problems taking pictures with this tablet so i did try to slow the tablet down a little bit by installing quite a few uh programs on here and it definitely has not changed anything whatsoever
you're going to watch
it's not horrible again
it's very easy to see the screen because there's not a ton of light but if you have this maybe in some sunlight or if you're using it outside you may have issues seeing the screen well because the brightness does not go up a lot it also doesn't have automatic brightness so whatever you set the brightness at that's what it's going to stay at but for de for normal use
it is at full brightness and if i turn it 90 degrees there's pretty much no change in what you can see on the screen and that's pretty good for an lcd
is its battery life
i got about 12 and a half hours of on-screen time at 50 percent brightness with this tablet because at 50 brightness you can easily see the screen indoors and basically what i did was i let it stream youtube videos the whole time it was on i charged it to 100 and let it drain all the way down to one and i got about like i said 12 and a half hours of screen on time
i recharged the tablet
so i've gotten to use this tablet over the course of the past week and it definitely has a lot of good things going for it even though the screen is only 720p
nice and loud
it also has that dock capability in case you want to hook it up to the optional keyboard so you can use it kind of like a little mini laptop on the go picture
quality is good but again if you're buying a budget tablet you're really not buying it for the picture quality so it'll get by with taking videos and pictures if you really need to build quality on this tablet is also pretty good
if you're going to be using it inside you can turn it down to 50 brightness and get that 12 and a half hours of screen on time but again you can also turn it all the way up battery life will just take a little
bit of a hit the tablet's also pretty snappy especially after loading a whole bunch of games and apps on here anytime scrolling through the ui or through the apps did i see any lag
the only time you're really going to see any lag is if you put a a game or something on here that utilizes a high higher graphics that the tablet really can't handle but other than that on day to day usage
i will be putting a link in the description in case you guys want to pick this up yourself and if you guys like me and you want to support my channel please use those links because it helps me
so you guys so
two-in-one comes with a ton of accessories at an amazing price point so it has a just a terrific value and you know as kids are going back to school and doing distance learning
this might be a great solution for them so i wanted to pick it up and review it because honestly there's just not that many chrome os tablets on the market right now
that's unbelievable pricing
so i just had to check it out now in the box like i said you get the keyboard that does have a trackpad and that keyboard connects to the bottom of the tablet via pins and magnets
like you've seen a lot of tablet two and ones you also get the backside kickstand now this connects to the back of the tablet via magnets as well and it's got this kind of fabric cover on on the back side of it
that feels nice
inch lenovo tablet now
it's a 10.1
they're nice and clicky
like i said so
it has a rear 8 megapixel camera a front two megapixel camera and the tablet by itself weighs just under a pound and then when you add the keyboard and backstand to it it comes in a little bit over two pounds now to put all the specs in layman terms
it doesn't have overwhelming specs when it comes to processor memory storage or anything like that but the thing about it is it's running chrome os which is a very lightweight operating system and it doesn't need a super powerful processor or a lot of storage to be able to run efficiently so while this is kind of underwhelming in terms of specs
with this screen it is like i said full hd 1920 by 1200 and it's 1200 because it's actually a 16 by 10 screen and i think that's kind of the sweet spot for a tablet for to use in both landscape and portrait mode
it gets 400
nits of brightness
so it gets nice and bright you can use it outside however the ips screen is pretty glossy so on a sunny day it might be a little bit hard to see but overall i think the screen is great
the other nice thing
that lenovo did that
so that when you're in landscape mode it is on top of the display rather than on the side like on an ipad so you know when you're typically you're using landscape mode to be more productive and that's when you're probably going to be you know conferencing with teachers or you know having web conferences with your work or with your boss you know you want it up top so that it looks like a laptop would rather than on the side so super simple but i love that
i would put it
inch tablet the keyboard is gonna be much smaller than a regular full size keyboard would be but you know you get used to it after a while the trackpad is also very small
when it is closed onto the screen it does act as a cover which is very nice however it is a little bit flimsy and not magnetized to the screen at all so it does slide around a little bit
when you're carrying it just something to make note of now the back cover slash kickstand is really nice to have especially when you take the keyboard off and you just want to watch a show or have it propped up to view without any hands
this is where you really need to know and understand what this is capable of and what you're looking for in a computer if you're buying this to be your primary work computer to do super intensive tasks multitasking
and it's built that way in both a software and hardware standpoint whereas when you have the keyboard and kickstand attached you have kind of this laptop that you can do web browsing social media emailing anything like that and then you shed the keyboard
and you have this tablet with a kickstand for watching shows or watching any sort of media youtube and that sort of thing and then you can shed the kickstand and then just hold it as a tablet for gaming or whatever else you want to do
you know lightweight tasks that it's built for when it comes to having multiple tabs open on chrome having multiple apps open at the same time emailing that sort of thing
play store now
however there's a wide selection of games and they play very well on this device and overall i gotta say that chrome os did a great job of their tablet software whereas when you attach the keyboard it goes into kind of your laptop mode where you have kind of a desktop with the apps on the bottom that you can customize and then when you take the keyboard off you're brought up into more of a tablet touchscreen mode that you can easily access your apps that way
however with medium usage brightness at about 50 to 60 percent i easily get seven to eight hours of battery life so as long as you go into this purchase knowing that this is not going to be a primary work
first computer this is going to be more for a student or someone that wants a secondary computer for gaming or you know watching shows or doing research or social media anything like that emailing then you're going to be pleasantly surprised because this thing is a terrific terrific value
i mean any other tablet that you're gonna buy those things you're gonna have to buy separately and they're typically 100 to 200 and at a price that's lower than the lowest priced ipad
right now so again
Dow tee pad 10.1
inch tablet so in this box you can see that is a large tablet provided which is neatly recessed into this phone kind of things and then there is accessory box below then as usual there is a manual instruction manual warranty cards in all the languages given
so it's a dual
SIM tablet
here you can see
and show you
it's not a fast
charger is normal type
BCC or USB cable and if you want to plug your USB data into your table you can simply put it here you can plug to your USB and plug this one into a reversible charging cable to start working
ya can see
let's go to the setting if you can see if quickly we can see the settings into settings and the version it is having about t-phone okay now you can see
what is online
it's quite normal
you can read
the YouTube works very fine without any much issues and loudly any school going up so my recommendation is like 499 euros this is really nice thing available so if you want to have or give someone for your kids or to school going kids yeah
but it doesn't look too bad from an angle and it's actually better than some other budget tablets that I have used for those interested the Geekbench multi-core score came in at 630-7 the king pad k77 comes with a very thick silicone cover with reinforced corners
YouTube videos and Netflix
thanks for watching
okay guys so today
flexible design tablet
okay so
I'm gonna pause until I figure fate okay so I gotta I just gotta like pause and I've got a I better show you guys what I got when I actually figured this whole thing out
it's pretty good
I like it though
okay so now
I mean honestly
okay now we have
roll the clip
okay guys
we all got this
I just use it but though tell me if this drawing is good if not I don't know and if you liked the video leave a like and they're like it leave another like and don't forget to do something
what's up guys so
souls sent me
I'm worried about accepting things that people offer me in a kid for a review on the channel but one thing I've activated to improve that and get better at it's things like organics texture painting just general things that are really hard to do with a mouse
that's probably why
I don't do it so yeah I'm gonna see how this tablet works just kind of do an overview of it gonna tell you what I like about it some things I might not necessarily like will see
so here's an unboxing
it felt sturdy
I was worried about
coming off
that's my camera
if we open it real quick and kind of see how it's set up you can have a very small angle or a very steep angle depending on how you want it to set up and here it is on the stand super stable and looks really good with my set up with this tablet you get a drawing glove which prevents surface imperfections on the screen
I ran into now
this can be solved pretty easily by going to your control panel changing to large icons clicking on tablet PC settings and then choosing your tablet for display the next problem I encountered was where my pen wasn't actually where the cursor was
everything was super responsive
you know
you don't want to have to be sculpting and have it dragged behind with a bad delay absolutely no delay on this thing everything was working completely fine right when
whereas with a mouse you would have to go in and adjust the strength manually and waste more time that way one thing that did annoy me with the screen however it was that when
it's not terrible and you have to put a pretty significant amount of pressure on there but when it does show up it's pretty visible and annoying one other minor complaint
fine they're completely functional
everything else about this tablet is awesome and makes up for those two minor issues especially the buttons on the side which are super responsive and allow you to map all sorts of different keystrokes to the tablet
okay first things
now this is a mid-range drawing tablet it's intended for people just getting started or wanting something that won't break the bank of course if you're a professional you could go out and spend thousands of dollars on premium premium drawing tablets stuff that will have a lot more features and capabilities but given all the functionalities of this thing
I don't think I'd spend a dollar over 400 and since it's well under that I think it's worth the price now whether to sponsor sending me something or perhaps a family member or friend giving me a new tech product
I always like to approach review from the question of would I buy this thing for myself now given the price point and the functionality and all the things discussed in the video I would rate this thing at a 90 percent out of 100
I think it was worth an a but I don't think it's perfect simply because of those two issues I discussed with little pressure sensitivity and the flimsiness of the buttons on the pen but they were such minor issues that it was not worth it going below an A
I'm not gonna BS my audience if I didn't like this thing I would have told you I genuinely am going to be using this more aside from this review even a year from now
I think I'll actually be using this thing it's really good and if I do any product reviews in the future rest assured I'm going to give you I complete 100% honesty on what I think of the products and this is one that I think is a quality product
you've got two buttons here a camera button zooming in and this one zooms out and this is actually a touchscreen and you can even swipe on this screen just like a real phone or tablet in some of the modes but um you have an animal mode and you have an ABC mode and then you have a shape mode the light-up screen to learn
hey we can swipe through the different shapes and then you have a number mode you can just scroll through now is a downside of how little time it shows the number you can barely even see it before it disappears so that is a downside and you have a message mode and you have a calculator mode where it will count the dots and you swipe and it will count to four and then it will count to five and so forth and then you have instrument mode and guitar and you have trumpet and drums
there's the drums and then you have a music mode you can go through the different nursery rhymes and then you have a clock and it will tell you the weather and that's about it for this toy it's really cute kind of simple but if it's something you're looking for something to imitate your own tablet for your child this is pretty cool and I hope this review helps you if you have any questions
Oh the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life you deeply if you did the Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the grave
hey everyone it's siege
i know it's pretty different from my other tablet reviews because my face is on the way now but get used to it because this is going to be the new setup of every tablet review
and now
the pd 1560
so i know i'm supposed to be unboxing that box but i saved it in the end of the video because it's kind of funny and i made those as bloopers but here is what was inside the box
the first thing you will see upon opening the box is the pamphlet where it states on where to download the driver and the quick start guide then on the side you can see a little box it actually contains all of the screws cables the artist gloves more cables the pen holder with the nibs inside more cables
this thing right here
so that's good
oh my gosh
10 short fit keys
hey i am back
but it's no biggie
and the cursor but right after you recalibrate the monitor things are good to go the express keys work really well though they are a little bit wobbly when you press them but again not big of a deal
this is for you
and we're done now
i really do hope you enjoyed even though this is a simple review if you did please hit that like button and if you are interested in getting this tablet right here i'm gonna leave all the details in the description box below so you better read this and if you haven't already please do hit that subscribe button and turn that bell on
that's all for me
thank you again
i shouldn't do that
keep it kid friendly
i'm having troubles
i'm just gonna
this is their kids
the one thing that is covered up in this case is you will not have access to the memory card so if you need to put a memory card you have to put it
it does work actually in either direction although it works better the other direction but if you had like for instance if you had a table that was kind of slightly leaning in that direction rather than doing something like this where it's going to fall over you can actually angle it the other way so very versatile in terms of how the how the handle works as a stand is very easy to do obviously and kids can easily figure that one out but it is very very protective
so the kids can take photos or use them for chatting or whichever so but that's the new style handle stay in the case obviously designed for kids or for people that are need something
one other thing is you do have access to the the charge port as well so don't want to say that otherwise if you have any comments post those below
I will post a link to new styles case just below here in the description otherwise you can always go to Amazon and just type in new style one-word Fire tablet cases and you'll see their various assortment three of which I have done reviews on and I want to say thanks to the guys over new stuff for sending these over to me
I really enjoyed the cases guys and I like the three highly vastly different cases that I got so thanks to those over and I hope you guys enjoyed it

we're at tech couch
he has the micro
SD memory card
slot you can put a memory card in and there speak is blue in at the top he takes USB type-c charging port and he also takes a three point five millimeters headphone
the resolution is 2560
x 1600
you can see
am i protecting blue
I go through this without damaging your eye it also has an independent immersive speaker between so gives a good surround sound system when you're watching a video etc I also has a good decent em RAM and storage
ok 4800 mah particular burtom battery capacity and we've USB type-c charging so when the charge does run out and put the charge important and plus because a USB type-c they charge up a lot quicker than a micro USB charging port
what we charge up again you will charge up very quickly and because he has is such a high battery capacity but we wouldn't go that easily ok so this is the sayings he has a Wi-Fi the Bluetooth he also has the hot spoke etc like and no more Android software would
so eight gigs
it's not ok depends
and that's the battery their memories here the users you can add extra users it goes gestures as well jump to camera so it does have a few good features but the main thing that stands out for this is the 4k video playback and the battery capacity of the USB type-c and the build quality of this the metal build quality and the price range of this is around 100 pounds UK currency so it does really compete with other ones cause moving 100-pound and you my Samsung one
it's most likely gonna be a plastic build whereas this one made out very nice metal build and goes location security accounts backup etc and go to about tablet you know
Maru is ma
he's quite slow
okay it does have a good few features price-wise it's is over over harder plans and it does compete with have or tablets and I can really say this is a tablet to go for because there's alpha tablets that have bear bear operating system and they don't don't slow down okay and you do want to slow tablet where you press back and takes ages to go back okay
this is the Wacom Intuos 5 graphics tablet now in the principle of the graphics tablet is simple it takes over those functions that you would normally perform with a mouse but the difference is that rather than using the mouse as a pointer
and if you're gonna get an article past the editor's desk then you've got to make sure not only the words but more importantly the photographs are up to the pretty good standard
I took this photograph
there were two cars
I needed to extract the subject of the picture which is the case in the foreground and put it against a new background and I did all that in Photoshop using a mess and it was hard work had I had the Wacom tablet
the first is a battery which is used to power the tablet when it's no longer connected by cable to the computer and that goes under this little cover here and then there are two other pieces
one is the wireless transmitter which stays connected to the tablet here and then there is a dongle which is housed here underneath the tablet but then plugs into the USB port on your computer when you wish to use it now I don't have that dongle so I can't demonstrate this tablet in Wireless mode now on the side of the tablet there is a USB port here
Express keys there are four at the top and four here and these are user programmable and they can have whatever function that you would wish to assign to them and then in the center here is a touch ring
it could detect the angle of the pen from minus 62 plus 60 degree and it's working to a resolution of 5080 lines per inch so all of that adds up to far greater capability than any mass could ever provide
now this is
I press a little harder and you can see the difference quite clearly and that means you can start to get expression in your strokes so in places where it pushes slightly harder
you get a display here of the angle that you're holding the pen at and shallow angle if I raise it vertically you can see the pen tip is changing on the paper and also the angle is being shown there now
one of the other things is if you have a look here you can see this pressure gauge as I press down you can see that the pressure that I'm exerting is being registered now I can now go to the setting of the functions of things like the Express keys now at this point I think point you can have different functions for those keys for different applications and if you look here this fourth Express key here
well that's fine
that's one step backwards
so that's what
however you like there are drop-down menus associated with each and you can even set up a series of keystrokes associated with them as I did for this functionality in Photoshop
which is what
I'm using to put this video together with and I want to now add Adobe Premiere Elements to my list of applications so I'm going to press the plus button here so and I've got it running at the moment so there's Adobe Premiere Elements like so
the bottom pen button to represent a backward key stroke so I've selected it and I'm gonna say keystroke and I gotta give my keyboard and press the left hand arrow key that's okay and I want the top button on the pen to represent a right hand keystroke like so and so what that name means if I just this time so here I am in Premiere Elements and I've got my cursor here and if I press the bottom button on the pen
I've got a photograph here and there's some bits on it which I want to remove using the Spot Healing tool so I'm just going to use the pen on the tablet and you watch what happens right here the lines
isn't that nice
I want to make that a little nicer so I'm going to go to the quick selection tool and I'm going to get this selected and it can't be really really quick because my use of the pen now is pretty accurate obviously
Photoshop to have a very accurate way of getting the selections done that you want to do and there we go just about there and I'll just do a little bit of refining the edge you're getting the pressure sensitivity
that's that done
I can now copy
so you can move a cursor around but you can do more things you can get it to do zooming in and out just by using your fingers and there are many other functions which
now using the setup program you can set the individual function keys and the buttons on the pen to be tailored to every individual application you run and that might be
whatever it is you can individually program that the function keys and the pen to react in a different way to each of those programs so you can get your workflow set up just the way you want for every application now
I think that I will probably be able to manage with the small version and that has an active area about the same size as this white piece of paper
I would recommend anyone getting one of these to get the touch version because I've discovered that the functionality of being able to just use this like a trackpad on a notebook computer and with all the gesture sensitivity and so on I find that extremely useful I would really recommend you go to the Wacom website and have a look at the user manual for the enjoys five and I think then you'll discover a lot more about it more things than I've been able to show you today
Before I do a side-by-side comparison of the new iPad Pro and the new Fire HD 8, brand new, just released, I want to remind you guys of a couple of things.
Pro. It's shocking.
You can see
Just a little secret.
It's not gorgeous.
It's very practical.
So that is key.
Obviously, you could get the 10-inch Fire tablet, but for the point of this price comparison, you'll notice that the eight-inch screen is obviously significantly smaller than the screen on the iPad Pro.
Safari, definitely a more expansive, advanced browser that I don't think is as good as Google Chrome, but it is better than Silk if you put them side by side.
One, two, three. Silk.
There we go.
That is frightening.
There we go.
One, two, three.
more white, the black are a little bit darker, and side by side, you can see that there's almost like a slightly yellowish tint, almost, or an off-white, kinda cream color, when a white is depicted on the Fire tablet.
If you were to load something like Prime Video, it's always, this is the first time I'm actually using it on this tablet, but it's always going to load faster.
Netflix, as a whole, fast on both tablets, but if you are part of the Amazon ecosystem, it is all built deliberately to run the way it does on a Fire tablet and you're going to be more than impressed.
If you look at the two tablets side by side, you're going to find that the Fire tablet, despite all of its controls and how easy it is to use, the video is at a slight disadvantage compared to the retina display on the iPad Pro.
But that's understandable, right?
I think the most pronounced difference between the two is going to be the cameras, and with that, we're gonna do an HD video test right now. Welcome to my new balcony in my new home if you guys haven't noticed yet.
Let's do video.
Gonna switch to video.
It's not that intuitive.
(camera clicks)
(tablet thumps)
So far, so good.
One, two, three.
(tablet smacks)
That's gotta hurt.
to the back of the case, it doesn't get as marked up or as marred as that beautiful glass and chrome exterior that we see on Apple products, so here we go.
(tablet bangs) (tablet slams)
That was hard.
(tablet slams) Almost perfect.
One, two, three.
(tablet bangs)
Obviously, you have to be careful not to cut your hands on the glass and I don't recommend doing this at home, but it is working perfectly as a tablet.
And it's great for consuming content, so for surfing the internet on your couch, for using this as a media player, for giving this to a kid or a teen or a tween where they can watch their content and there are all parent controls available to parents.
This is a tablet
There's no way in my right mind that I'm going to hand any child of mine an iPad. But I'd gladly give someone this. This is also a great gift.
You could download the Roku app, the Fire TV app. There's infinite ways that you can implement this into your world without having to spend a lot of money or commit to it.
With that being said, the cameras on here, whether it's for a front-facing camera conversation or the rear camera for capturing video and hoping to do any tasks that involve photo editing or video
what's up guys chicks
the tablet runs Windows and Android on a dual boot has a full HD IPS screen and comes with quite a nice keyboard dock so this is the Chewie high ten plus so let's begin with a very quick unboxing so first of all
and it's made out of this suede material so it's got a magnetic flap here which is quite nice and when you open it up you have yourself a full
so this is everything you get in the tablet box you have your paperwork user manuals and warranty information a USB power brick here and in this bag we have a USB type-c cable and last but not least the tablet itself so I've put the specs on the screen so you guys can have a quick read so here
we've got 2 megapixels on the front and we have 2 megapixels on the back we also got built-in Wi-Fi AC Bluetooth version 4 and this also comes pre-installed with Windows
on a dual boot so I've just logged into Android and this is what it looks like and you can swipe down at any time and you can immediately switch to Windows just by tapping this button here and it will ask you whether you want to boot - windows you hit OK and you'll be in the Windows operating system so that's how easy and convenient it is to switch between oasis
and you've got
this brushed aluminium effect
it looks really nice
viewing angles are great
HD screen is gorgeous
headphone jack a mini
HDMI port a micro USB port for data transfer a USB C port for fast charging and you even have a micro SD card slot and another speaker on this side so we have two speakers on either side for that stereo sound
we have a magnetic dock for the keyboard so this is of course a two-in-one device so you can use it as a regular tablet or you can dock it onto the keyboard and the flaps on the back are magnetic plates and you just attach them together to give you a nice stand so you now have yourself a laptop with a full
so this test has some gaming on this tablet so for your advanced users out there here is your DRM info if we go into cpu-z so the device does not come rooted so in the Wi-Fi speed test we've got download speeds of twenty eight point nine nine megabits per second and upload speeds of nine point five four megabits per second and in the antutu benchmark test
we got a total score of fifty eight thousand and seventeen so I've just rebooted and we are now going to log in to Windows 10 okay so we are now logged into Windows
turn you have all the use your Windows 10 apps you would expect to find you also have the Windows app store so you can download mini games and apps from here so I'm just testing out YouTube's performance under Windows 10 and you can stream a maximum of 1440p
it's nice and bright with great viewing angles and playing games and watching videos is a treat now the 2 megapixel camera is quite bad and I definitely would not be taking any photos with it however you can use it as a webcam for video chats but again don't expect good quality from the cameras another small niggle I found was when you dock the tablet to the keyboard you cannot change the angle it is basically fixed so it's okay to use on the desk but if you were lying down and watching videos the angle will be off and you cannot adjust it
furthermore there is no full-size USB port but you always have the option to use a USB C hub just like on the new MacBooks and this seems like the way forward for mobile computing
hi so today
we're gonna show you how you can connect tori to a door access control or any uh switches so you need to get one of our relay boxes here and um so this is what it is it
that's a relay box and then you'll also have a connecting cable that you can just connect this through usb to tory and um here we've connected uh to the normal close and also common um so what that means
is that the door
then it's gonna open the device so here after going into the settings page you need to go to extensions and here you need to select device operation and we've selected mode 3 which is after tori has detected and somebody passed the temperature
you can select for more settings so here we've selected only allow access for the results of the pass of the temperature reading and you can add conditions like it will also when you allow access for wearing a mask and also you can say allow access for um your employees so these three conditions can all exist at the same time so for these reviews
okay so basically
thank you you
OS 5.44 specs
this is a quad-core
this one is a bit thicker and heavier but overall we have a very similar design and that means plastic on the back and the sides and glass on the front unfortunately we still get very big bezels
all around the screen
supposedly the screen was improved on this year's generation however I can barely tell the difference between this one and last year screen the resolution is just above 720p W angles are pretty good but the colors are kind of washed out the black sheep more like great
the screen is very reflective and it doesn't seem to get as bright so I will now take this tablet outside is going to be a bit difficult to actually see the screen
and don't expect if you're gonna take some great pictures to the camera or better off if you don't take any pictures with it and on the front we have a VGA camera and once again
OTG and that means that he can plug in any USB stick and the tablet will be able to read whatever you offer on that USB stick and the quality from the 3.5 million jackets decent but another bet that I've heard on the right hand side
we have about 12 left and the speed that I got for the internal storage are quite good and moving to the other side of the tablet that we have two speakers now personally as expecting that the speaker should be much louder but all the others
the battery life on this generation seems to be improved as well and you easily make it like two days on one battle each other but again this will depend on what you do with your tablet for performance
even though those low scores are not gonna have any issues whenever you're browsing so for example if you're using Chrome you can scroll up scroll down zoom in zoom out and everything needs Danna fairly smoothly for the YouTube app
that this tablet doesn't actually come pre-installed the Google Play Store like most other Android devices however there is a very easy way to get the Google Play Store installed and if you are curious to see how that's done I'm gonna leave a link in the video's description and moving on to gaming the tablet performs okay for gaming as well of course is not a powerhouse
so don't expect them like high graphics game to go good on this tablet but for your basic games it will do just fine and we are moving to the operating system so this tablet
four point zero point zero now this is based on android 5.1.1 and that's basically a three year old operating system even though that doesn't sound too amazing the tablet performs quite well that an operating system that it's cut and it's very well optimized for it
so basically you have access to all your books all your videos of Amazon Prime and so on however even if you are not an Amazon Prime member you can easily buy one of these
so don't imagine they're going to be using the tablet for Google Maps because that's going to be impossible as for sensors since it's to achieve device you don't really have that many sensors available another feature that I was looking forward towards the Amazon's personal assistant called Alexa
I'm in Canada
I wasn't actually able to get Alex I going so I can't really tell you how good it works on this tablet which isn't quite unfortunate and it's time to conclude these videos overall for a tablet
it costs only $79
thanks for watching
hi this is
Sirte size and shape
it looks a lot like a Google Nexus 7 tablet which is also inexpensive at 199 but the memo pad has a lower resolution 1024 by 600 pixel display a slower single core processor and a couple of other changes so if we look at sort of the fit and finish they look pretty similar on the back
there's on the bottom
SD card slot
here are something you don't get on the Nexus tablet and we've got micro USB a fairly loud speaker here volume and power buttons and a headphone jack and that's about it for for what you find around the sides so let's go head and turn it on and take a quick look at overall performance of this tablet is not too bad
playing games works pretty well and the speakers not too bad now can take a little bit longer to do certain things like rotating the screen or launching applications then on a tablet with a faster processor for the most part
let's just show you another one here in terms of sort of launching a game so you know there's a little bit of lag while you're waiting for things to open
and what that means is you don't have the wide viewing angles that you get on something like the Nexus 7 so go ahead and turn these both on and you'll see that the Nexus 7 and the MooMoo pad side-by-side
don't look that different
but then if you put them down on the table flat the colors are completely washed out on the memo pad at this particular angle and they look just fine on the Nexus 7 so again
oh basically when you're on anything but let's just take a look at sort of the typical size of an android application if you're looking at the shortcuts up close you don't really see a lot of pixelization or pixelation around the sides of each individual item on the nexus 7 with the 1280 by 800 pixel display
that's kind of hard to see on this particular video but it almost feels like you're actually touching the area that's moving on this display whereas here it feels like you're touching sort of just above the item
that's moving so it feels like there's a little bit of a gap almost between the top of this or the glass and the touch area below it so the screen is really not stellar other than that
I think you're getting a much much better tablet for your money and it seems a little bit strange to me that of all the corners that were cut here
your experience won't be quite as bad but you know for a little bit more money or especially since this is an older tablet if you find it refurbished or a used version you can almost get it for the same price so
Linder with low appearing
Android tablet modern Obst 7:02 others can use it but it's mainly for kids because he has a lot of educational apps booing and made by Iowa and he also has preparing to controls as well so the build quality and the quality of this tablet feels very cheap
UK currency
it has a micro
SD memory card speakers here at the back here now this comes with a micro USB charging cable and he also comes with a screen protector as well it comes with a user menu and this under tablet has Android and go addition software built into
ok and when he when he starts up you will see why it's made for kids because it will automatically go to the Kids Zone basically so kids can automatically star
600 HD okay
and if you want to go to the adults you have to put you have to actually add those up so 7 plus 6 equals and say a password as well
ok here is all same thing you have to also do the number and then say a past you have to have a password so kids mode is slightly slow but you know we got games for example
I got the kids games got learning you got all educational games minigames themes kids store browser camera gallery and he also has video music and calculator so if most of the things out here is for kids and is very educational
it's not the best but it's made specifically for kids and he has a lot of educational apps for them to learn as well and you have the option to you know to have that parent of controls so you can put limits on it etc so they can play you know play games etc for a certain time before so automatically stops okay so other than that
hi everyone i am back with a new video and this is going to be an unboxing review and demonstration of the agamon m10k graphic tablet which was sent to me by cindy from gaomon
so thank you so much for sending this to me and as a bonus content i will also give four tips on how to create a digital watercolor portrait on photoshop
i will also have timestamps here on the video for the different sections in case you want to skip into a different section that you want to watch so let's get started with the unboxing
a graphic tablet
then i connected the tablet to the computer using the provided usb cable and i was done i then played around with the settings on the tablet since you can change and assign express keys and shortcuts to the 10 keys that they have on the tablet so i decided to add the main commands i use for watercolor portraits
adjust the brush size
dial however you cannot actually customize the functions on this one so it comes as is you can however customize the buttons on the stylus to help improve your workflow for the demonstration
digital watercolor style in photoshop just because and whilst the speed paint is playing in the background i will talk about my first impression of the tablet as well as sprinkle some tips here and there on how i create a digital watercolor effect
the stylus is when you move it around the tablet and whilst this is a good thing if you're a long time digital artist since it does help with your workflow and it allows you to control the cursor a little bit better
i think that it can be a bit of a learning curve for a beginner digital artist such as myself and especially if you're moving from traditional media to a digital media if you're starting with just digital drawings
for example i started with traditional media like pencils and watercolors so this is something that i was definitely taken aback when i connected it for the very first time and there wasn't anywhere in the settings where i could adjust it however like with everything else with practice and with time i ended up getting used to the sensitivity of the stylist after doing a couple of drawings with it
but i'm no longer as taken aback by the sensitivity of the stylist and i've definitely found ways to work around it so as a first tip don't forget to use the zoom function i know this is a no-brainer for any digital artist
it's definitely one of the many advantages with working on the computer and with a graphic tablet is because you can zoom however coming from traditional art since i am not used to having the zoom function with my own watercolor paintings anytime i want to focus on a detail
so i had to use it to my advantage and i would highly recommend that you also use it to your advantage and i found that it actually helps tackle the hypersensitive stylus issue that i have so by zooming in i was able to create smaller hand movements therefore allowing myself a better control with my hands which then results to a better control on the lines that i draw on the screen especially because this is a screenless tablet so the surface that i'm drawing on isn't necessarily where the drawing is gonna go on if that makes any sense but anyway this is also how i'm able to refine my sketch so it's basically ready for me to add colors second thing i really liked about
um i'm not entirely sure if this is a thing because i only own two tablets so far so i don't know if this is a feature for every graphic tablet but it definitely wasn't a feature in the one that i owned which was actually way more expensive but anyway i did find it super useful to add a command d on one of my express keys as this is a commonly used shortcut for my digital watercolors and i'm talking about command d in mac
i'm not entirely sure what it would be on a windows but this is the tool that i use to get rid of the lasso tool and speaking of my second tip is to use the lasso tool this is my beloved tool
and then that's when i add a solid color to that highlighted section and then i press command d to easily get rid of the marquee lines so instead of actually doing it on the keyboard having to do it with just one button is actually pretty cool for me
the reason why i do this is because i like to think as if i'm painting with actual watercolors and with actual brushes so i think as if the lasso tool the shape that i'm creating with that is the exact same shape that i would create with a brush so for example i just created a flat wash as my base color and then in a traditional sense i wait for it to dry but in this case there is no drying time which is perfect so then i add another layer on top of that to add the shadows
i then add way more layers to add other colors like a dark brown for the shadows purple to add dimension to the skin and red for the blush so these are all the colors that i use for the skin when it comes to the watercolor effect um so like i said
and it's pretty good for um how sensitive it is as well to pressure not just to the speed um it allows me to just draw softly with the stylus and that already creates a soft um translucent layer of watercolor so then this whole look pretty much represents or captures a textured brush
look to the skin
the watercolor effect where the paint bleeds onto the layer underneath because watercolor is also very hard to control so there will be some inconsistencies and i think that imperfection is what creates the whole watercolor effect
i downloaded them
maybe a year or two ago however i believe now it comes with the adobe creative cloud license so if you have a new version or the latest version of photoshop
that you can use and i just selected from those ones so i make sure that when i'm using a watercolor brush from the pack and i switch to a smudge tool
if it comes from the dry media pack then i make sure that the smudge tool that i'm using comes from the dry media pack similar to when i'm also using an eraser tip number
recently i've been setting it to color burn because it just makes the colors pop a little bit more whereas i find that multiply makes it a little bit dull and a bit dark but it's completely up to you
however i made my own by taking a photo of a watercolor paper that i already had and i just edited the image to get rid of some shadows and basically used it for this mona lisa drawing
i used in this drawing so you can use it for free for your drawings as well so overall my experience with the gaomon graphic tablet would be pretty evened out by the positives and slight negatives so the setup was easy the express keys were super customizable however the stylus sensitivity for me was a learning curve
so it'll be perfect for beginners to gain control of the cursor as they're learning and if they need more sensitivity in the stylus then there's that option to advance into it as well
unfortunately i couldn't find a setting to do that so that's just something that i would like to see in another tablet that i would work with in the future another thing i would love to see on a graphic tablet especially this one is for the dial to be a button as well as a touch wheel so currently it's only a touch wheel and like i mentioned before you can switch between the different functions however i found that switching from zoom then to brush size then to scroll was kind of a clunky experience
if you zoom with a mouse on photoshop the zoom function actually takes you to the section where your cursor is located especially if it's located on a canvas so that eliminates the need to scroll the zoom function on the graphic tablet however does not have the same advanced function
it only zooms in the center of the canvas and if you're adding detail to the bottom of the canvas for example you have to scroll down to it and aside from that the button in the middle of the dial allows you to switch only from zoom to brush size and then to scroll which like i said doesn't work with how i naturally work so i would actually change that order to zoom and then to scroll and then to brush size or another improvement would be to keep the touch dial as just a zoom and brush size function and then add an up down left and right buttons on the dial which allows you to scroll as well right after you zoom
now this did not have that function and i couldn't change it on the settings as well but i suppose this is what separates this specific tablet from other more expensive tablets because this does retail for 65.99
us dollars on amazon
it's full of accessories such as the drawing glove eight pen nibs a fabric case and an attached pen holder to the graphic tablet which is pretty cool in my opinion but it is a decent graphic tablet
who haven't really figured out their workflow just yet and want to try digital art but don't want to commit just yet and i just want to say that gaomon is having a special promotion on amazon right now as you can see on the screen so if you're very much interested in that then i suggest that you check them out

so his review
we're not going to telling these by the way it's just for reference and possibly entertainment if this comes are so funny which it probably won't certainly and the unique thing about this tablet is it has the case bolted onto it so you don't really have a choice whether the a case or not
it's not softly anyway
which is oh
I lied right
if any tablets that come with a full-sized USB port built-in usually use an adapter bye Hilda MW now asses as a headphone port and a charger port and the meanest people or standard nice big power button full-size
that are capacitive buttons
SPECT out with some apps not particularly good apps as you can see the touchscreen is a bit others so once in general is a bit jerky sorry for all this lighting whatever light sources absolutely everywhere and it seems to be confused and so
let's show you something
i'm chinese tablets
nope just speed dial
let's go on
it's something you very rarely if ever see these days but as you see this is an old tablet and it has it so the technology is there and does work fairly well but Sir as I say doesn't normally happen
it's a resistive screen and slow processor but it does work and you could do some shopping on that just told me mean but readers very very nice machines by several okay
Angry Birds Angry Birds
I believe came
this age doesn't work but admirably it does load and makes a valiant attempt to to do something useful sadly is valiant attempts are all in vain because it just makes a pixelated are believed myths calculated being my new favorite word
it's fine
APK file which if it is would be quite nice because I'm Gerber to be very playable on this but yeah you'll see we get into the game and all the birds and all the pigs are white squares
various things on here
settings work several
i'm saying i believe a lot because i can't actually remember a lot about this tablet but that it depends and for that you do get absolutely superb bill quality
it's barely worth twenty
I got contacted by someone from Google or beyond have no idea how to say it but they make tablets and they asked if I could do a review on their 420 bottle though cause I just yes and jumped right into the opportunity
I assume three programmable buttons but I'm not very sure usually you just press them and they do different stuff you set that all up in the driver and looks really good
that's awesome
you don't click these
Keys by mistake definitely
I always like hold my finger on one button and I always seem to click it and then did its steps my play and stuff if you never got a tablet before you always get these
it's actually very small
you are only going to play with like this so I might actually have to switch to full screen for when I play also now which is not a problem really if I only play windowed mode because I cannot find a perfect size for my tablet though yeah I mean
this is definitely packaged
almost like sort of feet doesn't feel like it's going to print anytime soon so it's a it's really good quality and for the price holy like like half the price of most tablets out there and it's half the size as well
I am very impressed
I think it's the first company that I've seen that actually acknowledges and knows that people don't buy this small tablet and drop with it anymore and not most people
I like it
there's always the left hand mode you just use of stuff to like flip it around and then you just do it in left hand mode and then she would use the right hand
that's my pcs over
I guess but I would wager that most people would like it either in the middle sticking out or to the right but it's just a minor thing really you can get cube wires for like no fun at all so
I'm going to spend some time using this and reviewing this and giving it a fair review but initial reactions is that this is a damn fine packaging and product so far yeah
I thought it was to take this tip in and out but it's actually to turn the tablet on see because it uses a battery which I hate to say it but it kinda ruins the whole experience for me because the battery is in here in the end and this it it gets very very heavy because without it it actually feels very nice and light and it's very easy to maneuver and move around and stuff but as soon as you put that damn battery inside it becomes pretty hard for me at least to to move properly because this side is so heavy compared to the tip so when you have to do a very quick reaction movements then it's like this this part here just doesn't want to move right but oh well that's actually the only problem I have with the template
I don't mind the size but I'm just used to use full area on a bigger tablet so getting used to not playing well to be playing full area but for the full area to be smaller
I have not been playing with my own sampler that all I've just been playing with this for a whole week and yes exactly as I said then this having that the thing come out of the left instead of in the middle or to the right for me is a pretty significant well
I'm not significant but when I will order to play also I kind of have to my mic is in the way but I have to place it under here and then the wire goes over my keyboard
it's nothing
I mean you can't really go wrong if you don't like it then you don't like using a tablet that you should start stay with the mouse anyways so what
I guess but in conclusion then for this tablet for the price range I will give this a four out of five definitely because for the price that you are spending to get this tablet
it is really good
it is very responsive
that's it has absolutely zero input lag so it if you move with you if you use if you move your pin the damn thing follows exactly what you're doing
Eddie is an education
this is a very controlled environment and has password based access in which you can control full featured functionality of Android and access general applications like you access on any other Android tablet the Eddy tablet is powered with a seven-inch screen with a display resolution of 1024 by 600 and the specifications are not the core focus of this tablet
which allows you to control the content on the tablet for toddlers between two to ten years of age which is actually the strong point talking about the specification it is powered by Android jelly
this tablet is Wi-Fi only and does not accept any sort of sim however there is 3G dongle support so if you have a 3G USB dongle you can connect it to the stablish and use it
it comes with a food grade quality plastic bumper which keeps it safe from drops so it will not break because of the bumper which is provided and it is food grade so it is safe
there are dual camera so there is a two megapixel rear camera and 0.3 megapixel front facing camera so you can also use it for occasional photographing when you are not using it in the eddy or educational mode we believe
Eddie is a step in right direction when it comes to using technology appropriately for children when it comes to educational usage of technology this is all we have for you in this hands-on review
this is your host

thanks for watching
how what my experience worked with the tablet so after one of my recent tablets broke i managed to get some help and to purchase a new tablet which is about 300 which is a good decent chunk of change for a new display tablet
so basically to hold your pen about 10 styluses and the styluses thing to pull out even though we don't really use them and it came with a nice pin with some side buttons to it
but there's really no point in doing that so it goes real far down but i can't really bring it as far down when having this tablet you really do need to adjust the quality of it
so it'll be best if you actually change it with the auto button and the menu you basically can change to like the temperature image brightness and a lot of other things when trying to customize your screen so it can be basically something of your liking drawing on
it's really weird for me at first when i got it but it it really does work a lot because when i got the tablet i saw a big size comparison to the one that i recently used especially with the pen because the pen is more fatter and longer than the other one but for me from drawing for like a couple of days with it it really did feel really well at first
i thought it wasn't going to be like really like hard or i thought it was going to be hard honestly and it was going to really mess up with my drawings but actually it helps a lot when drawing on it and especially for people who wants to upgrade for a new display tablet
it likes wants something
that's a good price
if they want to upgrade their specs because i really had a really nice experience with it i don't know if other people might have different experiences with it but for me it really went very well for me and i hope people who buy it
also be in the more liking of how i like this tablet as well so i hope you guys really enjoyed this video and it was really a short video but i really hope you guys enjoy and i wanted to show you guys my experiences with my new tablet so i can't wait to make more videos of my art for you guys see ya you
I was supposed to unload this in America but since Cornell virus outbreak has begun I had to go back to my country as soon as possible so although almost in videos that I added before or not with me now I was frantic to pack up all my stuff at that time
I decided to review this tablet because the tablet looks really small and it's really cheap according to the company's website it says dinners drawing tablet with a thickness of only five point two millimeter and is $30
that's nice what
the drivers are useless for also because they don't have a function that adjusting pen area so please download the driver in the description below when I use this tablet I think it was okay that no cruciate being employed and teleporting
I think it's a great outlet but I don't recommend to people who usually big area because the cover is smaller than other tablets that we mostly use such as 1:48 II so they can't use the Tiber area that they use if they're areas or too wide however for small areas players
like me
okay that's it
this asked me
if i could review their dragon touch k10 android tablet when i looked at the specs especially the two gigabytes of ram it did initially put me off looking into the company i can see
we have the box
any tablet will have a hd screen but i guess because this is a budget tablet they want you to know they're not skipping out anyways moving on sliding off the cover and then removing the top of the box and removing a few more things reveals the tablet itself
i'm pretty confident
there's a warranty card
right of the k10
here's the reason
protector loves fingerprints
it's a budget tablet
it's got 10.1
inch ips display with 1280 by 800 resolution and 8 megapixel rear facing camera 2 megapixel front facing camera 32 gigabytes of internal storage 2 gigabytes of ram a quad core cpu running at 1.3 gigahertz bluetooth wi-fi 802.11
considering the price of this tablet the brightness levels are very good text is clear enough and easy to read and viewing angles are pretty good too also another thing
aka android pie
no bloatware whatsoever
remember to clear applications
netflix isn't too bad
the 55 hertz refresh rate obviously doesn't help alleviate the issue either so it's not going to be a completely smooth experience but it's something you can live with opening applications isn't super snappy but it's not super slow either and things like switching from one video to another on
you can see
i'm using both youtube
it's working perfectly
it goes without saying that you're bound to run into a few performance issues with lots of games for instance when i tested cod with the k10 the frame rate was really low
this tablet isn't made for games like these or any game that demands a lot from your device while we're on the subject of demanding games services like stadia and xbox game pass were made so that gamers could play the latest games without the need for expensive hardware as you're just streaming the game
you should theoretically just need good internet speed so i tested the k10 with xbox game pass and although it took around 40 seconds for the app to launch once it did the k10 was able to play all the games that i tried games like angry birds and candy crush ran perfectly on the k10 so more casual less
shark without many hiccups
this tablet aren't great
i feel
it sounds very tinny
it's completely flat
the k10 comes with a 5000 mah battery which dragon touch state should give you over 10 hours of watching media and gaming my testing on the tablet suggested that statement isn't completely accurate but it's close enough
so there's definitely enough juice in this tablet to watch around three to four movies as for charging time it took just slightly over two hours for it to go from six percent to ninety eight percent which is pretty good so overall
it's fast enough
the speakers aren't great
the display isn't amazing
thanks for watching
i don't wanna fight
this machine has some great features with the 1.5 gigahertz processor and the 1 gigabyte of memory is what really turned me on to this little device although updated the price was right
look at that
aluminum is not plastic
you say it has
max customer service
i'm mark duffy
in college
there's never much room given in a recording studio which are 32-channel ssl beautiful analog desk and then your computer's tucked away in the corner you don't want to room for a mouse so the standard has been to use trackball mouse
that's another thing anyway
i'm going to call it mouse just because um but yeah i had a friend of mine a designer and he went and spent a big chunk of money on an ergonomical mouse and then found that he didn't already like it
i still have it
which is my
and before we get into the pros and cons of this graphics tablet if you are enjoying this video getting something from my videos consider subscribing to my channel and ringing that bell to get notified every time i post up a new video
but don't get discouraged by these names thinking that they're going to be too small for your large 27 inch 4k monitor like i have over here in actual fact when you see the size of the working area within this graphics tablet the deco pro small is a little bit bigger than the wacom intuos pro medium and then the deco pro medium is a little bit smaller than the wacom intuos pro large so when it comes to size wise
it has eight customizable buttons plus customizable scroll wheel and track pad both the scroll wheel and the working area on the pad are illuminated which gives a nice slick look about these in previous models of the xp pen they did feel quite plasticky and cheap
which is everything you're looking for when you want this to last a long time and when you consider the fact that it's three times cheaper than wacom's equivalent it kind of it kind of nearly sells itself now
which is fantastic
i find um but yeah it's it's really nice and even though you're saving a lot of money by going to xp pen you don't lose out on the features like what you would want out of a wacom tablet
now that i've talked about the features that you would be looking at to consider what graphics tablet to buy build quality size and all the features that come with customizable buttons and pressure sensitivities
that's why i think
this will revolutionize how you edit your photos it will change everything and the great thing about the xp pens is the fact that they're affordable so you can take the risk spend 100 pounds
i use the trap
people are not going to agree with me with saying that i still use the trackball mouse and that i don't use any pressure sensitivity in any of the work that i do but i just didn't like it
i'm like i know how to use the opacity on my brush and i'm used to that i just want it to be accurate and it's quicker i find i work quicker with a graphics tablet
so who do
so just it's not to say that if you were only using lightroom you shouldn't get a graphics tablet again it's personal preference but i think it kind of be wasted on you but if you're looking for an easy to use extremely accurate way of editing
a graphics tablet is what you should be looking for to up that game level on you and if you are a graphic designer you really should be considering a graphics tablet for your work because your work is intensive
they're not for everyone
you may need to give it a month before you get comfortable with it but once you get comfortable with it you'll love it and if you like this video give it a like give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel
Bobby yes another folks
go out at night
don't they
wow that's pretty cool
and sometimes you eat vegetables and fruit to the paw patrol like chips bubby well the paw patrol are the subject of our toy review of the day for Christmas
can you press
rubbles digger who
Zuma's hovercraft is there
do you like
enjoy the tablet
roubles the man right
yeah let's take it
I'll be Bobby because of my second-favorite bubby my second favorite is Marshall Chloe and fired up the OL said I'm ready for a ruff-ruff rescue after Marshall I think sky Zimmy well it would be rocky bed you said
Rocky's not on there
because he's about moussaka and I'm pretty convinced that the rest of the pocket will have a whatsapp group about him and I don't know if you've ever seen the ones with equal to the jungle bar
oh what's that noise we don't go out we don't grind our teeth bubby that's very bad because I can't think of a specific reason at the moment but it is very bad which I dream was that fast trainer salutatory
we're at your school
Thank You bubby
Nathan here from the e-book reader calm I'm gonna give you guys a video review of the Kobe Kairos tablet today so this is one of Kobe's new Android 4.0 tablets
where this one has
we got different widgets
when we got different you can organize your apps how you want you can put them in folders so if you just drag them together you can put them in a folder
core processors go
that works well
so games like fruit
ninja work too
I'm able to find pretty much all the apps that I need so I wouldn't have to mess with the hacking it so you just got to be able to look around and know where you can get some apps
and you can get like netflix or kindle and all that so that's a good place to get out of course the one mobile market is another good place to get app so this device for instance
so this device it doesn't come with the Google Apps at all it comes with this bookmark to the mobile YouTube site which is really lame so I went ahead and installed this actual YouTube app from over like I said it's one mobile and so it's the actual YouTube app but the one thing is not gonna work
you're not gonna be able to sign in because it doesn't have the Google set up so you're not gonna be able to sign in but you can use the app to watch videos so that's definitely a plus so you can load in some of the other google apps like
so you can sign those some of these other google apps they'll work just not behold you know the you're not gonna be able to add your account obviously and that kind of thing so it comes with just a regular email which you can set up with your different accounts
I've noticed that if you use the built-in video player for your playing like AV eyes or mp4s or whatever it actually fits it to the screen where it gets rid of the black bar down there so I'm just kind of knowing with leg flicks
so once you install a certain app you will get different widgets for it and then you just you just take and hold the app essentially and drag it to your wherever you want it or the widget not enough room for that one so you just drag your widgets on there
look at the battery
I in my opinion
I like the capacitor screen and I don't really care for the glittery quality of the screen like I mentioned when the way when the backgrounds white but otherwise it's not a bad toilet if you can get it for the right price you know it's it it's suitable but you might be better off to spending some extra money and getting something with a better battery life for one and something with a better screen
i like the packaging
okay oh once again
it's quite useful
it's like this this bit here is like not like fabric but it's really soft like it's quite good grip and the button is raised up quite nicely so that you can feel it
i always think it's good when the uh button on the pen is raised up a little bit because then you don't have to like search for it you can just feel it
it's actually not as small as i was expecting like i knew it was a small tablet that they were sending me but it's not too much smaller than one of the tablets
good so on to the setup okay so the setup is really simple you just go to the xp pen drivers page type in the makeup tab that you have and click on the image of that tablet
um you do need to disable your antivirus temporarily um before extracting and installing the software but literally it takes like a few minutes to install so you can just turn it back on
it's no problem
you can click on that um obviously plug the tablet in first after you've installed it and then you can adjust the settings and it is really that simple like i had no trouble with it
it's really quick
it's great
yeah and then you can play with the pressure settings and stuff so on to using the tablet itself i did adjust the pressure sensitivity slightly rather than just using the default settings
i guess so
because i don't have much space at the moment which actually this tablet was great for that because i could literally fit my laptop and the tablet on my tiny little coffee table um which is the only space i had available so i was like
it's brilliant um
you would normally draw and i think if you're someone who travels a lot it would be great for you because you could easily fit it like on a table in a train or a park bench or something or if you draw your phone a lot
because you wouldn't necessarily want a large tablet connected to your tiny little phone screen um or just if you don't want to drag around a large tablet like this would be great because it's lightweight and small the shortcut buttons all worked fine
um i think the undo key is set to the like fourth button down which is like the ideal place for having your hand there when you're working um and the buttons have like a tiny little raised like either a dot or a line so that you can feel which button you're pressing rather than having to keep looking down on the bonds which is quite handy in terms of drawing and the pen
i like okay
um the pen itself is comfortable to hold and it didn't slip around in my hand particularly which is good um that well the only issue maybe is that when i come to put the pen down
i do think it would benefit from having like a little fabric loop attached to the tablet to use as a pen holder just to stop the pen rolling away but like honestly in general
um it's quite a basic program but like honestly if you're a beginner looking for just a low-cost tablet and a free sort of program just to experiment with this would be perfect for you because you could literally get the tablet and then download the program which is easy to do um you can go on the page on the deco page for information
um yeah and then you're all set to sort of get you started with drawing and then obviously you can move on to more advanced like programs and stuff as you get more used to it
so if you're looking for a lower cost tablet like for me i have been looking for a sort of backup tablet because i usually use it on like my ipad basically to draw so i did kind of want just a back up
so if you're someone who's looking for like a backup tablet this would be brilliant or just like you know a regular tablet and you don't want to spend a lot of money like honestly this would be perfect for you
in terms of cost
and i do yeah
i really do
love this tablet
i'm not just saying that because it's like a review video or it's been sent to me like genuinely i do think it's a great tablet and would recommend it to anyone looking for a new tablet certainly for beginners and for more experienced artists as well
earlier this month
I was contacted by a representative of a fake to do a review of their a 30 drawing tablet but God had almost a day after it was shipped and immediately out of the box
Sai - my go-to drawing program after using this tablet for a while and through a couple of restarts I've not had any of the issues my way on add
of course it also comes with some spare pen nibs and a pen nib or moving tool and instructions on how to operate your tablet on the topic of the tablet
dragging the pen nib across the tablet surface was glassy smooth but squeaky and quite loud to use but I believe it'll go away over time with wear gear there
use the tablet reads and translates pen strokes very smoothly and I was able to finally enjoy turning off the stabilizer and paint tool sai and have a way more control with my lines
Hawaiian pen is actually rechargeable and has a battery on side adding to the weight whereas the fake pen is battery of power and actually has a lot of empty space going on for it making it lighter and a little bit easier to use for the specs
the tablet has a reading height of 10 millimeters allowing you to drag the cursor across your screen with your pen no more than 10 millimeters or a little bit more than one third of an inch away from the screen overall
I genuinely appreciate
and the touchscreen capacitive sensors on the side of the tablet are honestly quite annoying if I have to keep watching where my arm is all the time or have my arm draped down to the side of me while I'm drawing
it's just a hassle
Bakke is really good
I'll put a link to the tablet in the description so you can find out on amazon easier and I hope it's also enjoy it because I know I did and I actually do believe I'll be putting the away on a 6/10 Pro away so watch out way on you've got yourself a good competitor
we have a 10.1
now if you remember correctly they released the $69 10 inch tablet and I believe it was a $49 8 inch tablet in 2019 under the same brand on but these are the pro versions new for 2020 and I'm really interested to see how these perform now inside of the box
this is not going to do any quick charging with this but you could move up to a 2 amp charger and get a little better out of it so on the bottom here
I have not seen it and I'm not sure if the older keyboard dock works with this on one side of the tablet we have a 3.5 millimeter audio jack for your headphones
we have the power
VR rogue GE
8320 it does
OpenGL and Vulcan
aren't that bad
now that's all that
I've tested in it
it might go higher but 128 will be perfect for something like this 802 11 AC Wi-Fi so you can pick up that 5 gigahertz Network and I do want to check out GeForce now and X cloud streaming to this because we have Bluetooth 4.2 built-in so I can connect pretty much any Bluetooth controller and the tablet is actually running Android 10 overall
it's a pretty clean
the kids would love them playing around with some games that incorporate the camera but overall this isn't something you want to buy to take family photos with so obviously
but as you can see the HD is definitely beating out the on pro tablet by a lot in single core and multi-core performance now this is just strictly dedicated to CPU performance so yes the Amazon Fire HD 10 does have a more powerful CPU
but what about the GPU and for that I use 3dmark sling shot extreme unfortunately the Volken part of the test didn't run on the on tablet but Vulcan is supported
I've tested it with ppsspp and a few other apps but for OpenGL we scored a 351 on the new on pro tablet and the Fire HD 10 came ahead in OpenGL with 11:58
GPU and CPU in the Amazon Fire HD 10 over the new on pro tablet and just because I'm here I did want to test out some other benchmarks that work on the on tablet here we have Geekbench 5 single core 146 multi 786
10 wasn't run this right now but I have run in the past and it scored a 128 thousand but the GPU score on the HD 10 was around 30000 so yeah that HD 10 is just much more powerful than this little tablet here one of the big things that people use these tablets for is media consumption whether streaming video from YouTube Netflix Disney Plus Hulu Amazon Prime and this works really well for it
I'm gonna go ahead and test out a video here on YouTube 1080p 60fps everything loads up relatively quickly and I really do like the speaker setup on this like I showed you
just start a random video here might be a little dark with this one but overall it does work well so if you want to buy something like this for the kids so they can watch their favorite shows on
Netflix YouTube through Disney
fancy graphics is off and we're getting an average of around 30 fps definitely not the best that I've seen out of an Android tablet but it is playable next up
we have
I mean it's kind of playable but I do notice some stutters here and there and by the way I do have the rendering resolution set to the lowest and graphic settings set to low but I have noticed a lot of slowdowns and stutters with this game
isn't that bad
quite well here
testing out on
this tablet was emulation
I'm using an Xbox one controller connected over bluetooth I'm gonna save you some time right now and just let you know that higher in emulation is not great on this device if you want to run older systems using retroarch like nes
I do have the settings as low as they can go here and this is definitely not the worst that I've seen but I have seen better out of Cheaper prepaid phones so this is an easier one to emulate
PSP emulation using ppsspp
Soulcalibur broken destiny
I haven't had really good luck with these higher and emulators on this tablet but since I'm here I figured I test one of the hardest ones to emulate and that's God of War Ghost of Sparta and like you may have guessed already
it's pretty bad no
I don't have frames skip on and you could use it here but overall if I buy a tablet for 130 dollars I don't want to have to use frame skip that these emulators and finally because everybody asks even if those other emulators don't run well they want to know if dolphin's gonna run or GameCube games and as you can see here we're running the dolphin emulator with Soulcalibur - it's pretty bad so you will not be able to run GameCube games at full speed and I've got a lot of graphical glitches going on here
I've tested Vulcan and OpenGL so after spending some time with this tablet have actually come to the conclusion that this really isn't a bad tablet for everyday use now if you're into any or native Android gaming then I would definitely stay away from it
but it's running
yes we do have those four apps pre-installed from Walmart and the little Walmart icon in the bottom but I can overlook that but yeah I mean this tablet would work out for kids or grandparents you can play Minecraft on it in roblox plus they got YouTube Disney
I will leave some links in the description if you're interested in picking one of these up or just learning a little more about it like I said you can't buy it online yet but you can find one at a store near you if you have any questions let me know in the comments below but like always
thanks for watching
I'm sure most of you did this kind of art and drawing stops in school but we have grown up and as I am learning graphics designing and 3d animation
tab fills excellent enhance
it has four buttons and a micro USB slot to connect it with your computer it has a battery free pen with one touch eraser and they also provides you extra nibs and a tool to remove the nib from the pain
this depends on the artist and I think I covered all the things that you will get anywhere if you do some research about this product all I want to say at last is that it is very good product for beginners like me
so today
then i'll show you some tests and then we'll do a little drawing demonstration so let's get started the xp pen innovator display 16 is a 15.6 inch full hd drawing monitor that is conveniently designed for drawing on the go
taking a look into the boxes content we first find the innovator itself and further down we find the stand it can only be adjusted to one level but it does the job next up
there's also a cloth to keep your new best friend clean as well as a thank you card a warranty policy and the quick setup guide which you should definitely keep nearby okay and lastly
tilt the portable stand is designed to reduce shakiness while you draw to provide a better view angle as well as a more comfortable position for your hand to work in
you must have an available hdmi port as well as at least one usb port but two of them if you want to power the innovator directly through your computer if you want to use the power supply you only need to have one available usb port then you simply connect the usbc to your tablet
it's time to connect the innovator and start it up but um the usbc fits like a glove and i mean a very tight and precise glove into the tablet
the entrance is so perfectly matched to the cable that it actually took me a few tries to finally get it in there so satisfying though and we are now officially up and running after turning on your tablet navigate to xp pens website and download the driver for your operating system
note that as a default your tablet may be assigned to your primary monitor so remember to change the work area out here to be to your tablet's monitor or just set your tablet to be your main monitor
when it's attached
i usually do that
zoom in and out undo and redo you can choose from xp pens default shortcuts in this huge panel or you can type in your own also with modifiers such as shift and control and alt in this text field
the two in one dial ring can be used for for instance changing your brush size so put in your shortcuts for increased brush size and decrease brush size here
how the shortcuts
the very first impression from drawing on the innovator 16 was that it felt like a huge upgrade from my current tablet which is the artist 22r pro also from xp pen
i actually recently borrowed a wacom cintiq 24 hd for a whole month and i have to admit personally this feeling of the innovator gets pretty darn close to that
i found that the innovator felt very reliable very much the same amount of jitter as my arches 22r pro which i hardly ever notice at all to be honest testing their response time
they have all had trouble picking up the initial few milliseconds of the stylus and that has been the biggest critique i have expressed about this brand personally but hold your horses ladies and gentlemen and everything in between the innovator 16 seems to have fixed this
in general it just feels good and intuitive to draw on the innovator 16 display and here i'm just trying to discover the perfect amount of pressure that's the sensitivity setting where it allows you to draw very thin and fine lines but adding pressure gives you thicker lines and the transition should feel somewhat seamless
i found that my personal preferred sensitivity on the innovator 16 is one tick towards firm and lastly i was just checking if it is required to use a lot of smoothing to produce nice lines but i found
so you might need to add a little bit of smoothing again depending on what software you're using so now it's time to move on to the drawing demonstration and this is also the time where i will share some more personal thoughts as well as my conclusion about the innovator 16 display tablet as well as where you can get it because right now as i'm uploading this video there is a discount but it's almost running out so let's move on the full one and a half hours footage at only 150 speed will be available on my patreon in the upcoming term
if you're left-handed you'll just have to flip it over like flip it around a 100 and whoa 180 degrees and then inside the tablet's driver you will also need to flip the display but then you set up to use it with your left hand as well another thing
i realized that is a major plus in my book is the fact that this tablet didn't get too heated even after using it for a couple of hours but more importantly the heat was mostly noticeable over by the express keys which means my hand doesn't get overheated for no reason
i'm not sure why but when my hand gets too heated when i'm drawing it starts to hurt like like it starts to hurt a lot so the fact that it gets heated in the side of the tablet i rarely use is just amazing
everything appeared nice and crisp and i think the colors are very well represented as well there is little to none texture on the screen especially compared to the previous model so this one does feel a little more like glass but the stylus felt so nice on the surface so after drawing for like 10 minutes
i especially love that
once i tried my first tablet with a dial ring i have not wanted to go back to not having one and this one had two features in one dial ring and they both worked as you would expect
i actually didn't have any weird hiccups with the innovator 16 so far if you've owned a drawing tablet of any kind before you know that they can be a bit tricky to install regardless of the brand heck i even had trouble setting up the wacom cintiq pro
i borrowed a few months back so it is just a general template thing but in general the innovator performs extremely well i have seen a few reviews on the tablet myself even before i knew i was going to review it and in one of them
they mentioned that they experienced a little bit of delay in its reaction like i mentioned before that i was a bit concerned about as well but honestly i was so positively surprised because i didn't experience any noticeable delay
i tried comparing the specs of the innovator 16 the artist 15.6 pro and the artist 22r pro in terms of report rate and response time on paper the 22r pro and innovator 16 are superior in specs over the 15.6 pro and the artist 22r pro is again on paper
the one with the best specs however my honest and personal opinion is that the innovator 16 is the superior one so much in fact that i am replacing my 22r pro with the innovator 16 as of this moment and that's really hard for me because you know you know
i like big screens
i'm publishing this video
because that's a portable drawing tablet with its own ios and it's just in its very own league so right now in terms of drawing tablets that you will need with a computer
i haven't tried so it's only based on tablets i have in my possession or have had previously and it's based on my own experiences naturally and this video is getting in the game a bit late but until september 14th 2020 xp pen is still celebrating their anniversary
i'll put the links in the description if you want to check it out for yourself or just check out more specs on this tablet breathe so there's not much more to say
Oh welcome to
Blue Morpho I am oh s which has been very popular word winning actually for kids a lot of stuff to allow parents to feel better about the screen time their kids have so
I think that's really the big selling point on the knobby SE all right so we want to start with this actually red rubber board or bumper around the knobby SC
kids will do this
and they'll do this
this really isn't about the hardware but we'll show it to you anyway and just kind of give me an idea of what you're getting has 1 gigabyte of RAM it's got a 7 inch screen
OS which runs on top of that does have a micro SD card slot where you can put an expanded storage and here comes with only 16 gigabytes as we said one gigabyte of RAM and volume control so here power switch up on top the micro USB where you can charge it up and a headphone jack over there so like we said I mean this is not something where you're getting it for the latest and greatest
you're actually getting it because it's a great deal at $79 and the really big thing about is all the software that comes with it so let's go over more the wing system the learning system the chores all that stuff and look dive a little bit deeper into the software just jumped into the wings learning system here and this is really what we think is one of the more impressive things on the Navi se and that is they've got over 16,000 lessons in here over 300,000 questions pre-k to up to sixth grade and the ideas
is that just quickly
I have to match the shape and there would be a timelessness more advanced level but everything is done very much about keeping it simple for the kids so that it very much walks you through the whole tutorial of it what to do and really be warding them and it's a lot of talk here
Tony a great job
I mean I'm obviously at a very young age when I'm doing this here but I'm basically doing a quest they're different things in this wing system where I can be learning but very much like a video game and this has been shown in size kids
you've got all that but the cool thing about the wing system is that it's really tied to lessons and so it's not just you know kind of trying to take a game and throw a lobe of an educational element to it
so there's a lot in here you know we could be going on for hours showing all of this but you know if you're into the idea of having your kids learn and their screen time be more educational that's really where something like the NA BSC which uses this wing system shine so a lot more do that what links below in the description if you want to read more about it the educators who did it all of that
let's jump in and just show you a couple other features as well all right so as we said with the wings learning system a ton there in terms of learning and it have different
Nobby interface because I think that's really if you're a parent looking to get this what you be interested in and overall I would say the idea is is to take kind of all the stuff we use on the Internet and make it more kid-friendly so there's this knobby Kinect which is like a social media for kids so of course a safe area for them to work in you've got the ability to go online and look at things but in a safe way so what they've done is kind of taking the web you know playing web and they've taken all this stuff and just put it in where it's something where kids can go in there
you know younger kids can go in there and have a safe experience and you don't have to worry about what they're going to find in there so I would say that learning is a big part of this and of course having a safe area to connect with their friends and to browse the web is key
Google Play Store and you can load up normal apps you can use as a normal Android apps android device so you can do that as well but just showing here
the camera is not super high quality but fine for kids to take some fun photos and stuff like that brows learn all that stuff so if they want if they have educational lessons they want to do
I'm gonna go over here and just show a number different games loaded up and one of the other key parts of it here going to go back just kind of give you an idea hers
we flick through some of the games that come with it so a lot of cool stuff and what we're going to go back to also is that they have a really neat thing in terms of screen time and chores and a treasure box
take a shower here
you know
they do enough chores
I will unlock that
the idea of taking the kind of screen time and using it not just to play games but also to record your chores and what you're doing and then with that treasure box able to unlock and win things so
do things like unlock
if they're learning lessons they can earn points and it all kind of works they can use in this treasure box store to actually unlock and get some other apps which they want
Android 6.0 and go in into anything like that but in terms of what you know I think the real selling point of this is the knobby mode all right so we were back in the knobby mode here
you can have multiple kids in there so you've got multiple case you can set them up and they can have their own timers and all that so over all think it really works
also like the fact that you can kind of have the knobby almost be the bad guy so there are a number of things to everything even show it but like timers
where after a p.m.
no more knobby
I think that's great
what are the other really cool things about all this is that you can get reports on exactly you know what your children have been doing so you can set all these time limits
tell them it's time to exercise how long they can play any apps all of that so you can both kind of lock them out when they've been to doing too much of something reward them when they've been doing a lot of good things like lessons but then you can also look at a report and see all right
lots of that
A standard tablet then
it's not going to break so it's safe on that side but even more importantly they're out on the web and you're not worrying about what they're getting into because it's kind of this closed environment here and there's fun stuff they can
but you know it's all password-protected they want to get into the Google Play Store so they're kind of in this closed environment and like I said they've recreated everything so you can kind of have your own social network
i do
it didn't work
it looks pretty good
well i don't think it's gonna break because at the end um it is not like the other usbs it's angled and that's a good thing to me at least the little usb things
and uh yeah i
it was very easy
and that's what i liked the most actually because with a wacom like in general i had to restart a computer to make it work and i did not want to do that
okay all right so after you install it you get this little like menu and on the space that you want to use or uh what options to put on the pen from one button on the pen you can switch from eraser to pen which is very cool but maybe in the future at the tip of the pen they can add your eraser and you can just like use it like a normal pencil
you can also set
it's not my medium like i don't think i'm ever gonna be able to make a full drawing on a phone but i've seen people do such great things with these things so uh these things works with a lot of programs for from what i tested out
anything else about this
i really like that
it has a lot of buttons to customize and i think having many buttons is important if you're gonna use this for art especially because while you're drawing you will need to undo a lot and redo and flip the canvas and then zoom out or zoom in and um that's great
i spent like i don't know one hour in it one hour and a half but that's like after i got used to it and how it was feeling i am not used to drawing with graphic tablets anymore
i'm gonna tell you some advantages or disadvantages that i have in mind i'm gonna start with the good parts and then end with the bad ones which aren't too many
actually this is a very good tablet for someone that is starting out in this medium like digital art you can use it on digital paintings or animation or even like photo editing
how do you write
and she was like
and they're using illustration programs to show us and make us understand new knowledge which is great in my opinion so the potential of this tablet is amazing because one it comes at a great price
if you'd make me choose between a wacom into a small tablet and this one i would choose the xp pen one over the wacom one anytime and the pen from it
i tried it on
it's probably just me but if you're fine with drawing on a phone then congrats you're a god in art and that is pretty much it because i don't see anything bad about this tablet so conclusions
three great diversity
you can use it as a art teacher or a simple teacher or a student or in the animation or just make art with it or even as a photographer or if you are just a hobbyist and you want to try some illustration 4.
it works on both pc and phone or tablet that feature i think will be useful for other people and not me because as i said before i am not used to drawing on a phone and i will never be okay
so another product of my conclusion is that if you're looking for something more professional like a screen tablet or a more professional graphical tablet like an intros pro from wacom
there's a promotion so if you want to check my description down below you're going to find a link to that and a code that they give to me as a gift for you so go ahead and check that out
i guess if you're looking for a new tablet but if you're like not interested in their offer or their brand which i doubt because they're really good you can look at huion or wacom but wacom is very expensive and i don't know why you would do that because exi pen is very close to the same quality as wacom has so
i guess bye
so i wanted to see if this tablet is able to do what the more expensive tablets do and see if it doesn't sacrifice too many features and that it's worth the money now
which is going to give you a 171 ppi which is going to be good enough especially if you haven't been exposed to very high density displays then it's going to look really good on the other hand
then this is going to look very pixely and you're going to see a lot of the pixels in the text and in the app icons and in a lot of parts of the tablet now this does have a quad core 1.3 gigahertz processor and it also has 8 gigabytes of internal memory that you can expand up to 128 gigabytes which is great
now all that aside
you can't really expect much but since it does have a matte black back made of plastic it does make it look a little bit more expensive than what it actually is
you get a ton of smudges on this device especially if you get annoyed by those then this isn't going to be good for you and i found myself cleaning this every time i finished using the tablet
now oddly enough
so you got all those functions up there and then on the right hand side of the tablet we do have a little slit so that we can put in the micro sd card more importantly than all that is of course the software and this does come with fire os 5 which is amazon's latest fire os software now
it's definitely less sluggish and a lot more quick and responsive and it's also a lot more easy and simple to use so anyone can pick this up and know how to use it immediately
the first thing that you're greeted with is home where you have all your apps and everything that you use to the left side is the recent which is all your recently opened items and then we got books video games shop apps music audio book and newsstand and within all those you can of course search for new stuff that you're looking for and easily play that or open that directly from there now
hulu hbo ted and a ton of new games that are coming out for android are coming out for fire os as well which is really good so we do get goat simulator crossy road hearthstone and those are all like really big games right
we got amazon video of course amazon music kindle books amazon photos and a bunch of other apps we of course do have the camera app so you can actually use this to take pictures
i remember owning a ds as a kid and having that camera on there and it was a really bad camera but always use it to take pictures of the things and add doodles to it and they actually included that functionality
as i mentioned i tried that one out first and that one worked perfectly just as you'd expect the only somewhat of a lag that i experienced was right at the beginning when you open the game
lastly i played hearthstone for about an hour and one session and that did actually heat up the tablet the top of the tablet and i just wanted to mention that even though it does happen to most tablets and smartphones nowadays
it'll pretty much last you a full day of mixed use so if you read a book then watch a tv show and then maybe play like tetris or something like that
then you're going to get it to last a whole day but if you're going to play some hearthstone for extended periods of times or anything like that then you're only going to get it to last three or four hours now
the other thing is that if you're using this for nothing graphic intensives so if you're just like reading books and browsing the web then you're not going to have any issues with getting that battery to last a couple days because the standby time on this is actually really good
now if you're not in the market for a 50 tablet you might be wondering well who exactly is a 50 tablet for and actually this has a lot of people that can benefit from this tablet
we got the elderly
which usually don't really go for any tablets and if you're going to get them a tablet or you know as a gift this might be a good tablet to start off since it doesn't really matter if they drop it
so if you're a parent and you don't want your kids to use the ipad that you have or the nexus that you have and don't want them to potentially break that then
and you also get kindle free time which is something that most other tablets don't offer and you can limit the use and select what apps you want your kids to use and that's actually really great now
but it's definitely doable
you can't just immediately scroll the new york times as soon as you load it so you just have to wait a few seconds for all the pictures and everything to load up
the one other complaint that i have is that you know the plastic isn't the best but of course this is again 50 and then the front display is quite glary so if you're in a room with a lot of light or sunlight then your content isn't going to be very easy to see so you do have to make sure you're in the right lighting conditions to enjoy your content in the best possible way
one thing that i did want to note is that this does come with special offers which are little ads every time that you open the kindle and that's not a big of an issue for me
i kind of like having a different wallpaper there every time that i open the kindle but if you do have a problem then you would have to pay another fifteen dollars for the tabloid to get it without those offers but i kind of highly recommend the offers
what a 50 tablet now looks like and it's kind of impressive and hopefully this kind of paves way to other cheap tablets and more affordable ones that don't cost 500 600 or a thousand dollars so aside from that
Amazon fire seven tablet
this is actually
I'm kind of diggin
these lighter colors here
I was never really into the bright yellows and bright blues that they had in the previous generation so I'm glad to see it kind of toned down in this version so as for sound we get a single speaker output
no stereo on the 7-inch version micro SD card slot good up to a 512 gigabyte card and now this can be used as internal or external storage on the top of the unit we have our power button micro USB for power in a small pinhole microphone 3.5 millimeter audio jack for those headphones and our volume rocker so like I mentioned Amazon
and that's good up to a 512 gigabyte card as for connectivity 802 11 a B G and n doesn't say anything about AC Wi-Fi but I am picking up my 5 gigahertz Network
I'd say somewhere around the five-hour mark the first thing I did when I got this tablet was try to install Google Play and luckily it does work if you follow my guide for the older 7 inch or the 8 inch it works with this one also
I'm going to be running some benchmarks testing some native Android gaming video playback and emulation so I had originally planned to run a bunch of benchmarks on here but unfortunately a lot of them just would not run so first up we have Geekbench 4 pro with a single core score of 638 multi core 1735
I couldn't get slingshot to work and we scored a 3900 and I'm sure if I was able to run some other benchmarks on here we'd get lower scores also so this is on the very low-end scale of the Android devices in 2019
I've ever seen this
it actually runs really good on this little tablet this is the Pocket Edition and it's been optimized over the years so it does work on a lot of different devices
I set up some dynamite here just to give it a little test and it's gonna bring it to pretty much a halt but as soon as the Dynamite's done we're back to playing at normal speed so mine
fire 7 tablet
this is definitely not gonna play any 4k content but I'm gonna go right here and everything loads up fine so you shouldn't have any trouble with YouTube on this thing and finally we'll test out Netflix
unfortunately n64 is gonna be really hit or miss on a tablet like this this is Goldeneye double-oh-seven and it's just not going to cut it for this game but there are in 64 games
seven tablet is $49.99
Amazon Prime day
as that's why they're $49.99 and they go on sale for $40 all the time updates over time are gonna help a little bit with performance but don't expect a massive game
I did experience some app crashing using higher-end games from the Google Play Store like I said you can sideloading here and that has to do with the one gigabyte of ram that this ships with I really wish they would have added an extra 512 megabytes or an extra gig would have made this tablet a lot better
Netflix Hulu prime video
you could even install
it was a video
it'd be really cool
thanks for watching you
a 7-inch tablet sir phone and according to the specs of these tablets a 7 inch LCD touchscreen 16 gigabyte with micro SD and actually I only have one gigabytes of memory internal memory a one gig of internal memory and but you can add external memory card of up to 16 gigabytes
you need to charge
I'm gonna show on this video fields pictures taken on the camera of this videos that you can actually turn look at what comes in the box is USB charging and a charger adapter and user manual and also inside other parts comes with a $10 off on online ordering groceries
ok so you can use a coupon to shop your groceries on Walmart online and also a promo code for up to $10 to use it on one more a books ok and of course I use terminal and this is the 7 inch tablet
everyone's use so far and before and I wanna show you the languages that you can use on this tablet so I wanna power on okay the professor of digital is 1.3 and the new where one is 1.6 so that's that's not too bad
I mean tablet and on this video gonna go with you the camera so you can see their videos and pictures basically basically it's an Android so you can use every single app
is there any other
so it's not bad it's really good and so every time you open a application probably gonna take out some three to eight seconds to open it because of the 1.3 processor so just so you know and these tablets already connected on an internet or Wi-Fi so about it depends on your internet connection the they also can help you help out to load any one two three or I see okay and let's go to the camera so the camera doesn't have any splash on it
according to the weather
okay self timer
and on till flicker
watched the video so you can actually zoom in or some out this camera but it's kind of hard to control the world's own okay and the camera has a stop
any you want to take a picture or you can choose a video or just move the screen to change picture or video and so in every picture you are able to actually edit the picture as well and share the picture from here to a social media and from here you can change different backgrounds can make it black and white give more texture to the picture from here and save a copy and also you can crop the picture as well so ok
Dahlia for your kid
just to train them how to take care of stuff and then later on you come buy a Samsung Galaxy Tab tablet or your child okay tailor to my video let me know if you have any other question or did you say any information that
I missed to mention here and I wanna I have a tutorial on how to talk to reset this tablet or even in case you forgot your password pin or pattern also
I have to tell you how to disable talkback or voice assistant or how to use it also so let me know you have any questions and please subscribe to my channel so we can
thanks so much
drawing tablet for free they contacted me on twitter one night to ask me if i could review one of their products and i said sure why not so here we are anyways
these are two adapters
in case you want to connect the tablet to your phone and this thing has two uses for changing pen nibs and holding your pen in place when you want to put it down so moving on this
this box also included this artist's glove which is for the purpose of your hands and not directly touch the tablet and as you can see it's for both right-handed and left-handed people
the good thing about this is that when you're drawing and you don't want to really look away from the screen you can tell which button you're pressing based on how it feels look closely
i'd like to mention though is that it makes quite a loud scratchy noise whenever i draw and then i found out that it's just because of the screen protector so it might be a completely different case for other tablets
and this is the Dell Streak 7 Android tablet on t-mobile now t-mobile Rd has the Samsung Galaxy Tab which is a fine 7 inch Android tablet but this guy has two things that are better it has HSPA+ 4G on t-mobile's network and it has a Tegra 2 dual-core processor running at one gigahertz but other than that we have to say we do like the TAM better and we'll get into that in a bit first
now you have the streak fly for comparison they both have that kind of attractive tapered corner while the Dell Streak 5 feels like a very high quality piece with a lovely sharp display and a metal back
we assume you have to use a pry tool to yank this thing off which is not something that you want to do at home for the most part that means that the twenty seven hundred and fifty million battery is sealed inside
and this side
we have a door
the street weighs about a pound and I it's not too bad to haul at one hand as I'm doing right now and it's about the same size as the Galaxy Tab will compare them here just a little bit longer which gives it more of a widescreen effect
conferencing and it does come with quick software for video conferencing over Wi-Fi or 4G your choice or 3g2 of course and here we have Froyo 2.2 with Dells stage UI which are a selection of large widgets and virtually the customizations we saw on the Dell Streak 5 inch with Google OS 1.6 where you had great customized dialer that integrated your contacts and better calendar and address bug apps
GPS to do that
Facebook or Twitter
but you can set of two instances of this widget one for Facebook and one for Twitter and then you get nice little status updates right here on the screen
which shows album covers
once you've gone to a website you get a thumbnail of the web page and you can just tap to go directly to that web page so that's the Dells stage UI otherwise this is pretty much vanilla
you can see here
five is the standard
so you've got your standard back button here your menu button and your home button but you do not have that search button or as you can bring up search on screen in terms of performance
this is very fast
the Quadra benchmark was about 1500 which is pretty good but not amazing but then again quadrant really isn't optimized yes for dual-core CPUs nor are some of the other benchmarks
Linpack we averaged about 37 at 38 mega flops but experientially this feels a lot faster than the Galaxy Tab and we don't see those strange little pauses and things and we see on the TAM
Bismol on this and that's not very good for a tablet a phone you can move around and put right underneath your your face wherever you need it to be to get the best viewing angle
you want to put it down on the table while you're eating and read it and you'll discover wow you really just can't see that thing unless you move it directly underneath yourself so that's a big shame compared to the Galaxy Tab now this is $50 less than the Galaxy
Tab and we know that Dell was going for a budget conscious consumer friendly product here and despite the fact they've been making fairly high end things with the Dell Venue Pro and with the original streak on AT&T
this one was not meant to be as high in the device but the problem is when there's only a $50 price difference with contract between this and the Galaxy
Tab we really have a hard time recommending this over the tab that said there are worse things for example there are a lot of budget Android tablets out there at Best
and very grainy looking so there are a lot worse things than the Dell you know our only complaint really is about the display quality and every other way this is quite high end you've got 3G 4G you have Wi-Fi a total Evan BG on this Bluetooth a GPS that works with Google Maps and 16 gigs of internal storage
of course you can use an SD card to expand that further so in all the respects this is a fairly high spec product bundled software on here includes whether you've got demo version of asphalt on
this has on demand full TV episodes and it has some streaming content as well so here we are on t-mobile TV which is pretty much the same at AT&T is live TV in terms of the content
that's on your an interface so you can see it it auto scroll through there you can pick something that you like right so here we are and we're playing some streaming content right now from music
TV channel
it looks pretty good actually and this is overcame all those 4G HSPA+ networks we're not using Wi-Fi this advantage of t-mobile has because 18 G's versions app makes you use Wi-Fi to use any content whatsoever
it's a little bit quickie on this a little bit slow but we've been noticing that a couple of Android handsets so we can't really blame the del so much as I think my B TV needs to continue to do some more tweaking for the Android platform that's one way you can get streaming content on there so here we are in the demo version of asphalt 5 GT
Android phone right now
Flash content is very good this does have Flash 10.1 for true flash playback in web browser which is nice not the easiest to play one-handed but the pyramid softens running very nicely all right so that's asphalt 5 PT running on the Elm Street 7 now
we're checking out
obviously text is going to be bigger and we have pin to zooming here very fast and very fluid and we have an embedded video in the New York Times home page
so we're going to test out flash playback pretty cool toys and now we've switched over to full-screen mode now the New York Times doesn't use a very high quality video
but what we can do is we always provide links in the following description of the video from where you will be able to find the updated prices of each product mentioned in the description
so if you look for the up-to-date price information just make sure of watching the video till the end and click on the link to find out the current price and which product will be the best for you at number one

you also get a micro usb charging cable and the mains plugin as well and you also get a spare screen protector as well user manuals here as well that comes with it and the tablet itself now
now you can switch on by pressing this and the volume buttons is there as well and if you look at it here that he also takes a 3.5 millimeters headphone jack as well and that's where the charging port is the memory card
okay so let this load up so i can show you the rest of the features it has a built-in 3000 mah battery capacity as well that gives you around up to eight hours of usage time
go that design here
you need parental control
you got battery apps
you can pull
it has everything that a kid would want and it has a good body as well with a good and protective case that would prevent it from getting damaged that easily
it's really really thin
you also have some docking contacts as well so if you want to get their keyboard attachment for this you can and you can run this like a full on android based laptop which is really really cool
you can also charge this with usbc which makes it future proof and makes your life a little bit easier because you'll only need one cable in your house which is really really cool
i think some of the other cool things is of course the cpu it is octa tor and octa-core so basically you are able to go and run just about anything you throw at this
and you know what
why not
maybe you could stream to your chromecast and have a movie going because why the heck not but i think i think one of the most interesting things is those docking connectors because you can have this run like a keyboard so if you are considering something you know cheaper than your apple's products then this is probably the way to go because you can have a keyboard you can have all of android at your fingertips on a 1280x800 display
you also get an eight megapixel rear camera so if you do want to capture something you want to be that uncle who always has the ipad at the concert then this is probably the way to go all right guys go ahead and check this out in the link below if you guys enjoyed this video absolutely like and don't forget to subscribe
inch internet tablet
it's a 10.1
inch internet tablet
it can produce
it has bluetooth 4.0
ok now we'll look at the side of the tablet and some of the ports it has it has a mock has a back button as a power port an HDMI mini port adapter not included
it has a micro
this one has over-the-air update and local update so if you'd like to go to their site and download the update then you can do that but it's much easier just to do it online
okay that's new
this tablet is very Google oriented you have to have a Google account to do most of the stuff or it keeps popping up asking for it they just have Google now
YouTube works very well
I've also installed Netflix
which works really good
it works very well so $10 speaker from Big Lots but that's a little bit of demonstration of YouTube and like I said this it's pretty responsive I mean there's no lag I mean every once in a while it will freeze up but that's usually when you're switching between applications and you know it's best to try to keep those cleaned off
it has 1 gigabyte of RAM 4 gigabytes of internal memory that you can't expand with a micro SD card to 32 gigabytes now getting back to the tablet one thing I would like to note
how important this is on tablets nowadays having so much connectivity to your car and many speakers and stuff like that this is going to be greatly used with this tablet because the speaker like I said is it's on the back and it is very tinny and even at high levels you're still you still don't have very much especially if you're in a crowded room or something like that and you're trying to watch something you're you're not going to be able to hear it also to the screen it's very reflective very reflective when
I will stand outside
it was unusable
often thank you
hey guys this
US dollars so it's on par with the price of the new Amazon Fire HD 10 and I really want to see how it stacks up against the competition now it personally never reviewed any Venky o-- tablets or projectors but I have seen a lot of their stuff listed on Amazon especially they're cheaper tablets
I noticed with the listing on this tablet is it doesn't list exactly what CPU it has but it does state that it's a 1.6 gigahertz octa-core CPU with three gigs of RAM
and that's something that's always bugged me about these cheaper tablets or cheaper electronics in general most of the time these manufacturers will not list the CPU make and model because either one
we get the tablet user manual our charging brick and our USB type-c cable and that's one big plus that I'm already seeing with this tablet it's using USB type-c and it's not using micro USB like a lot of the cheaper tablets still do in 2020 now there's a couple things I notice about this tablet right out of the box first up
it's pretty heavy now
I'm not going to hold the weight against this but the second thing I noticed straight out of the box is the bezels as you can see they are pretty thick for 2020 standards but overall it's a hundred and fifty dollar tablet and this is something I could get used to
power button and two pinhole microphones up like I mentioned when I purchased this the exact CPU make and model was not listed in the description but I went ahead and installed I 264 from the Google Play Store and here are the specs
at 1.2 for the GPU it's rocking the power via rogue GE 83 22 very similar to the GPU in the fire stick 4k we have three gigabytes of LP ddr3 RAM a 10.1 inch IPS display at 1200 by 1920 s
why a lot of these companies are using them they are cheaper 32 gigabytes of internal storage plus a microSD card slot good up to 128 gigabytes 802 dot 11
with this
so it's fairly no
it is a stock
Android 9.0 version
on this I mean except for the Google Apps so it's a basic stock rom and it works pretty well here but there is one major issue that I can already see on screen now
I believe it's running at 50 Hertz and I have seen this before in Cheaper tablets the first thing I noticed was the flicker on camera but then when I started drawing the apps up here it just look as smooth as a 60 Hertz display would look now this could be due to how it's set up inside of Android and the screen itself could very well be a 60 Hertz display but unfortunately it's only running at 50 Hertz so you're really only gonna see a maximum of 50 FPS out of anything you test on this machine
we're only at 50
in the top
this could be noticeable to some people and in my opinion this was a big screw-up on the manufacturers part putting the refresh rate aside the tablet does function quite well now viewing videos streaming them from Netflix Hulu YouTube
everything works great here
but you're gonna be stuck at that 50 Hertz and now that I've said something you'll be able to see the flashing the whole time but everything loads up quick with that AC Wi-Fi enabled I have a pretty decent connection here haven't had any trouble streaming from YouTube Netflix
I have with the HD 10 single core 1383 multi 51:37 so in single core and multi-core performance the fire HD 10 will beat this tablet out everyday but what about GPU performance for that I ran 3dmark sling shot and unfortunately the s 30 does not support Vulcan with this version of Android for OpenGL we scored at 577 and on the HD 10 on 1151 so theoretically the HD 10 beats this out in gaming performance also and finally I ran the antutu benchmark on the s 30 total score 90,000 73 on the HD 10 120 1516 and
it frees up every once in a while and there's a lot of effects on-screen or lots of characters and that's really what this games about so it's not a very enjoyable experience and I was really hoping for better performance in this game especially with all of the settings as low as they could go next up
we have minecraft now
I saw it drop down to 12 fps so I guess we're gonna drop the settings down as low as they could go with Minecraft Pocket Edition so I've turned all the fancy graphics off I've dropped the chunks down to six and we're getting 49 FPS
Hertz display so
you're gonna notice it
dropped down into the 20s but this is a playable game on a machine like this even with the settings jacked all the way up after all this is just minecraft and just because
Call of Duty mobile
it's actually running pretty decent here on the lowest settings but I do notice some input delay with the touchscreen and it's definitely giving me some issues here but overall I mean the gameplay itself looks pretty decent
if it was much cheaper it might be a decent buy but either way we're still working with that 50 Hertz display and that really really bugs me so I personally can't recommend this s30 tablet
I would much rather have the Amazon Fire HD 10 with better performance even though it's not running a stock version of Android there are ways to install Google Play on it very easily and it's a pretty decent performer in emulation and native Android gaming and devices like this or what draw people away from the Android tablet market
I mean there's really no point it will run NES SNES Atari NeoGeo FBA it'll do CPS one two and three just fine but it's really gonna be limited because of that screens refresh rate
thanks for watching you
hey everybody its lines
we had a technician come out to repair a phone here on site so you can see exactly what the process is like and if you got a cracked screen or something and don't have the time to get it fixed
LAN TV you'll get $20 off your next repair pretty good deal and it gets better with that coupon and I want to thank them for their support of the channel
and the tablet we're looking at today came in free of charge from gearbest.com however all the opinions you're about to hear are my own and nobody has reviewed what you're about to see before it was uploaded so let's get to the review so let's take a look now at the hardware when I review some of these Chinese brands
I was surprised by the build quality from chewy here and not in a good way because we've looked at a lot of their other devices in the past and they've always been decent not spectacular but decent
the screen was coming up here a bit on the top here so we kind of snapped it back together when it arrived and it didn't feel like a shipping issue
it's got an 8.4
inch display it's IPS with pretty decent viewing angles 2560 by 1600 so it does have a slightly better resolution than some other tablets around this price point although I've been very satisfied with a 1080p display on an 8 inch tablet like this so I don't know if you necessarily need all that much resolution and the display is running very cold and that the whites are a little bluer than I normally like so my preference is a warmer display
81-73 quad-core processor so it is relatively up-to-date in that regard 64 gigabytes of on-board storage which is good and 4 gigabytes of RAM which is also good and this one is running Android 7.0
not much for controls and add-ons here you do have an SD card slot on the top here a micro SD card slot that will take cards up to 128 gigabytes
here a micro
USB port for charging I don't believe it supports fast charging and that is pretty much it for its controls along with the volume rocker over here on the side
let's see how it performs so let's kick things off with some web browsing every going to go over here to nasa.gov one of the nice things about the tablet given that it does have 4 gigs of ram is that you'll notice pretty snappy performance when you're jumping back and forth between apps because it is able to keep more things in the background perhaps than you might otherwise have on a tablet with a lesser amount of available
RAM to you but overall feels like it's going through the web pages here pretty nicely so I think you'll be able to have a decent web browsing experience although you will have a slightly bluish kind of hue to the screen
let's take a look at YouTube now and see how that loads up here so I'm loading it up for the first time so you might see a little bit of a delay on these apps when you first load them and then if they're in memory they'll load up a little bit quicker so we can play my weekly wrapup video from last night here and go through this again this speakers on the back here it sounds very tinny so if you are looking to listen to music or something or even your youtube videos you definitely want to plug in some headphones to that
headphone jack here
but but so far
I would expect out of a $200 tablet so let's take a look at some game playing on the device we've got minecraft loaded up here and it seems like it's running pretty decently the frame rates pretty good and the resolution of course looks nice
Lenovo tablet we looked at last week that that one was running at 1080p versus the resolution on this one so you might see a little bit of slowdown here or there but I think from the game playing experience it should be just fine
emulation shouldn't be an issue but this tablet is not powerful enough to do something like the GameCube emulator dolphin or something more high-end but I think a lot of 16-bit games and 8-bit games should function well on here maybe even the original PlayStation we also ran our usual benchmark the 3dmark sling shot test
Lenovo tab for eight
I think you'll get a decent gaming experience out of here but we have yet to find an 8 inch tablet that's as powerful as their now unfortunately defunct Nvidia k1 and before we close out
the pictures are ok
so by and large

I'll put it in
port comes with a charger here while it doesn't and it also comes with a USB to micro USB cable I don't believe it mentions it in the instructions but you can charge it through the micro USB port in fact that's my preference because all my other devices charge that way and then you don't have to worry about keeping this around and having it somewhere handy because a lot of people have these for their phones and other tablets so just keep that in mind
up and down
SD card slot
I believe is is plastic and I'm gonna try to get out of the way here you can see it is very reflective so if you've got it any light behind you whatsoever it's gonna be a little bit difficult to see so you're gonna hold it at an angle and I'm gonna show you how the screen looks
but there's there's nothing really holding on to it there but most everything well actually everything is still open the the camera front and back the microphone the the power button here all the power port micro USB ports
USB port right there Oh headphone jack one thing that I wish the old on the speaker of course one thing I wish they would have done is perhaps have this covered the memory card because your kids can just yank that right out of there without any problem so had they covered that you could have just pulled this back
I'm not going to really show you the screen because you're just gonna see me like it's a mirror but I think they did a nice job overall so let me go to a darker room and show off the screen to you and some of the software that comes with it right so I've moved to a darker room
pretty much straight on
it actually looked better in person than it does in the video here but as you move it side to side you can just see that huge shift so if you turn it this way you're almost getting a negative of the colors and if you turn it this way it just gets very washed out so holding it in this orientation for me just really doesn't work because I'm always tilting it a little bit and everything just shifts pretty badly if I hold it in this orientation try to get it to shift screen there
it's not that bad
it looks like it's getting washed out in the image but it really isn't but this is when that's really washed out and now the negative colors if you shift it that way so certainly not the best screen in the world but you're not paying much of a price premium for this
it's gone down about 10% so let me show off some of the features of it so I've turned the brightness down little bit because I went into what I want to show you which is kid mode and the screen was completely washed out
Android software built into it but it also has this thing called kid mode which launches zoodles which comes with it and it takes a little bit of time to load it and then once it pulls it up it'll have tiles with
so it has things that cause games art books mail and then favorites and the favorites are just something that if your kids play it often they'll show up there now
you're missing some so
they can
I mean a lot of these are locked and they're locked until you pay extra for them so it comes with one built in which is the three little pigs so it's they essentially are reading the book to your child
I mean it's got the words here very small print and then they they read along with it in the video so they also have video mail which you have to set up as an adult before you can let your kids do it
which initially there's nothing there and then if they try to get out of this they can't yeah because if they try to close it you have to enter a code and I just picked a code by the way that it says
enter your birthday year
google it smart enough to block all that so the kid mode is fairly safe but it doesn't have a whole lot in it for them to do so you may want to get your own software for them
that don't look bad
viewing is pretty poor
it's not a Maxis Lee slow but again you you get what you pay for and you're not paying a lot for it so it's it's something that if you just want a fairly inexpensive tablets not a bad choice
I think it's comfortable
I don't want you to go into thinking that you're gonna get a high end tablet for a lot less money that you're going to get something equivalent to a nexus 7 or an iPad
I'm showing you the back of it so you don't see a mirror reflecting on my face so if you go in with the right level of expectations you understand what you're paying for
I'll be sculpting Hyun's mascot who young buddy in blender so this tablet sells on Amazon for around four hundred and fifty US dollars so keep in mind that depending on where you buy it from you might not always get the same accessories but mine came with the following so of course
we have the tablet itself an adjustable stand which allows you to have the tablets tilted towards you at different angles for better comfort the PW 507 battery less digital pen
a cleaning cloth
we'll get into that later in the video some stickers so you can conveniently label your hotkeys which is pretty cool a QuickStart guide that has all the info you need to get the tablets up and running an artist glove
its own it needs to be hooked up to a computer via an HDMI cable and a USB cable so if you have an older laptop you want to make sure you have an HDMI port
the tablet has six
the display screen is protected by a solid anti glare glass panel so the first thing that struck out to me when I picked up the tablet is the build quality
the back
it seems to be made of aluminium and although it is very thin and lightweight you know it definitely feels solid the rubber pads allow it to firmly grip the tablet and prevent it from going anywhere when I first plugged in the tablet
at first glance everything seemed to work just fine without any drivers needing to be installed but then I noticed that the pressure sensitivity the Express keys and tilt recognition didn't respond of course for those to work
Huyen software allows you to customize the tablet to your liking you can adjust the sensitivity level and mess around with the pressure curves and I could definitely see myself using that in the future
but if for some reason the cursor is offset from where the tip of the pen touches the screen it can easily be recalibrated with a few clicks so usually
I can easily orbit pan zoom and save my work without having to use the mouse or the keyboard so I don't actually have that much experience with tablets is all up until now
the display is laminated which means the air gap between the display and the front panel is removed this considerably reduces internal reflections and since the pen is so physically close to the display
so it's always good to have a few spare ones so you can get nibs that are made of a different material and that have a different shape each nib feels different to the touch
for instance some nibs feel more rough like drawing with a pencil on paper others might have a smoother feel to them like drawing on a smooth piece of plastic now
the clip just makes it easier to pull the name of the pen like I said in the beginning of the video to test out the tablet will be creating who Yun's mascots in blender so enjoy this little time-lapse of me sculpting hair grooming and texture painting our little character here so overall I am really happy with this tablet so this is obviously a sponsored review but I do genuinely love this tablet
I definitely plan on using it as my personal tablet and I already have a bunch of project in which I'm going to use it so would I recommend this tablet absolutely so if you're interested check the description for more info
yeah that'll do it for this video so if you liked it leave a like if you have any suggestions or ideas for me to do in future videos let me know in the description and I shall see you guys next time
it is the latest
you're going to be doing a lot of reading on this if you're going to buy a Kindle product you're probably into the Amazon Amazon ecosystem their books and also their Prime instant videos which we have showing right now for watching video
OS and they
I always thought that this was kind of a half-baked thing though the way the Kindle Fire operated we saw these giant icons of arbre resolution ugly we still have giant icons here but not at least
there's a record
it doesn't have any suggestions as Amazon's web browser they call that silk as always but you might want other search applications and location-based applications so suggesting something there now and then we have something that looks more familiar to her used to using Android and even iOS tablets as you drag down
Kindle Fires have never been real fast navigating the UI and I was wondering that was because they were not exactly using cutting-edge CPUs inside Arfa was the operating system
well now
so it's hard to say who is ever to blame before but this is finally something that's nice and zippy and fancy we can switch between all of our tabs very quickly get to our content
but it means that they're hoping of course that you've bought a lot of content from them a lot of books so everything that you buy and haven't even download will always show up as the cloud tab and you can look at what's actually on device by tapping on device you can go back and forth so it makes it very easy to get stuff that you purchase with them are you put on your Amazon Cloud
I don't have anything I've transferred to the device is telling me right here go ahead and use your USB cable and put some on there if you want but that doesn't stop me from playing something and listen to those speakers as always
you're going to hear on a tablet here better than some notebooks in fact and I expect the 8.9 inch will probably be a little bit louder given that has a little bit more room for speakers so who knows anyway very good for watching movies
my test is always using my exercise extra cycle indoors which is not the quietest machine in the world and my laptop's have to plug in external speakers with the Kindle Fire HDX
we've got bevels all the way around clearly because they wanted to have the bevel for the speaker so they wouldn't rest on the table and to make it easier to get to the back facing controls here
they really dip down
I still tend to have to turn around and look because I'm just not used to having my controls back there yet but if you grab around your finger you'll feel them and it's pretty obvious which is power and which is volume
just use a standard
Android file transfer
this is running
headphone and microphone
and there's a front-facing camera up top 720p and that is your video camera and you can download skype and install that if you want to get to all of your settings nothing too much has changed there
Brighton is very bright
despite by the way we have this turned up because we have a whole lot of ambient light in the room but I think in most cases nobody's going to be running this in maximum brightness unless you're outdoors speaking of outdoors speaking of glare it does glare
it's a glossy display
if we tap on that this is not exactly instant pretty close within 15 seconds or so you can get support online from Amazon folks and it's one way video chat you can see them
you can hear them
so if you're thinking about giving this to mom or grandma or grandpa they're really techno noobs and you don't want them calling you all the time about how to use the fire they can hit that made a button and bother somebody else and if you need access to all settings right here we have them
in fact here
Android isn't any characterization whatsoever certainly not like the Kindle Fire does but that's a topic for another Smackdown but just for those you want to see what the differences physically there it is like most every tablet on the market
that sort of thing
so what's inside
I want a cut-rate CPU but one of last year's slower models in this case we have cutting-edge stuff here we have the 2.2 gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 CPU with the Drina 330 graphics currently
no 330 graphics
there's a whole lot of casual games on the Kindle app store and the killer 3d games and other than Gameloft titles not so much but expect that to change now it has 2 gigs of RAM inside again
the 16 gig
so hey you might want more storage inside if you want to load your own content but I think for a lot of people though they are going to rely on cloud server as either putting their own content up on Cloud Drive or using Amazon's own Prime video books that you buy magazines that you buy from Amazon directly on their
which means you're going to see an ad on the screen every time you wake it up and which you can ignore or you can get real excited about if you want
there actually is a link to offers up top so actually if you saw an offer something you were interested in buying you can tap over there and see sometimes have coupons for example that are good on Amazon
just add a hundred dollars so you're starting at 3:29 for example going all the way up to 409 if you want the 4G LTE model all them have dual band Wi-Fi a total eleven b/g/n with MIMO
so you get good
Wi-Fi reception on these
Evernote you can get
I've done that and Oh shame on me I've even side loaded the Nook application which works just fine on this by the way but I haven't gotten Google Play working so forth if you want to learn more about that go to xda-developers our android cowboy.com
Google Play muse
we'll play books
Google Play magazines
that's not a problem
whatever get what's over
Google playing movies books all that stuff networks so you can get content in those ways it's just the Google Play Store for applications that right now you don't access to at least not without rooting and in fact here we are in Google Play magazines right
we'll start that one
display is just perfect for that and even if we go off angle other than seeing reflections viewing angles are very good on this so certainly a lovely experience for reading for those you who like reading off of LCDs versus Ian's displays and now our magazine has loaded here
you can double tap on it to fill the screen if you want just like that and we can bring up navigation for the magazines as well that that's stayed pretty much the same bookmarks here and here's our Browse feature
we can go through all the pages of the magazine and browse quickly so obviously this has been a very nice fast fluid device so far also pretty stable as well and that's borne out by the synthetic benchmarks
3.3 D mark
that's very good
so this is a fast device is the first Kindle Fire that we've seen that hasn't been kind of sluggish not impressive in terms of underlying specs for the web browser
I've just touched them
I you may or may not do this depending on how savvy are but I did sideload YouTube so we can actually and this is if you happen to sideload the YouTube player
Android devices and it works just fine - OH install so you complete with ads so you get the idea and yes you can turn it over and play it in landscape mode - that's for the more adventurous of you but as you saw it's not too too hard to actually side load that stuff and now we're going to test out asphalt 8 a really beautiful 3d driving game very demanding one at that to see how it plays certainly if we can do this it can do
Angry Birds real easy
that is beautiful looking
I don't anyway
so that's asphalt eight on the Kindle Fire HDX 7-inch so who's the Kindle Fire HDX 7-inch four or for that matter 8.9 inch I would say yeah first off size-wise if you're mostly reading ebooks
I know I do
also magazines can be a little bit easier to read without having to zoom into reading v/o to actually read the actual article and so just look at the pretty pictures in the magazine
this is one of the least expensive ones so is the Nexus 7 2013 edition and as ever with the Kindle Fire products or all the Kindle products this is really best for those who would like to consume Amazon services
and there are a lot of you out there those of you prime accounts so you got a lot of free streaming movies and TV shows those you have a lot of Kindle books like to buy from their magazines and magazine subscriptions and so on because it's super easy to consume on here and honestly the experience especially when watching videos on this is very nice and turnkey you want something it's a TV series
so if you're really into prime this is the way to get it now for those who who need all-around tablet with access to the Google Play Store Google Maps the GPS rear-facing camera
Amazon stuff so that's the Kindle Fire HD it is available now as I said starting at 229 but you know how it goes when a new Kindle model comes out there they're selling it like crazy so you're probably at the place in order to wait but eventually you'll be able to get one easily and they're in stores like Best Buy too so if you want one go get it
why hello there
I've estimated because I got it in middle school as far as I remember and I've taken it to Egypt and back with me and I've taken it all around the place and this thing is a very durable awesome little tablet
I think are important selling points and if there any drawbacks that I've experienced I'm going to share those with you too so let's get started with the pen so I've also had by the way the companion to the Wacom companion 2 and the bamboo
I've tried the bamboo
basically as the one in the companion that comes with the companion - the one that comes with the companion - comes in a case and with extra nibs and stuff but that's one of the things that like
in comparison the nib on my um my friend's bamboo that I borrowed it was totally worn down even right when I got it and I don't know how much he's used it in stuff but it was clearly like at an angle cut like this basically and sharp and so
apparently you can go to replacement pack and put it on there but basically there was a right and left click or you could program it to whatever but there were you could click here and here and it was just one piece and
it feels right when you're pushing like if you push more to erase a bigger area then you know it feels it feels good and I don't know if the nib has a little bit of that but wouldn't it feels good to moving on to the tablet itself
I always transport this
it's it's crazy
and here
it's got these
I use that sometimes um I'm sure I could be making more utilizing these better but like the main functionality is the pen with the pressure sensitivity and the tilt and everything so let's talk about that pressure sensitivity great
I think the tilt um isn't the greatest the tilt doesn't feel as responsive as I would like and it's weird because you don't want to tilt things like this and this while you're drawing I mean maybe you do
and most of the brushes don't even use the tilt feature all the most brushes that I use so I'm not exactly that might be one feature where I'm like me
and it's tough too
it's not fraying or anything it's just a regular USB plug um and it's plug and play like I can start up Photoshop and then plug it in and it'll work I can plug it in and then start up Photoshop
I've never felt that it's either too long or too short like too short that I couldn't work with it how I wanted to or it's so long that it was getting in the way so I really like the length and the durability of it and I mean where it's let's see where it plugs in you know
you know what
I mean
my friends come
the whole
um which would
um and the pen
I'll mention that so the size right here this you just takes up the whole screen so if I go like this I've just drawn a line across the whole screen so if you get a bigger one what that allows you to do
I guess is get more arm motion in there as opposed to smaller wrist motions and I've heard that some people actually don't like this when I was working on the companion
tilt you know how you're supposed to and then using your your wrist you know resting your thing and kind of using your whole arm to get the fluid motions and I know that's the ideal way to to draw in to do art
I don't think that the smaller size really affects the performance that much but if you prefer a larger screen I mean I think it comes down to preference that's what I would say
um this works fine
you have any questions
what's up everybody
Tony here with a tech check and now that I've had a chance to give you my review of the most expensive and best tablet out on the market today
this is the van
Keogh matrix pad s30
I'm pretty excited to see how well this tablet works out especially because of the price and you can also pick it up on amazon.com right now and I will be putting a link in the description in case you guys want to pick one up yourself and if you guys like me you want to support my channel
that's pretty much it
let's cover a little power button and volume buttons on the top there's our 13 megapixel camera with the LED it's got the USB type-c there your little SD card slot and it actually does have a headphone jack and on the bottom
feel to it whenever you pick it up the buttons on the top here do feel like they're metal as well and the SIM card tray is also metal and then again you get that headphone jack and the USB type-c which is always a plus and if you are worried about cracking the screen they do have some glass screen protectors on Amazon that you can purchase for this tablet
I will be putting links in the description for those as well in case you guys want to check them out yourself now because this is an IPS screen and it's not OLED the LCD is backlit and because of that there's usually some light bleed around the corners
I'm in total darkness
it's pretty responsive
it's pretty smooth
it's probably not the smoothest out there but for the price and what you're getting there's really hardly any lag at all if there is any opening and closing applications is pretty quick
I had my brightness set to about half I turned it on at 98% around 7:20 a.m. and then I ran it down as far as I could down to 1% and I got about 8 hours of screen on time and the way that I tested that was I was streaming a YouTube video for the whole time that I had to tablet on so I was connected to Wi-Fi and I had my screen brightness at halfway
you can extend the battery life if you turn down the brightness so if you're in a darker environment you can definitely save a lot of battery if you turn down the brightness from 50% and if you don't need to use the Wi-Fi and you're just using you know local storage to watch videos that'll save you some battery life as but for the most part for everybody
that's pretty good now as far as the screen brightness goes the only thing that I wish it had was an ambient light sensor so whether you're in a really bright environment a super dark environment the screen brightness that do you set is always going to be the same
so let's go into these settings and I'll show you the amount of storage that you get right out of the box so this is supposed to have 32 gigs of internal storage and if we go into the storage here
the total is 32 gigs but you get about 22 to use right out of the box because some is already being used up by the system and you're only going to get about 22 gigs of actual usable storage
but the really nice thing is is if you put an SD card in here to expand your storage you can use it to expand the internal storage as well as set it up to be a portable storage that you can kind of pull out as if it was an external hard drive or something
it's not blurry
I think the pixel quality is definitely good enough for you to be able to comfortably watch 1080p videos and do some reading if you really needed to okay so here
you can definitely make out the text really easy to read and then if we switch it over to a reading portrait the text will get smaller but you can definitely easily read the text still even though it is a little smaller so you can see everything looks pretty smooth
that doesn't look jagged
I don't think you're gonna have to worry about it so I do think that the brightness is definitely good enough for you in most situations but just know that if it's in direct sunlight you might have a little problem seeing what's on the screen now as I said before this does have a 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi band and as you can see from the screen test here
this tablet works really
well it's pretty smooth for everything that you're going to do except for maybe some high res gaming so with that being said if you want to play games like pub G and Call of Duty you're going to have to lower the resolution down to its lowest setting to really make the game even playable the GPU in here just cannot handle a lot of high res games like pub G things like that call of duty you can play things like slither
it's just those higher end games that you're gonna have some problems with now while we're on that subject this is a hundred and fifty dollar tablet and you would not buy a hundred and fifty dollar a laptop and expect to use it for gaming
this tablet is works
there's no lag whatsoever
there is no lag
it's not going to give you the best experience because it's not on the highest resolution setting but if you really need to play it in a pinch you still can
and that's always really nice because batteries and heat do not mix well so you always want your tablet to be nice and cool so all in all what you're paying for this tablet it does definitely give you a lot
it's a nice tablet
brightness is definitely adequate and the build quality is really good so I definitely recommend if you guys want to pick this up for yourself or maybe as like a first tablet for a child definitely good again I will be putting a link in the description in case you guys want to pick this up yourself and if you guys like me and you want to support my channel please use that link because it helps me keep purchasing products do do reviews for you guys so
hey everybody its Brock
Android tablet center stack
I get some bad reflections here so I don't have to hold the camera back here a little bit or else you're gonna see my arm and all that stuff
I'm about 80% impressed
I do have a couple things I don't like about it but let's go through the things that I do like about it in the main features real quick here and you know
I actually added a 4G Wi-Fi connection that I stuck in the back and so it's always connected which is pretty neat so you can actually go and download whatever you want and it works unless you're out of data which
the sound isn't working
one of the things
I guess would be an SD card reader or the USB port which I don't have really hooked up to anything besides the hot spot and so it defaults to this
Ford can bus
in my opinion and those things actually work see not too bad but clicking on the camera thing doesn't do much without some more programming or god knows what they don't really go to detail about that and same can be said for the DVR function which you know it's not gonna function if you don't have lot of cameras right so here we go again
PM's does work as does the miles and file manager is pretty much the same story as the music and the other file you can get to the Android stuff you get to ringtones pictures do you
you can hook that stuff up and you can have functional navigation through the tablet which is pretty cool okay but if you already have navigation built into your truck you'll just use the factory nav which
like a tablet
you can do this
sometimes it won't
there's your factory now kind of bizarre right so they give you a navigation satellite antenna with a magnetic base which is nice you can mount inside here and it does a pretty good job of seeing its way out and actually the tablet nav works pretty awesome because you know
I mean it's just
it seems like a hair above the factory system and really the only people using the internet or be me being pulled over or you know my wife looking for something on the internet while
I'm driving
thanks for watching
[ __ ] like that and it turns out that um it really doesn't do enough justice to the tablet in terms of gameplay for also so in the past what I used to do was just give you guys a general like a first impression of each tablet product and it turns out that on in the long run
or some tablet
I did a first impression which turns out to be extreme like 180 degrees different from what the actual tablet gives you and yields so I think this kind of procedure of just giving you an idea as to what this tablet felt like after having used to stablish for about eight hours or plus
I'm going to be reviewing this as in ending and giving you some like points as to what I really liked and what they could have done better so yeah first of all before we even get to the tablet product itself
they the people who are dealing handling this like made a huge [ __ ] and drop something really really large and heavy onto it and that's why it made like a huge gaping hole into the into the Boston also and laid like a dent onto the tablet so it's probably not actually Penn's fault
they made a pretty good packaging there as a which when I was opening it it was really hard for me to get through and it still has a dent in it so if anything is not this company's also I wouldn't blame XP Penn for that
four rubber feet
this is a pen
I think it's 2.0
I can't really tell anyways on a USB receiver to this going back to the tab time this is really really nice tablet and on par with the CTO 480 in terms of like weight distribution
it feels like
I can't stress enough
it feels as if
I'm not going to like rent too much about the difference of the two but really really solid pen even much better than I'm pretty sure is way better than this
it became really slippery
so yeah it comes with this thing where if you it comes like this - this has a pin remover in the middle and these ten nibs are like stuck around like so
I don't exactly know why they decided to do this but I thought it's kind of interesting because this has some weight on it so you put it down and this is like a cap you twist it on and then now if it comes a pen rester holder or whatever they call it you can put it like so or you can even like put your tablet pen like so and it will stay on like that so there's that I thought it was pretty cool like this is actually a really nice welcome station just going regular stuff of like other stuff here
this didn't work unfortunately
I went online
download up the driver
it works completely
find them this is the extension cable for the USB it has the a female portion and the male portion so this is a charging cable and you can charge the tablet because this is Wireless has around like twenty-something hours of battery life if you turn it off it's kind of like save that battery so we can do this by turning it off
this is the extension cable so basically you can just like plug into Mexico as the cables too small or too short and then you want to like reach longer
you probably like attached to something like over here and then by doing so you make it into like a loop for the tablet pen holder loop something like that
just attach onto it
I don't exactly know
was because like sometimes
I play also and I my hands get really sweaty so it sometimes hinders my movement so I thought hey I should try this club up and they were like oh it's included in the tablet so I was like perfect so I tried it out
I'm I'm playing
oh so you want some kind of pivot you need some kind of fixing points and as in like if you have your if you're writing something just in general let's say with something like a pen
don't have your handle hovering and in writing which your arm hovering the whole thing you don't write like this you're right with your hand down and which you're at least with some kind of pivot as to like lift slow or at least like have your heavier wrist or your elbow be like a pivot or something like that or at least like a part of your arm and the glove of reduces the friction way too much the point where
I don't think it was very suitable although you know I didn't really spend too much time with it but I spent at least like good amount of time like two hours three always with it but I just couldn't get used to it
I really like then what I what they could have made better so for the tablet itself the rubber foot that I was going to mention is just a amazing
I'll be studying for the next two days including today because I have a test tomorrow actually the day after but um I'll do my best to answer as many questions that you may have
I do make a lot of gameplays of also ice cream sometimes actually very very frequently and I will continue to make better videos in the future but for now thank you very much for watching
take care bye bye
my name is
Ellie and I've been reviewing the new generation of the Kindle Fire seven kids edition for me for moms reviews with my four and a half year old son and my two and a half year old daughter
it's been used
is this stand
but once it's up it's fabulous um it really is good for when you're out about if you if your child just gets fed up holding it and it just stands up really steadily and I think that's part of the reason why it's quite good that it's a little bit stiff to pop open and but as you can see it's brilliant and it you you can use this you can see that you can bend it up and down and you can only use it two ways you can use it as I've got it there as you can see or you can pop it the other way around like this but you can't have it up on its side
that's a slight disadvantage
I think that the benefits of this stand really do outweigh any negatives that it might have and one of the best features about the this Kindle Fire self and kids edition tablet is the parental controls
then you just add the child child's profile by adding their name whether the boy or girl and their date of birth and then you can set the theme and so there's two different themes and one of the benefit under nine you under nine years old and another one for children who were aged 9 to 12 now
I'm gonna add the profile which I had already done but I've undone it to show you so it's added the profile on here so now my son and daughter will both have their own profile on the same tablet which they can switch which they can switch to and from quite easily and I've set two different pictures so they know who's who's is who so it's really quite easy to use
it's like just like draw box or have frustrations with and the first thing that I've already mentioned is that the case is slightly bigger on one side than the other so it's a bit harder for little hands to hold although it didn't really bother my kids too much and some of the other things
are that the battery
life could be better
my daughter in particular often left the device with a power intensive up running and just dumped it somewhere and then came back to find that the battery was really run down or occasionally she would go to pick up the tablet and say mommy
I want to play my tablet and it would have no battery at all left so we would then have to charge it and now she can imagine with like just over two and a half year old
it's it's hard to be patient sometimes and I think that all the kids would probably be better at taking care to close down apps once they've been playing in them and that would help with the battery life but little ones have really not going to understand that
the storage space
I think it's 512 you have to pay extra to get my crusty card and for more storage and that's gonna be quite price quite quite costly if you go if you want to go up to that bigger extra storage space
my kids were just delighted to have their own camera that they could take pictures of mostly half of my head or or me moving and looking more unfolded genic than I thought possible and but yeah they loved it and but I think all the children might think this camera is rubbish
they'll have seen their mom or dad's smartphone camera pictures and they'll think why is my device not taking that good pictures but really for kids on the younger side of the recommended age range

hello everyone in this video while we're doing electronic review that and I'll be reviewing a spy brand called dragon touch modern number for this tablet that we'll be reviewing is y8 8x plus is for kids
that's made exclusively by
USB charging port so they give you get the cable and this charge as well so you've got two options of charging this so they want to switch soon now in my opinion after testing
okay so this is
M display with IPS
I don't know why this is called a kids tablet but you know it's because of the casing and stuff like that it makes it more like you know stand out
so you can control it the way you want it with a story ebooks and pre-installed as well it also has like this is a silicone case by the way and he also has a built in
doesn't last that long
bear branded ones okay
so we fish
US dollars that's quite attractive of course I'll also show you my fantastic drawing with this product in this review but don't get jealous thanks a lot to Hugh a young for sending me this drawing tablet to review
first of all we get the graphics drawing tablet itself a replacement as well as I copy cover the USB charging cable for the digital pen and of course a mini USB cable for the tablet
then there's the digital pen the pen holder with four pen tips and one tip clip inside very kind of your yawn to include our 10 black pen tips as well as 10 white ones to keep the drawing surface clean
CD my first impression of the 1060 plus is very positive as it looks fresh and modern if that matters of course as always the electromagnetic digitizer technologies behind the tablet and we get a large active working area of ten by six point to five inches
LPI that are lines per inch the reading height on this tablet is point four inches of course the 1060 plus is also equipped with 12 Express keys and a total of sixteen function keys
Windows and Mac OS operating systems and even supports the old USB 1.1 interface for Mac's compatibility that of course means you can plug it in in USB 2.0 3.0 and 3.1 ports to the power consumption of just point 35 watts it's ultra low the dimensions of this 1060 plus Rd following 360 but 240 by 10 millimeters with just 770 grams
it's not even heavy
what came fairly surprising to me was the fact that this drawing tablet is very robust despite its size and low weight the surface is entirely out of plastic but doesn't feel cheap actually on the back are four rubber feet to keep the tablet and eiseley in place on the desk on the left is the mini
thus all your drawings from your pc when you're on the go very kind of you're young to include one the setup up this tablet didn't even take a minute
which is nice
I like that
the responsive pen and tablet is very good for just ninety dollars and it didn't experience any scratchy feeling or laggy situations the pressure sensitivity is not optimal but very acceptable
my hands simply are not meant to draw but the huion 1060 plus is from what I've seen at a price of just around $90 you can't go wrong with this one and we got tons of accessories
thanks for watching
and yes
I love about it
I have a Nancy
it's very fidgety
so yeah completely wireless
don't keep it
I think it helps
protect the tablet
while you're drawing sometimes your hand yeah so it prevents wear and tear also gives a bit more support so yeah also does not activate to uh your hand so that's cool just reactive activates do that okay
it's not my setup
you get it sticks
it's not magnetic so you know it's safe to find your computer and stuff hey Joe and here you can actually set up shortcuts and I you can have it like yeah
tell further ado
let's just start it
congratulations to nico

first thing i noticed about the tablet is that it's huge way bigger than any other tablet that i've used so far the packaging that it came in also looked clean and nice
free pen a 21.5

if you're new to the crew make sure you subscribe get notified for more videos just like this but today we're going to be taking a look at 38 tips and tricks for the lenovo m10
plus so your very first time make sure you stay locked in with me so we can go over these tips and tricks for lenovo m10 plus so the first tip that i want to talk about for this tablet is actually going to be how you can remove the google feed on this device so you may have noticed that you when you swipe to the left you may get this really narrow um box here and kind of looks weird compared to like on other phones because it doesn't fill up the whole thing maybe you don't use that a lot maybe you just want to get rid of that
now another thing you might want to do on this device is when you're getting notifications in on this device you may want to silence some of the notifications coming in
is that the home screen can get messy when all your apps get downloaded so what you want to do is create small folders so just if you have games you may want to group them together into smaller folders that way
i'm just putting into a folder and i see some social media apps so i'm going to group those ones into a folder and um you know here's another game so you could just do that with your device and then you can go ahead and type right here and it's gonna actually let you name it so you could just type games right here down below and then hit the check mark so now you have your games folder and then you could have um social media right here so you could just type social media right here as well so now
then you're gonna get the option where it says owner add guest or ad user or more options so you this is where you can actually add new profiles on your device so you can add you can restrict apps and certain content from this account and i think this is pretty cool because you can actually personalize the device for different users
another thing that you can do is go into the settings and that way we we want to get the battery percentage bar to show up on the right hand top corner of the device
so we're going to go into where it says battery on the device and it's going to be right down here below we're going to go ahead and click this and then you're going to see the percentage which is does say 40 right at the top on here now
click that as well
just go into display
this is going to give you the option to use your device without your app tray so all your apps will actually be on once on the home screen with no app tray so a lot of people may like that a little bit better that way
if you want to type in passwords without people seeing you do it and you're kind of sketched to see them if they may be looking over your shoulder you can actually hide that for a little bit of peace of mind
but you're gonna have to go into your privacy option then you're gonna have to go into advanced and then once you're in there you're gonna have to click this option where it says unchecks show um password so now it won't show the password as you're typing it
so what you're going to go ahead and do is go into display where it's going to give you more gestures and what you want to go ahead and do is while you're in this option you're going to get to the system navigation right here for gesture navigation so you can choose the regular gestures where it gets you
the side scrolls two buttons three button navigation or productivity mode um productivity mode is like a new one because it's not on most devices but when you have it on there it's going to display the icons in the back on the bottom kind of like a desktop and you can kind of scroll through those and you get the back recent and home button as well you can get to your most recent when you hit that the back one and i just think this is kind of cool because you can get access to the whole interface on there as well now another thing you can do is do a scrolling screenshot which i want to show you how to do that right now so all you have to do is go into like a app like um instagram or something
scroll shot right down there then as you can see right here it's scrolling while it's capturing the screenshot i definitely think that's pretty cool and then you could just click to stop so now you will have your screenshot on the device saved and um i think that's something that's pretty cool because um you could always save that for later and um you know save it and do anything you want with it but it's definitely going to be safe right here in your gallery another thing
that's cool on here
uh which is cool so if you scroll down to the bottom you just hit system and then hit system update and it's going to start checking for the update down below right here
so if you're in youtube and you want to go into like social media at the same time all you have to do is swipe up like that and then long
that's cool is
and let's say you
what's cool is that
but what's cool is you can actually hit this window right here in the new window and go ahead and hit um move to other window so now you could use two um um you know browsing windows at the same time from chrome so you can also you know use this one at the same time to get other specs and information at the top of this window as well so i think that's pretty cool that they let you do split screen browsing with the with the chrome windows another thing
it's going to open up the camera and um that's a quick way to get to the camera really quickly if you want to open that up and um you know it does give you decent quality with proper lighting in that something else that i found really helpful about this device is when you go into your settings of this device and you go into the storage of this device and you check um some of the options right here
let me see
and then it's going to load all the apps right here so let me just wait for that to load okay so once that loads you're going to hit see all and it's going to show you a list of all your apps so the ones that you would normally move to the sd card are games large game so you can hit that then go to storage where it's going to say storage and what it does is it
you want to click off um the option where it says shutter sound right here because that's going to be on by default and then you want to turn off countdown sound because you know you could just look at the device and you don't really need a sound when you're taking the picture another option it does give you is to select storage and it has an option here for sd card so you can move that to the sd card for any videos or pictures that you take
right here and click that because what you want to do is go to the top hand left corner and select this one that way we can get the auto change of wallpapers here so you want to turn that on and then what you want to do is uh set your wallpapers uh every day to your device and oh that looks beautiful
right here
set wallpapers home screen
you could select dynamic movie music or custom and it's going to give you the custom eq settings that you can check around mess around with but um this is pretty cool because you can see the equalizer here and it's going to give you the option to mess around with that as well
another thing that you need to note is that this device doesn't have the gallery app so just go to the play store and type here but this is the app right here game ozone gallery and this is um free of charge and it gives you all your galleries
it's going to allow you to shut the device on or off um let me show you and you can manage time restrictions blue filter light posture to make the kids sit straight with the device or bumpy alert
so that you know they won't be able to use it on like a train or something like that but you know you can pretty much tailor these options here
so all you have to do is to get that to go on is go into your display settings and what you want to just do is tap both of these options here and you even get auto rotate the screen as well but you know you do get those two options there another thing that may be useful to
you is adaptive brightness
that's pretty cool
so you want to turn that on because it will flash when you receive a notification and when the device is charging as well another thing that's pretty cool is we do have the option for screen record so if you're looking at something on the internet and maybe you see something that you might want to save for future reference
it's going to pull out the screen recorder with the record button and stop button and we do have a shortcut right here that can activate it as well but there it is
connect your device to wi-fi right here and then if the screen that smart tv that you're using is also connected to wi-fi it's gonna pull up on your device and whatever's showing up on your device will now be showing up on the display on your tv for your smart device now
you could turn that on just by going to your settings but with this enabled it's going to be like a little control center on the side where you can actually do screen recording screenshots
the you know the color of the screen from bright to normal color and i think that's pretty cool and you could even put it on dnd when you hit this one it'll turn off all the notifications as well but not only that they do offer this option here
just draw on the screen with a pen and um you know it's gonna draw right on the screen at any moment and then you can pretty much save that you know what i mean
take do the screenshot boom and then you could always clear it out but that screen right is always going to be there in that control panel as well now another thing that's important for your battery health is scheduling the system to um turn off your device every so often so what you want to do is go into your device right here where it says system and then you can actually schedule power off and put the time that you want it to be turning off
and that's the power up time can be like 4 am or something of that nature and then just hit that but that's going to be good for your battery life overall another thing that also does protect the battery
where if your phone is connected to the charger for too long the device will know to stop the um the battery from reaching maximum thresholds so you want to enable that because then it will help you with that
um when it comes to charging when you're actually using a camera on this device you want to make sure that you have the setting enabled in the in this in the um in the camera where it's going to put your settings right here
let me show you so you hit settings and you want to make sure it says maximum brightness so that when you're outdoors you can see the screen and see what you're taking a picture of on the screen as well and i usually have camera
i can just know when i've take where i've taken a photo and things of that nature and it's just a lot easier to remember you know where i took the photo another thing i turn on when i'm using my tablet is the screen off um option where it will time out after 30 seconds
maybe twitter
get a social media
and then whatever else you didn't want to get notifications from you would have that option so i think that's pretty cool but let me know what you guys think about these 38 tips
what's happening everyone
if you need more as always i run the antutu benchmark on it and you get a score of about a hundred thousand which is pretty normal for a budget
we see a picture of the device itself and turning the box around we can see all the specifications and what comes in the box with it so in the box
i am i was kind of hoping we'd have one at the bottom and one at the top but no they're both from at the bottom but they do sound a pretty decent for a tablet next to that
if you're just watching videos you can easily get an hour of screen on time on one charge but if you do play games you're gonna lower that to about five to six hours so it really depends what you do with
and luckily we don't have any heavy skins so this is kind of close to stock android and we don't get a bunch of useless apps that come pre-installed so you just get some google apps and that's about it so nothing really holding the tablet back just as i expected
so for these um usual apps you're not gonna have any issues with a tablet like this now if you do plan on playing um heavy games like graphic intensive games then the tablet isn't gonna do that great
but i'm assuming that if you're gonna try something even more graphic intensive is not gonna do that great so for light games um yes you can use it but if you do plan on playing a bunch of games on it maybe this is not gonna be the best tablet for that
we also have a gps unit inside so if you use google maps and you download some maps you could technically use this as a navigation screen in your car or something like that which is definitely a great addition
the performance is okay but if you're expecting like ipad performance you're not going to be able to get that from a tablet like this as i said it does great for social media stuff but it's not gonna do exceptionally good for um heavy games
all right guys um
thanks for watching
I've got this one
I've got another one
I want to point out that one of the things that is definitely missing is Bluetooth and I think if it had bluetooth would be a lot better but for the price
you're not going to get all of the features so this is the first can tablet that we've been using around the house for the past year or so and I'd say it's kind of our backup device when somebody's tab will might be charging or a phone is charging or something or broke or whatever
so things happen
there's game that
thanks for watching
And while i was novel to use a tablet that blended all the benefits of E-paper with the universal appeal of color, it was also quite limiting to be locked into a platform that only let me run a handful of preloaded apps and forced me to sideload most of my books, because it didn't support Amazon Kindle.
As Sasha Segan of PCMag puts it, Onyx makes E Ink tablets that bridged the gap between Kindles and iPads and it does so in this case, by blending the newest color E Ink screen on the market with Android.
(upbeat music)
I've been privileged to review some of the weirdest mobile tech in existence from the Lenovo Yoga Book 2-in-1 to the wearable front row camera, to the wrist wrap-around Nubia watch.
And if you wanna know how the underlying technology works I'll point you back to my pocketbook video. The key takeaway here is that while you get the same 4,096 colors, they're a bit brighter and more saturated on Kaleido Plus, although still duller than LCD or OLED screens on your more traditional tablets.
As with all E Ink screens, the more light you pour on it the better you can see it, which is why Kindles and kobos are still the best E-Books for the beach.
Air made me envy
like Nova or Niagara.
Remember Kaleido
Plus or not, this is still E-paper, so most launchers that rely on all the swiping and scrolling that modern day Android demands just won't be as easy to use.
I've used before.
Speaking of my review device from Onyx here hasn't been plugged in and about 10 days, it's been through three software updates in that time and it was still sitting at about 75% charge before I started filming this review.
So why not
This is called ghosting
Just keep in mind
To rotate the screen
Don't get me wrong
I think Android brings enough flexibility that I would personally still choose this one over the new Ink pad color from Pocketbook, even though that device has the same display for $329.
If you can settle for an LCD and iOS, the IPad mini starts at 399, or if Android is a must but a backlight is optional, wait for TCL's new NxtPaper powered tablet to hit the market at 349
(upbeat music)
If you wanna see some other takes on the Nova 3 Color I'll link to some others I've found across the web including good ones at Gizmodo and Mobile Tech review.
but let's face it
i guess is amazon
come in this
it's a quad-core 1.3
i even find myself
sometimes clicking an application one or two three more times because i don't know if my first click or first touch actually registered but in fact it's the tablet taking a really long time to open up that application but then again it's a 50 tablet
that is a plus
yes it's really bad
it's a 7 inch
it gets loud enough
it has a selfie camera and it has a camera out back but i'm not going to get too much into the cameras because let me just tell you one thing
don't use the cameras
they're just not very good and now let's get into the software experience because that's another area that i kind of struggle with it's technically running android but it has amazon's fire os on top of it so it's a really heavily skinned android tablet
you've probably used before
most of the popular
and it's every amazon service you can think of like think of an amazon service and it's pre-installed on this tablet for sure actually looking at the software fire os kind of throws so much content at you
the one thing i really like about the software is the ability to add other profiles and that means this tablet is perfect if you have kids because you can add another profile for your child just switch profiles over to them
and in their profile you can restrict certain applications certain content even certain movies or videos and they won't have access to any of that you can really limit what kind of content your children is looking at or playing with on this tablet
it's only fifty dollars
it's so cheap that you can even have just an extra tablet laying around if you want to just use it for reading or for watching movies next to your bed
it's so cheap
even if you want to just use it or have an extra tablet when you're commuting and you want you don't want to take an expensive device along with you
well once again
maybe not all of them but at least some of them all while keeping cash in your pocket and these days we can all do a little bit more of that right keep a little bit more cash in our pocket

my name is Sian
for each day display paired with dual speakers and excellent battery life making it the perfect device for binge watching an entire season of money chest and yes it also comes with 4G support so you can stream videos on the go using your mobile data but the icing on the cake would be

no no fast

it's only the 30
you don't have to worry about outer visibility but on the flip side even on the lowest sitting the screen is still too bright and constrain your eyes when using it up 9
how about the screen text pix 10.1 inch IPS panel 1920 x 1200 Full HD display 2.5 details panel AI of demise display design and build quality despite being an entry level tablet
the p10 eats the offers a sleek and modern design with a made-up back 2.5 detox panel and a slim build at Sur point 79 79 cm it looks and feels amazing
now yes some of you might point out the large chin and forehead not to mention the noticeable sideburns however a bit less display is not idea for a large screen tablets as your fingers will end up touching the display while holding it
luckily though tablets don't get as much abuse as our smartphone and you also have the option of purchasing the pitten pitten HD with appFolio case other notable aspects would be the twin bottom firing speakers a 3.5 cm or 3.5 mm headphone jack and a USB type-c charging port now the device does cut corners
sporting the unit shocked ec 9 8 6 3a of the whole chips is an affordable entry level to mid-range is OC system-on-chip the focus enhance performance with lower power consumption this is the plan period of 3 gigabytes of RAM and P I sped up technology for better memory management
well if you are planning to use the tablet for browsing the web watching Netflix and YouTube or maybe playing some casual Mobile's games then it more than fits the bill you can even play
P obg on the tablet con that you will need to lower the graphics settings and stumble into some framedrops here and there but the game is still playable now
this can quickly run out as you keep loading up the device with games apps and media files such you would like to take advantage of the an expandable storage which supports up to 128 gigabytes via micro
SD card commerce
and that's it
the picture
it is by no means a camera that you would take along for travel photography or the likes however it can help you take pictures of documents and a front camera is useful for con conference calls
MB and this time we will talk about battery life the p10 it's becomes with a massive 6000 mAh battery but the behemoth 10.1 screen also requires a lot of juice
this is again paired
now that's impressive
basically on a single charge you will be able to stream 2 to 3 movies back to back that being said charging the device is going to be a pain as it comes with a standard 10 watts charger
watts charger inside box
now we'll talk about the connectivity the Tecla spittin eats the offers 4G connectivity with support for FDDI LTE and TD LTE for uninterrupted call quality and internet access however it only has one SIM slot which is okay since dual
the class beaten
WWE be Spears calm
thank you very much
please subscribe you you
okay she's ready
hi guys today
okay fun huh
is that the bottom
show me action movies
alexa provides visual responses
the device automatically locked
so we were able to set parental controls so that she can't do downloads and things on her own some default so you spray your hands you spray your device spray spray spray
it's just like water
i think and then you put it on and it creates a surface so that you can feel free to move it around as you need it and then they give you a squeegee so you can just squeegee out all the bubbles and it takes some time for it to really dry underneath but once it
it's really a strong
you can see that it's got a cover but it really and if there's one drop of dust it'll leave a dot but i don't get too fussy if it's got a little bit do you like it
you can yeah oh
which if you see we simply slide the wikipad tablet into the controller and it sits nicely inside there for us to use and play with so those two come initially separate we then have our power block and cables with a European and UK
we also have our QuickStart guide to take us through all of the kind initial setup of the Wiggly pad where all of the buttons are located and what they do but essentially if you have an Android smartphone or have used an Android tablet in the past
this is just a tablet more designed towards that of mobile gaming and then lastly we get a nice cloth in here to make sure our screen is all kept clean and nice for when we want to use it so if we now take a closer look at the wikipad tablet you can see here
HDMI port there
on the back
we have the base for it to slot into and then we have a nice wikipad embedded design there it tells us it's got 16 gigabytes of memory which is great to know we also have a slot for a micro SD card as well
so if you did want to put more memory in there you can and then of course we have the charging dock at the bottom as I said that is running on an older version of Android jelly bean but it is fully upgradeable in the near future
it works perfectly
so if you were thinking in your head and you know that iPad Mini because you're not been an Android user in the past then it's that kind of size so you can open up
you can get any app that you would normally be able to get on an Android smartphone on here whether you want it to be Skype your emails any social media any of that stuff
there's no microtransaction shift
as soon as you hit level 10 you can decide to upgrade to premium if you want to and I absolutely love that I think that's a great game model but it's extremely fun
I'll add some gameplay in now so you can see that but some other options of games that are highly recommended are things like Real Racing 3 dead trigger dead zone hockey games FIFA 14 and Sonic
Store's you can use that simply as you normally would on a phone or a tablet you completely just take off the controller and then you're able to play the game as normal which i think is absolutely great so much like we've computers to see how well a system performs we use 3d mark but for tablets
if that is something that interests you it did get actually 2 stars out of 5 on performance on the 3d mark score but that is not the only thing that you will look at when testing a tablet
another thing that
I think on that side of things it performs really well however after gaming for periods of time on it if you are playing games back to back to back you will notice
it'll be as if it just kind of drops one frame then it picks itself back up again but that's to be expected it normally happens on my galaxy note 3 phone
you just hold the controller in your tablet is also cured nicely in there you can actually charge it whilst you're using the controller by inserting the charging cable into here rather than directly into the tablet
they're extremely responsive
everything is secure
it works extremely well
you may have to 12:3 quite a few games before you find when you specifically like or find one evil works really well with the controller because still there are some games that says it is compatible but some of them the controller still feels a little bit off and it would be much easier to use it with the touchscreen but games like fifa and real racing definitely benefit from having a controller things that need precision and something that you would normally play on a home console simply because of the design the cost and how well it performs and definitely gonna give this a gold rating
I still prefer a handheld console like a PSP PS Vita 3ds and I will always have that close to my heart because Nintendo game boys of what I grew up on and I've always kind of felt that the payment models of mobile games kind of always frustrate me but mi love hidden gems on the App Store's if you're willing to spend enough time looking for them much like Reba
this one had a usbc and this one was sold everywhere in the world again though it was pretty limited we were only allocated 100 units as were most of onyx's distributors
and when they were gone they're gone but if you just so happen to have one this is what it's gonna look like and obviously we're pitting it up against the successor
enjoy so you
i 10x windows
I 10x tablet offers a less expensive alternative to Microsoft Surface tablets while it does not have a building kickstand the magnetic case folds to prop up the screen nicely just note that you cannot adjust the angle the 10 inch display is suitable for using Windows even in desktop mode and it is IPS
and can be disabled when typing for long periods by pressing the function and alt keys the tablet features 2 gigs of RAM which is a little on the low end for Windows 10
along the side
USB port a mini HDMI port and a micro USB port which can work with the included OTG cable there is also a micro SD card slot underneath the flap
now the tablet comes with a special charging cable which is a little annoying to need to keep track of it appears that you can also use a regular micro USB cable to charge the tablet and I notice that draws more than one amp of power that means it may not charge as fast as using the dedicated charger but it can be used in a pinch
they're not full versions but they do include basic functionality allowing you to view documents and perform basic edits you also have access to the Windows Store allowing you to install plenty of third-party applications and games overall the dragon touch eye
thanks for watching
oh hi guys today
ten master t10 tablet
just come out
okay so repeated apart
I'm actually quite surprised
100% fully charged
I'm not familiar with it that Play Store is already installed we've got Gmail and Chrome or it installed don't know what that is photos not sure what these are I would have seen we can uninstall any apps that we don't need but it would appear to be only what about for their Chinese apps pre-installed
I've seen on
now there's a brand new model of so obviously there are gonna be bugs appear but it's nice to see that there is actually a very simple to use update facility so it should should keep abreast of any problems that arise
let's just see off but my fingerprint and it's asking for a pen whoops okay so obviously there's not gonna be any visual difference that presumably that has done what it said on the update and actually improve things
they're tech lost
its first class below
when you're actually holding the tablet then the sensor comes very nicely suited to where your finger would go and how it's actually just powered it on to just touching it there turn it back off again
I think they've put that fingerprint in the ideal place of much better typing and actually having it on the front the bezel around the very edge would have had to have been much bigger and it would have been quite clumsy to to actually operate it so yet another great tick for tech laughs
we're all done
SIM card PIN now
it's a later date and future models that will probably incorporate a SIM card but I suspect that's a little way down the line yet with probably six months or more away so there we are so that is not for a SIM card
it's a pump
this water mattered
I'm really pleased to to have that included that's quite exceptional okay so I've had a couple of days to actually familiarize myself with a tablet and have a play with it and I must say it just performs perfectly
it's perfect
absolutely they may
and of course then
put the charger in
and the quick charger will will charge it to 75% in under an hour which is another nice feature looking at the cons well the G it's got GPS but there's no compass
well it's it's perfect
I can't think of a better tablet for for the price in certainly in this price range and I keep going on about the screen but the the screen really is superb matched with the fact that it's fast is it is wonderful
hey there everyone
those of you
I have been
I've had this channel since 2010 and have been doing digital art since in all that time I've only ever used one tablet and that is a Wacom Bamboo fun and it has served me very well over the years the tablet
everything was super secure
we're gonna rattle that baby around which is good because the Amazon box that my tablet came in was a little worse for wear but the tablet itself and its box and packaging beautiful alright with that out of the way
starting with the pros
is that taking
that small little wireless adapter anywhere makes me really nervous having a special little place for it just eases my mind a little bit and makes it more likely that
maybe do it my second issue might be related to the first one but I have yet to determine that for sure the tablet preferences I cannot open them without manually telling the program to run as administrator
you have to go through an extra step just to check or change something real quick another minor inconvenience is that the pen itself does also require charging now with the
so it's not really that big of a deal a little bit of a pet peeve though is that when charging the pen it will not sit in its little stand because the cord makes it too
Wacom tablets
I didn't use the eraser on my old tablet pen but like I said if it's something you're used to it might be a little off-putting not to have that option available to you
what can I say
I don't know if maybe I was hitting some shortcut keys or what but I was really confused and off-put by it so aside from some minor inconveniences that honestly you're going to run into when getting used to any new tablet
hey cafe crew
how far is coming
this is back from the days when man lived in caves and use these kind of ports so as you can see things have come a long way from there so let's move to the brand new one
I've actually just taken out of the box and I've already unbox that you'll notice here that I also have a Intuos Pro paper edition large and my next video mentioned going to unbox that and show you everything but to save you having to watch me
so let's start with
it's really quite slick
the other pens do work on here the previous edition and we've got a new base and tile a new base and we're going to break that down in a sec and then also what we've got
go into your welcome settings here and you'll see that this is fit you could also go under your preferences but the very top button here will take you into your welcome desk top center and you'll see here into as pro not updates available and I actually ran
firmware updates on there that when you since then so the first thing you want to do is download the latest driver and then update the firmware and everything works and now it works and as you can see
it's touched so let's talk about what's on the tablet so on the end here you're going to notice there's a couple of things there's a couple of little switches on here
being you know pushing buttons on here to do it notice that the touches on and if we pull that across now the touch is off it then the other one of course is the on/off this nice little middle
is you just tap this button here and then that will actually start up the Bluetooth and then you can connect it to your computer or your device so if we look at our tablet we notice we have on the left-hand side we have our Express keys as eight of them just kind of similar to what we've had in the past then we have of course the touch ring here where we can tap here to see the different things that it's going to do so we can go through the different things
so all these Express keys and touch ring and everything are all programmable just like they have been in the past but the big thing really is look at this new surface
it's not it's kind of a quite weighty and if you look at it what you can actually do is you just press it down with the with your palm of your hand and then you can just kind of turn it and then when you open it notice all our lives are in here so in the past they kind of stood up and you didn't really know what was on them but now you can see the NIP see you can see we've got a next a different nebs and we can grab those and we can quickly put them in now to take this out instead of having to bite it out with your teeth
it comes right out much easier than before and of course you can change those other nibs got a little instruction card here shows you how to set it up but they look at some interesting things one of them here
is this little card and this has the different type so if you look on it goes rough sanded and smooth so we've got a rough standard and so if it actually says that on there so you can actually put that down and you can feel what it would feel like to try these different types of surfaces so if you want to add any of these surfaces to your tablet you can actually try them out a little bit here and then order them and then you can place them on the top
I want to put
I believe if I'm wrong I'll change it in the annotation so it just has this incredible Felix but while I'm painting I really can tell the difference with all these different levels look at the smooth gradients that I'm able to create here just by gently painting over here to just add a little bit of shading and then if I hit the X key and then I start painting with white I can shade and just kind of build that up a little bit and it just feels nice like I can just gently go on here have to rush they can take my time and it just just feels good it just feels better all right so let's go and have a look at some of the settings in here with this tablet and you can see here we can set up the pen we can have it do different things you can notice
we just go to functions go to on-screen controls and there's our brush tools and this is what we've got set right here so you know we can change these to do different things you know you can put all kinds of keyboard shortcuts and stuff like that in there but essentially what would happen is when we're working and we hit that back button and we're right here in
that's actually kind of useful and you can see how the blend mode is changing there just by tapping on there and then when we're done we just grab our brush and we continue to work now
and that'll take us into our settings and we can change our settings if now notice one of the things in here it shows the battery level and that battery liver will also be up here so we can tap up there and we can see
so we've got a fully charged battery so you can also put that in our test pilot and close that down so we can put that in there and we can also go to our preferences from up there
you can do to do different things you can see that and you can even set up your own gestures so you know if you want to tap with three fingers you can bring up the radio menu or see
Express keys so
let's choose the application
Express keys work differently just for the programs such as Photoshop or Lightroom working with one of the things I love to do is setup different shortcuts for mail and for word and different things like that
so let's just choose a keystroke and then I'm going to do command shift option P and what that does is it's going to create a composite layer on top or a stamp visible
so we can come of this from posit and click okay if I select these layers and then I just tap on that one button boom notice what it does is it creates all those layers together and a flattened layer on top without flattening your layers underneath the composite layer stamp visible
I like it
I'm getting good results is giving me the sensitivity that I like when I'm working an image here that I just dodged and burned and stuff a little bit previously
it's essential so really
it feels really nice
I like the fact
I'm probably going to disable the touchpad on here so I can actually type without messing it up and then I'll use this for navigating intercession to solve one of the problems there so I'm really digging this right now so the next video I'm going to do is we're going to take this bad boy right here the Wacom Intuos Pro paper Edition and we're going to crack this up and see what's in the box and check it out so hey guys thanks for watching
Wacom tablet right now
I was not sent this tablet by XP pen unlike wafeek so everything you hear today will be from the points of our consumer as well as a reviewer so I just went to make that one clear that I did spend my money on this
XP pen tablet the baroque unexpectedly while I was using it the other day the hardware essentially just failed after its it had entered its fourth year of constant use so the tablet eventually just broke down and it wasn't able to be fixed so at this one in to replace it it replaces the artist 10s on XP pens lineup as well
I could get
I do have the artist 10 somewhere so I will be bringing that one out for other elements is to compare the size and the design but I wanted you all to know that this is not a review that has been endorsed by the company unlike meek
this was entirely me
I just want to make that very plain that everything you're hearing here if I'm a little bit more nitpicky is because I have spent my money on this last time
any negatively affects people
so that's all
I really wanted to let you guys know before we started the video and I will see you at the unboxing so it's finally come time to unbox the tablet and I was really really excited to get my hands on this from the images it looked like a wonderful and sleek piece ok and as soon as I opened the box I could see
the redesigned the tablets
NS and it honestly
is your blue cleaning
in case your tablet break through in the first one or two years of use and that's your setup and display guide and here's the smudge guard in action underneath this
I believe it's 2008
it's what
it stores your spare nibs in the top as you can see by the label and on the bottom it literally causes the pen inside of it and the bottom comes off to become a pen holder as you can see
I'm more traveling
here you can see me taking of the packaging and it does say to remove that first layer and underneath it has an anti-glare coating which unfortunately reflects a very professional setup that I have going on peeling away the shiny protective plastic of those and that surface that the fruit diffuses the light on the screen
this means that nothing's going to end up reflecting off and interfering with the drawings and you can see me displaying all the items that come within your box setting off the wires for the tablet
it's actually surprisingly easy
although it does seem a little bit complicated to a one that hasn't actually use the screens have but before in the set of the wise you're given you have one it's called a USBC lead which plugs directly into your tablet after this you have a black USB in a HDMI cable these will both connect straight into your laptop
there's also a red
you're also provided words
I do recommend setting the cursor to absolute mode because that means that you can use it across both screens as well as calibrating your display the colors on this are really rich so they will vary from your laptop but overall this is just a positive because it means you now have a full collection of color so you can see me testing out the table and I have to say immediately
it's very thin
I don't have that much footage of this drawing because I did run into a problem with the drivers now this is not the fault of XP pen this is actually on the side of OBS
would for some reason move it to the transform tool or to the note of the transform so I was right I it was it was near itten and it slowed me down to my favorite house to reverse it and by that point
it's lethal may along with a gorgeous professional-looking redesign there's an eraser on the back of the stylus now looking at this tablet on Amazon I thought this could be good and I was wrong
it's absolutely great
this was brilliant
I really really enjoyed our testing out the tablet and it might be my favorite feature of this new design and as someone who owned the artist tennis and this is now the replacement I can say that XP pen have done a fantastic job in replacing their new beginner entry level tablet
this is a fantastic piece of care and I definitely recommend it to anyone who is in the position to buy up speaking of buying it in the cost which I mentioned at the start of the video
Powers in the UK and I believe it's $250 in the US now I did get this tablet cheaper because I found a discount code in one of the replies I
it's no longer valid
12 that's all
this one's an AT&T as you can see from the little logo on the back and it's just a small incremental charge on your bill of a few dollars and then this is always online even if there's no Wi-Fi or Internet at all as long as the cellular signal your tablets online now
and all of this stuff all of those streaming services will work just fine on this device and it actually shows video at 1920 by 1080 s that is actually HD so that means you have a beautiful little device to have maybe at work to watch that great football game while you're busy ostensibly doing other stuff
I actually do that
story has a five thousand milliamp hour battery which means that it has tons of battery time and in particular that's twelve hours of constant video streaming so unless you're super super hardcore
it actually supports microSD
so you can pop
lets us parents set up what they can access where and when they can access it it gives us a lot of control over what's going on as opposed to saying here's Android good luck finding all that inappropriate content and then trying to cover your tracks honestly
I think many kids are actually going down that road right now but that's really a completely different topic for a completely different video and speaking of video you see that button right there that red button once you go ahead and click on it
what that'll do is you'll subscribe to my youtube channel and then as I produce more reviews and I do tons of reviews then you'll get all of them and I will certainly appreciate you as a subscriber so go ahead and click the button and feel good about the fact that you subscribed we good cool now back to this
this is running android
it's kind of for selfies and for video conferencing and that's only a 2 megapixel camera but still not too bad not a big fan of using tablets to take photos
it seems to me really unkind to be doing this sort of thing but I also when I go to sporting events or concerts and other things like that I do see people using tablets
so that's worth knowing
Bluetooth 4.1 so
that's crazy and expensive
3G one I have actually is through AT&T so you can pick it up through them and it will also then also have pre-loaded things like AT&T messages which gives you the ability to interact with your text messages from your tablet super cool so Samsung tab Galaxy Tab E check it out this is Dave Taylor and I'll catch you in my next video
Windows 10 tablet so if I quickly go through the specs it's an Intel Atom quad core processor 1gb ram 32 gigabyte SSD built in screen sizes 7 inch screen resolution is 1280 by 800 it has Wi-Fi b/g/n and probably - version 4
which is a micro
SD ok I want to turn this on and I'm going to time it because this has got an SSD in it a 32gb SSD it says that it can spoof up
I'm just going to test that right now about to test the speed to see how fast this turns on with the built-in SSD let's see how fast this really is
and it's very nippy
I'm not really complaining
at least battery
I've tested this out
YouTube Skype and you know you can even get some work done on office on this so it handles very well just going to put a YouTube trailer full HD videos play 720p and 1080p with no problem whatsoever
thanks for watching
touch max 10 tablet
let's get into it
this is actually
i thought why not
uh looking down though
it isn't my ipad
um it's 32 gigs of internal memory while 32 plus 3 and then it does have an st card slot that you can slide in there and add in more memory
uh i i did run a benchmark on this um and then i ran i said well i gotta have something to compare to so i ran it on iphone 10 iphone 10s iphone 11 pro ipad uh five fifth gen and then my ipad pro and even my imac
um but i'm going to get in and show you the tablet first before we get into the benchmark so when you when you actually get it does come with this big screen thing stuck on the screen that basically tells you remove this check
how you slide
port um up by that usb charge port is where the little door in the back here you actually if i can bring it towards you so you can see kind of grab it from the top and it comes off literally as a piece
uh there is the rear facing camera as well with flash on the side over here um there are the buttons and you can actually see we have the power the volume up volume down
and then there's a reset kind of pinhole there otherwise you have your speakers on the bottom with your microphone down there and it's pretty well you know it's a tablet
um it's so it's going to be um you know a newer refresh of android but it's you know it's i'm i'm sure that you could probably get this uh updated
obviously it's more
it is a pretty blank slate experience when you get it and you just go to the play store and start downloading apps so pretty simple experience in that regard so here is the results that i did with the geekbench
i'm actually highlighting the single core results so the best single core in the top worst on the bottom the tablet express max is going to be on the bottom for all both these results
i think 329 when it first came out if you could find one of those for a decent you know amount and of course we're talking android versus i ios
the 11 pro just blew everything out of the water that i have multi-core score um ipad pro um hit top notch then my mac then the 11 my iphone 11 pro but the tablet still still here right on the bottom 143 644 so with its capabilities
pretty low but then again it is just around you know 140 bucks so it shouldn't even compare to the fifth jet ipad even though that fifth gen ipad's a couple of years old now so but it is something to highlight and this doesn't lie
those are results that i can't even fudge so that is what they are so a little bit of depth into those numbers those those are numbers and so not everybody knows what those numbers mean
uh samsung galaxy note
good for simple tasks
it does do gaming
i just never do
i would probably estimate eight to nine hours in real in real world use and if you're graphics intensive a little bit less than that but about 10 you know 10 hours of viewing light duty stuff um would probably work fine
you know if if you have some kids that you're looking to don't want to spend a whole lot of money this the nice thing about this and i would take this over a fire tablet and that's because it's not locked into the stupid ecosystem that the amazon fire tablets are now
it's what it is
yeah it's pretty awesome
so that said guys um if you have any questions or comments on the dragon touch or if you want if you want me to do something else to to showcase more numbers or anything like that please comment below
let me know
share like subscribe
if you have any questions on this hit me up otherwise head over to techgooch.com and you can get a hold of me direct there uh but thanks for dragging touch to let me try this out
uh on browsing things like that but it's it's pretty simple um and there's not a whole lot that i can really show you on top of what i already have
i think
the responsiveness is decent
it really isn't
um so this is actually really handy specifically when i used to use my fire table for was just watching movies when i was uh donating blood or plasma or something like that um i just stand watch and it was
it was fantastic and i didn't worry about uh you know doing anything because it was a cheap tablet and this is something that you can give to your kids and not really have too much to worry about so if you have any questions again let me know otherwise
we'll see you soon
didn't it
sure did rick
so you can run this thing on the forklift and then if you want to get down off the forklift take it with you to go scan some stuff you can do that and you can also scan you know some of the barcodes up to 35 feet away and that's kind of unique for a tablet
like the tablet
but i've had a lot of customers ask me for integrated scanners and long range because they can not only use this device as a a handheld but you can also mount on a fork truck so this can replace the traditional vehicle mounted computer less expensively and can use be used in a pick and run operation so if you want to scan something on the floor you can just take it off and that dock does have a key lock so you don't have to worry about it being stolen so yeah
i see a lot of great opportunity for this device and it also has the option of a indoor or an outdoor screen so if you forklifts running outdoors or you're getting off your delivery truck outdoor and you want a little better readability uh bright sunlight as a screen
oh yeah oh and there's also a desk dock so this device could be not only used out in the field but could be used as a computer for the end user's desk so you have a vehicle dock as well as a desk dock so they do their work in their office they just pull it off stick it on the vehicle mount unit and away
they go well
i appreciate it rick
you're welcome you
another tablet review
this is a wireless tablet so it has an inbuilt battery which you need to charge with a charging cable that's provided the pen is not powered by battery so it doesn't require any charging there's the pot 8000 over levels of pressure sensitivity
we have the tablet
this is the pen
YouTube Facebook or YouTube page so these are the URLs thus a series of tablets from XP pen are their budget series of tablets so this is more affordable compared to the pen displays which they also make which I have also revealed so for the price which is under you as $100
if you not quite strong these are the indicator lights so when the pan is over the working area this will light up and when it's in Wireless mode this will light up when the battery is low
this will light up
it has audible clicks
this is very small
is the pen understand
we call this ten
so that's great
that are inside
you can choose
Express keys here to assign your own keyboard shortcuts to the physical buttons you can click here and click reset customer defined and choose this tab here hotkey and after we choose that you can just type in any keyboard shortcut you won and press ok
I have reassign it
let's has the strokes
I'm using right now
so the strokes
they appear perfectly fine
after you install the driver you still have to install the Wacom Intuos driver to get the pressure working so I'm going to pick a brush and to get the pressure working here to click here
you can use the scroll wheel here to change the brush size as well and it's very fast if I assign the buttons to change the brush sizes I have to click one time to change it one point but using a scroll wheel this is definitely much faster and more intuitive
this is coyote sketches
Pro pressure looks here
they work pretty well
you need to install a Wacom Intuos driver in addition to the XP pen driver in order to get the pressure working with Photoshop when I open Photoshop and draw straight away sometimes I get dots so the workaround to that is to choose a brush before you start
I think it works quite well unfortunately I am NOT able to test this tablet on Windows so you might want to check out more reviews on this on Amazon
thanks for watching
are you crazy no
I'm not okay
today's a very special day as I've said earlier because I got a package a really big package that I cannot wait to open even though I already know what's inside of it so my good friends at this company called awesome soul have reached out to me and they're like hey we're gonna send you a tablet can you review it and I'm like for free let's talk
I'm not sure how new you are to my channel but yes I do draw I make my thumbnails for all my videos and I used to be like a little bit of an artist like I wanted to major in that the tablet that I'm currently using is a Wacom Intuos Pro and it has served me well but you know what it's time for
ooh oh now
yeah let's do
this opening boxes is really hard to do in pursuit by the way so they call it art tousle because it's supposed to mimic the English phrase arts is soul
that's genius okay
I'm just completely missing
we got beginners
oh hell yeah
that's not candy
okay well actually maybe
okay now that it's successfully unboxed let's go and set it up and see if I can draw something for you guys because you guys definitely see how this works right
let's go let's go
so here's the box
and there's the little holder thing and it comes with the bag and you can put your little pen and your uh your glove and set this back for those who are into
I'm guessing you can program these buttons to do things for you like undo a lot of us like using undo in fact that's the only thing a lot of us ever also look there's a little scroll wheel thing you can use this
it's not muffled
what about the caribou
I did end up using my trackpad on my Mack to be able to scroll around the screen while I was drawing so I didn't actually use the pen to pan the canvas
I didn't really touch the scroll wheel all that much because what I want to zoom in I could just pinch and zoom that way with the trackpad as far as comfort there are lots of different ways that you can angle your tablet so like when you want to draw say just straight on the table and not have it tilted at all
I think they say like 50 degrees you can do that so I try to in all of bunch of different positions and I could really find a position that was that was good for me but I managed to like zoom through this drawing in a day which is really nice because usually drawings take me longer than a day especially now because I'm a little bit rusty so right now I should be sketching
it's super important to be able to see all the small lines that you draw when you're just barely touching that screen and one big thing that I noticed was when I was lightly touching on the screen
it wasn't even registering
it's a completely register
but if you go into the tablet settings you can adjust the lightness or the hardness of like how hard you press on the pen but I still couldn't fix the problem
they will register
I'm also coming from a standpoint of an artist who's been drawing for years on a Wacom tablet and coming from a different tablet company that has been highly successful so I'm I'm very picky
so there's like two buttons on the pen right there's a button on the closest to the nib and there's a button a little bit above it usually like for my previous tablet
I started doing that
I think it just comes down to personal preference if you like holding down the little button while you're erasing then you'll probably have to do some adjusting when you get this tablet because it doesn't really have that option one of the big things that a lot of people are probably gonna have questions about with this tablet is
I kind of like that because humble with my previous tablet it had touch capability and sometimes when I would forget to turn off it would accidentally start drawing on the screen with just my finger and I hated that
if you were to look at the display and then put the pan on the display the little circle it would show a little bit to the left of where your pen is but I was having some difficulties with lining up some of my lines with my other lines
I can't compare this to like the Cintiq or something but I think this might just be like a general thing for tablet displays or your pen will register and not completely below where your pen is
Oh during this phase I also put on the glove and that Club is actually really nice because I noticed that I want to have like really smooth lines with line art right if I don't want to use any of those plugins okay
it moved really smoothly and it was really nice of them to include the glue but yeah as far as the pen goes the only button that I touched was the eraser toggle
and it's not like a tablet where you have to look up at your iMac however it did make it a little bit difficult when I was trying to find you know like the right color and and just in general where to register my pen because it's not as bright as my IMAX screen
display okay now
that's when you start like filling in you know where the light is gonna hit and you know how big the muscles are gonna be and the fur patterns and everything
that's where everything starts to count with your drawing or your painting so this is where it's really important to have a great tablet that can really know hard you're pressing
I think you'll see in this drawing how much I was struggling to try to get the light blue and the light pink to like work with each other he didn't have like a reference sheet for his persona so I had to kind of make it my own and I could not get the pink to work so just like you know what I'm just gonna make that his pupils and call it a day
I'll just make him blue okay so I think in many instances you'll see here where I'm I'm trying to see if you know if this Pink's gonna work now I don't like it anyways back to the shading so when when I'm shading
I put like a dark coat over over all flat colors and then I actually go to the eraser tool and I start erasing areas where I think the light will hit more so I would start on the face and you can kind of see that on the top of the face where the snout is that's where I start erasing more because that's where the light hits and then it also was a great way that I can come to find his muscles and yeah I think that turned out really well but as far as the shading goes
this tablet definitely made the drawing experience a lot more fun a lot easier and a lot faster being able to see what you're drawing on a display makes things a lot easier than drawing onto a tablet and looking at a screen like
and that's what
obviously there's a difference because the Cintiq is what 1415 hundred dollars and that's the 16 inch so it's these two are basically the same size almost but there's a thousand dollar difference so I would definitely say that the artists old does have an advantage over the Wacom tablets it might not have like as high of resolution and it might not be as bright but it will definitely save you a thousand dollars
it is overall
my drawing
you'll be pro
I'm kidding so yeah
so thank you artists
drop ooh okay
you can say goodbye
thank you so much for joining and if you're interested in trying your paw at drawing - you should definitely pick up one of these displays thank you so much for article for sponsoring me and I'm really looking forward to using this display for editing all of my thumbnails and doing future art commissions

why is this cheap
Android tablet so popular
stars overall
check the affiliate links in the description below if you want to have a look at this tablet on Amazon for yourself and check out the reviews but I think it's time to dive right in
hey guys hope you're still staying home and staying safe it's mark here and I'm back reviewing some more affordable tech in my quest to sort the god-tier from the garbage and hopefully save you some hard earned money in the process today
I'm going to be looking at the seemingly very popular van keo matrix pad s30 a solid option if you're in the market for a budget tablet so let's dive right into the unboxing where
for this it has a nice and sharp 10.1 inch screen octa-core 1.6 gigahertz processor 3 gigabytes of RAM 32 gigabytes of storage with expandable storage up to 128 gigabytes dual speakers
10 hours of battery life a 13 megapixel rear camera and an 8 megapixel front facing camera a headphone jack and bluetooth 5.0 not at all bad considering the price but believe or not still a little bit underpowered compared to the identically priced Kindle Fire 10 that I mentioned earlier the build quality here though is great surprisingly lightweight and sleek
the bezels are instantly
I was a little bit disappointed that the screen protector left loads of sticky stuff on the screen when I peeled it off but in case you're wondering it did all come off just fine in the end
it's pretty sharp
isn't really something that
there is a black and white reading mode which you can activate in the display settings to give you a bit more of a Kindle like reading experience but it doesn't really overly help to resolve the glare issue in brightness
that's probably one of the few areas that the s30 actually clearly outdoes the Kindle Fire HD 10 so needless to say definitely could always be worse the speakers are decent enough certainly nothing groundbreaking but definitely an improvement over previous models which were a little on the quiet side in terms of battery life
I managed around 5 hours whilst gaming at 100% brightness which is pretty average in the grand scheme of things but I did manage much closer to 9 hours when browsing the web and reading ebook the battery takes around four hours to fully charge but slow
although at their lowest graphic settings needless to say other less intensive games ran well and the overall quality of the screen makes this a pretty good option for like gaming sessions
I couldn't even edit a photo in Lightroom as the sliders themselves lag when you move them and it takes quite a while for the s30 to render the changes
specs that rules out more creative tasks slightly below average screen brightness and the fact that there is other options out there like the Kindle Fire 10 which are more powerful and the exact same price so is the fire 10 HD an instant no-brainer then
HD you've then got all the Amazon bloatware which spoiler alert you cannot uninstall and how could I forget the inclusion of Amazon ads on your lockscreen that you have to pay 15 dollars or 10 pounds to get rid of which is incredibly cheeky in my opinion especially as its not very clearly stated when you're buying it even then when you're rid of Amazon special offers you're still stuck in Amazon fires OS ecosystem which is hell-bent on selling you Amazon products and services at all times that also means your restrictors to Amazon's App Store where lots of apps you'd get elsewhere are missing and you're limited to using Amazon stupid silk web browser
Google Play Store but it's not without its risks in the long term and I can guarantee that 70% of people are gonna find it too complicated so in that sense if the Kindle Fire 10 HD is the competition I can totally see why the S 30 is so highly rated on Amazon
they are pretty cheap
pretty highly rated
I have the small version of the Intuos pen and touch tablet but there are also a few other versions of this tablet including one that uses only a pen and there is actually a larger version of this tablet as well it's the medium size and it has a larger active area the Intuos pen and touch is made of mostly plastic but it feels relatively sturdy and I don't think build quality will be an issue under normal use
which can be set to many different functions and I'll get to those functions in a moment you also have two LEDs the LED on the Left indicates whether the tablet is on or off and then on the right you have an LED that indicates whether the tablet is being used either by the pen or using your finger down below that you have the active area of the tablet which is designated by four dots that are placed on each corner the active area of my tablet which is the small version is six inches by 3.7 inches
Wacom logo on it and I use this bar just to rest my hand while I'm using the tablet if you open the two larger doors on the underside of the Intuos pen and touch
you have the ability to add a wireless kit for about $40 extra which allows you to use this tablet without the USB cable this tablet comes with both a black and a blue pen holder and you can open up the door in the middle to change the color
you have a ring
one of my biggest complaints with this tablet is that the USB cable is not very long so if you're looking to use this tablet far away from your computer you may want to purchase the Wireless kit now
lets you designate different actions to each of the four keys at the top of the tablet for example you could have the key show the desktop or open an application or switch applications
I have it do is open Adobe Photoshop when I press the top left key because that is one of the applications that I use most often while I'm using this tablet moving over to the pen menu
you have the ability to set different actions when you click on the buttons of the pen as well as use the eraser and then you can also set the feel of the tip and eraser of the pen based on how firm or soft you want the pen to be when you're using it and you can just use the little sliders to change that
Wacom tablet I wasn't sure what to expect from the pen that was included but I'm actually very impressed with the feeling of the pen and I think it was designed very well for use with this tablet as I said before this
I wasn't expecting to use this tablet as a trackpad but after using it for a little while I found that it's actually a very nice to my Logitech performance MX Mouse
editing is to apply different brushes to one of my photos in lightroom in my opinion using this tablet is a much better alternative to using something like a standard trackpad or a mouse when
I'm photo editing
US dollars at the time of this recording and I think that's a great deal if you're looking to get a pen tablet but you don't need anything too fancy and you don't want to spend a few hundred dollars on one so that is my review of the Wacom Intuos pen and touch tablet
it's perfect for them
you have lots of google apps and this shows also some other things that you have already pre-loaded there's youtube and gmail so it's really ready to go basically all you have to do when you get
hey what's up
Van kill this
a quad-core processor
now it's thin
maybe some online shopping
I like a tablet that I can carry in one hand a decent sized screen lightweight you know and of course a lot of the bells and whistles such as memory and storage now after reading specs on this particular tablet
now the first thing
it'll tell you the manufacturer the model which is the s 8 the brand thank you and it will also list some other things like install ram total memory available memory internal storage external storage
you know so
we go okay so now the battery life like I said but use it for about three days is that 69% right now and the health is good on that and here we have the Android version which is nine PI
devices tells you about the rear-facing camera and the front-facing camera of course the rear-facing camera like I say it's five mix of megapixels and the front-facing camera is two megapixels thermal sensors apps and just a few other things so if you don't have that app you can hit them to the Google Play Store and you can download that but this tablet it's very responsive
I've been using it
I have no complaints
I think the only thing I really have a complaint on is the SD card getting it in and out see if I can even open it now because I have zero nails and I don't have anything around me
I actually have to use like a like a toothpick just the stick the SD card just to push it so it will release and come out in the same thing
I cover it out
that's pretty good because it allows you to keep track of your screen time and also you can set up some type of security measures for your children so that is really nice now
I'm say if you like using the keyboard well what you can do is you can just pair up your Bluetooth keyboard with this tablet and you're good to go now as far as audio quality well I can tell you right now is not that great but keep in mind
today's video
i wanted to put this part in the middle of the video but i think it's better for me to show the tablet first and show you guys the finished product at the end so yeah i am not getting paid for this
don't you think so
it looks so clean
it's just things that i didn't expect like the mouse pad and this pad thing to stick to your tablet for it to have that kind of pattern somehow it also has this pen case with the battery-free pen of course and the wire to connect your tablet like connect your tablet to your computer
and some of this small adapters to connect to your phone or android sadly it only works for android because i thought i thought it would work on my ipad but sadly it didn't though i did test the adapter with connecting a mouse and it did work plus i also did it on my phone and drew a smiley face it
it worked perfectly
i can lower the volume in just one touch in one of these buttons which is really great for when i'm listening while i'm drawing like i could just vibe and listen to music while i'm drawing and just in case i have to lower the volume
i wasn't that used to the touchscreen much since uh it was really hard to manage but i like the fact that the home key lights up though the design i like the blue and pink tone with the dots but the design on the media case would be an inconvenient if you are left-handed though i kind of think this whole tablet was only meant for right-handed people so that's just how i see it though plus the pen
the light part
so imagine this
this is real easy
you just go to the website provided in the box like they told you to and pick which driver you'd need for this tablet we would need the one called m1220 obviously and when the galman driver is all downloaded
yeah yeah yeah
so stay till the end of the video to see the finished product of what i made with it so yes let's go so yes i am a sans fan girl though i know he's not real and he's not mine
that sans is mine
when i'm bored and my dad used to own a computer cafe and when school's over i would finish my homework at school and go straight to that cafe and waste my time watching funny vines all day until we go home
i watched more videos and i was also introduced to other things such as glitch tale and other animations those comics that i found was uh well they portrayed sans as a flirty punny and caring character and young me just went
that's pretty hot
i mean cute
that's all gray
i'm not alone
oh my gosh
smart skeleton with that bony smell and jokes that yet the fandom somehow makes him sweet and flirty and i don't even know what to say about it so i was introduced to undertale undertale
t-a-i-l mind you
even though young me was cringing i still went on and went on with uh with google and about stuff and discovered fan fictions and more stuff that young kids shouldn't have seen
then i discovered anya the peasant or like undertale peasant from back then and the fact that hero c got drawn by the artist that made the comment that she dubs inspired me and then me and my friend started watching undertale cringe so i made fano
because it's a dare
and that's enough
they're really cool
please love you guys
it was really hard for me to drop while looking at the screen again because i got used to drawing on my ipad but i managed to survive with the headaches
so yeah okay bye
hello my name is
I've had this thing for probably about five or six years and it's worked perfectly fine for everything I needed to do since that tablet started to fail basically there was a short in the USB cord and it was starting to get annoying especially if I was using the tablet on my lap and the cord moved just slightly
I looked at the into rows for and I was almost ready to pull the trigger on it where and I decided just to wait a couple more days and I'm glad I did because they came out with the Wacom and two O's 5 now
here you've got three on the top three on the bottom on the small model it also has the touch ring but the cool thing that they've added in this is the touch feature so if
if you have that open will save your five your file five fingers down will actually pull up the Wacom settings so you can make adjustments to your cat your tablet now great thing about this these gestures with your fingers for the touch features can be used globally or you can do it application specific so if you want a different set of functions for Photoshop you can assign that and if you want something that's global when you're using Windows or or Mac you can assign that separately so I'm going to pull up Photoshop and just show you some of the cool things that you can do with this tablet and show you how I have mine configured okay
first off its touch sensitive so if I want to see how a button is configured all I have to do is just press lightly over the button and as you can see
there's an undo button
things set up there
the center basically is a press button so first one is auto scroll zoom the second one is recycle layers then brush size and then soft and hard brush and so at
there's a light actually here on the tablet that goes around tells you what you're actually set to brush size if I wanted to change the size of a brush
I'm going to put this right here in the middle of screen and if I circle counterclockwise and makes the brush larger or smaller if I want to change how soft that brushes or how hard that brush is again
brush circle
counterclockwise will make it a soft brush so that's pretty much two touch buttons and makes it so much easier from having to go over to your keyboard so often so it's a really cool thing the center area again
I can come over here and select my different tools or come back in here into the middle of the screen you know to actually drag and draw my mouse around
we'll also undo as well as that but over there and again you can configure all these buttons on how you want them to be four fingers down we'll redo so
this is one of the cool features in the tablet as well if I hold down three fingers it brings up a radial menu so I've got Wacom tablet properties brush panel that I can pull up I can save it
I can bring up portraiture one of my plugins that I use or alien skin exposure bring up Russia pasady and I set up a submenu under this so I have more functions and I can have sub menus under that as well where here I have
how much customization that you can do here so coming over here if I wanted to run a plug-in or hour of my action here for sharpening so it's automatically done that as you can see
it's done its work over here in the layers and if I wanted to undo any of that again I can just four fingers up and step all the way back through that action to go back to the beginning so let me show you some of the things that I have set up here also as well under the menu so I'm going to actually use five fingers drag down that brings up my touchscreen property so you can see exactly how almost everything is set up on the tablet and then make it just additional changes as well so I've got it set up for again just like I talked before duplicate layers undo
shift my auto scroll cycle layers brush size soft hard brush control all pan scroll the pin itself so if I pull up the pen itself I have the second button set up to toggle colors so if I wanted to change the the X&Y or the black and white colors or whatever colors selected at a time
so here are all the default properties that I have set up and it's set globally right now but again you can make this application specific so here are all my settings for Photoshop
and then you've got swipe left or right with four fingers to switch applications so if I wanted to go to a different screen or back to my desktop I can just swipe back left or right or go back and forth so so
so if I were to grab my brush here on my pin and just slightly press it does a very faint color stroke and the harder I press the darker that get and also you can see the larger it gets as well so I mean you have so much customization with this tablet
I can you know again just do that and again if I don't like any of that stuff four fingers up under and we'll undo all of that so it's really nice
I mean this thing or using a regular Mouse might be a thing of the past so like so this is just a little quick review of the tablet and showing you some of the things that it can do except it connected the USB one of the things I like about this is the USB is detachable so again if your cable ever goes bad then you can replace it with just a regular standard USB cable and the cool thing about it this tablet it actually has a little cutout for it so even if you hit it at an odd angle you're not going to really damage the USB port that easily so so this is like said awesome thing that Wacom has come out with and I can only see it getting better
some people complain about maybe a lag and stuff so forth about that you know using the touch it takes a little getting used to make sure you get the right amount of pressure to bring things up but so far
I am enjoying it
so all in all
I'm I'm really impressed with the Intuos 5 again like I said I went with the small tablet because it's portable and suits my needs for what I do and how I retouch you might like one of the bigger tablets
my next video
I'm going to be stepping into Photoshop and going to be or actually Lightroom Lightroom for since that's finally out and we're going to do some retouching with Lightroom 4 so I'm going to show you some of the things I do for portrait retouching there so I hope you've enjoyed and stay tuned
Vaughn kill reached out to me and asked if I wanted to check out their latest Android tablet and I gladly took them up on the offer and as such I should go ahead and point out that this tablet has been provided free of charge by Bonnke
I'm gonna be telling
I've decided to break the illusion a little bit mainly because this is not what the tablets gonna look like when it arrived instead of just sitting in the admittedly very nicely designed padded box it will also be wrapped in this plastic bag and have a little Quick Start Guide attached to the screen and speaking of things attached to the screen
a quad-core cortex a7 1.3 gigahertz CPU 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi bluetooth 4.2 a GPS for offline or Wi-Fi navigation a 2 megapixel front-facing camera a five megapixel rear-facing camera and even an FM radio as for the layout of this tablet on the front you have the microphone located on the bottom left hand corner as well as the front-facing camera on the top
you'll find the micro
I don't know if this is going to transfer over in the video well or not but based on what I was hearing the week o ride was a bit busier than the matrix had
but that's not necessarily a good thing because in the case of the matrix pad it wasn't tinny instead it had a bit more nuance to the audio and that means that if you're listening to music that isn't as bass heavy as the metal
I played here
undoubtedly one of the primary things people are going to be using a tablet like this for would have to be streaming services and while it has performed perfectly on
I'm gonna go ahead and say the one I've been spending the most time with recently has to be to be for those of you who don't know what to be is it is a free ad-supported streaming service that is actually not that aggressive with an
that's why you see it in all of those horror film multipacks in fact most if not all of the movies in those packs are on to be so now
I present to you a collection of 1080p a very vibrant test clip and I'll go ahead and turn off my recording lights so they don't interfere now when it comes to gaming on the matrix had s7
I decided to tax the system a little bit and play a few 3d games and I'm pleased to announce that I've had zero issue running games like Armageddon and even Dead Effect 2 not only did I have no noticeable slowdown when I get to even the more graphically intense parts but I didn't even notice a buildup of heat in the tablet which I should point out I have had to deal with on other devices in the past
I'm much prefer using a Bluetooth game controller and while I have gotten a decent amount of playtime on both of those games the one that I've really been thinking a good chunk of time into would have to be the quest by redshift
it's because it is a remaster of a game that I used to play all the time back in the day on my old Pocket PC now if only redshift would remaster another of their games in this genre legacy I spent just about as much time with that one back on my old Pocket PC and I even play it from time to time on this Palm Pilot that I found while thrifting sadly they are on record saying that they're not going to be remastering legacy for modern hardware but if you happen to know where to find a Palm OS 5 emulator for Android
I been reading the occasional novel on it but by far the biggest text-based benefit of this tablet in my eyes is that I can load it up with digital editions of whatever RPG manuals
I need this way not only do I have to not worry about carrying around a huge bag filled with books that may end up getting damaged either in transit or during the session but this is especially useful when you want to break out a game
I've noticed is missing from a lot of sub $100 Android devices and that's autofocus one of the devices that I've been playing around with recently is a $40 Android phone and while it does claim to record at 1080p it does so using a fixed focus camera and I suspect a fair degree of interpolation which is basically upscaling a smaller image with a few tweaks here and there
which in this case is 480p which makes sense giving the reduced resolution of the front-facing camera all in all I think the matrix pad s7 is a pretty dang decent device
but that's pretty much par for the course in the sub $100 Android device market however those other devices also typically have only about 8 to 16 @ gigabytes of on-board storage and are round one gigabyte of ram so
I'm a willing to make that trade-off and I'll have you know I use this tablet pretty much daily even when I'm doing my winddown at night especially due to the fact that modern versions of Android included.i
comfort settings so it doesn't even keep me awake at night if I've sparked your interest in the Matrix pad s7 you can pick it up on Amazon for around $75 I'm going to go ahead and include an affiliate link down in the description below and on that note this is your guy

this feature is something
one downside of a tablet is that there are fewer available ports however the HP Latex 2 still houses two USB 3.1 type-c ports with Thunderbolt support and one first gen USB 3.1 port as well as a headphone microphone combo jack whilst this could put some off as there is less the ability to connect to the device the ten-thirty g3 does Habs built-in Wi-Fi options and Bluetooth capabilities

and please remember to
hi there well today
high resolution runs
Windows 8 natively out of the box and it's a really really interesting workhorse tablet now one of the things that motion do really well with their tablets is they
you'll see that
basically the whole set of accessories that you could ever imagine for a tablet motion will build and they've done that with the r12 as well although I've got this pre-production version of the tablet here today
I don't have all the accessories with me but you will see more on those from us on our website or coming up over the next couple of months as we get the the shipments of those devices so the r12 has an Intel Core i5 or i7 processor inside
when we were doing some some demonstrations with the device it also has 8 gigabytes of RAM and up to 256 gigabyte hard drives installed in the device from the factory which is fantastic
PC so let's go ahead and take a close-up look at the motion r12 looking at the back of the tablet here you can see that we've got a hot-swap battery here
go get another battery
we've got two speakers
so this will connect into your vehicle dock or into a desktop docking station so when I use this device I'll basically come into my office here and plug it straight into the desktop dock and I'll have all my USB ports USB 3 ports etc connected through that but the docking connector there on the docking station this module
and that's because motion have a device called slight mate or an extension called slight mate that's an optional feature of this tablet and if it does clip into this section here it's something that's rigid in the factory and that enables expansion to include a barcode reader a serial port and also an rfid reader
and it's something that just protrudes off the bottom of the tablet about that long just slightly if you choose that option on the left-hand side facing the back of the tablet we have no ports a USB port audio in and out hdmi full-size SD card and an LTE
highly a fingerprint reader
something the motion had been doing for many many years is including those fingerprint reader systems into their devices now that Apple have put the fingerprint reader on the iPhone 5s
you can't still type your password and if you want to but being able to just swipe and login is a lot easier than typing in your password 20 times a day which can be quite frustrating above that we've got come active digitizer pen
it's got a nice thick barrel to it and it fits right into the inside the tablet there but you'll also notice that next to that pen slot there is actually a tether point here so that
the r12 is an 8 megapixel camera with an LED flash there which is really really good great for documentation and those sorts of things unfortunately was Windows 7 on the old devices we couldn't get such high resolution cameras and lastly we've got our volume buttons on the side here and you will notice that there is a fan on this device so there's an intake here for the fan and an outlet for the fan
but it is even though that fan unit is there that is actually sealed the area and we've also got some function buttons on the side on the left-hand side here that are backlit illuminated so
I can press one of those buttons there and the button that I've pressed will give a little bit of haptic feedback as well as it'll illuminate on the screen
this r12 is running
what it does enable you to do though is to actually split the screen quite comfortably and to be able to have two applications here side-by-side so I've got my Microsoft OneNote over on this side you know just digital key but if I can and on the right hand side I've got a desktop application open at the same time and we can bias or split the screen whichever way we prefer there so I'm going to go ahead and get the pen out
you can see that
it's fast it's responsive
it's it's actually
I really do need to rest my hand on the screen as I'm doing it because if I'm having to hover it's really economically quite bad so the Wacom pen system here works a treat on the motion tablet and the pen as I said before is quite a nice shape and size to use on a large device like this
the r12 is really designed for people who who are really highly mobile people who are on the go all the time and need a device that they can take with them and work on wherever they are so people who are out in the field who are working in rugged environments for example the r12 would be a really interesting and good option for them but even people like myself who
I'm really a computer guy but I do travel a lot and I spend a lot of time in the car and I'm playing to know sorts of places so having a rugged tablet for me
so so the are twelve is a really interesting option for me to be able to have this sort of hardware this sort of really high-performance and fast hardware in a nice large tablet form factor like this is really really compelling if you're looking for a rugged device and you think that the motion r12 might be of interest to you then give us a call because we do do on-site demonstrations right across Australia but not only that one of the things that we found over time with any tablet no matter what the platform no what no matter what
the operating system is that training is really essential to get the best out of the device we charge companies big corporates thousands of dollars to do that training on-site but if you buy a motion tablet from us we'll actually do that training for you free of charge
absolutely what's up guys
I've actually gone out and bought actually got this a couple months ago been using it so I can give you guys a full review on my thoughts and opinions and actual some use case scenarios and also when I got it I immediately wanted to open it and start using it
this is the root case origami folio case cover with stylus for Asus memo pad HD 7 as well as a full review of the Asus memo pad HD 7
here goes
why did
I'm not going to do the types of things on this that I do with my desktop computer so I didn't want to spend a ton of money but I saw the specs in the price point for the Asus memo pad HD 7 at Computex this year
speaking of which doing a quick unboxing here you can see as far as what comes in the box this week gets a AC adapter micro USB power cable for charging and data transfer as well as the documentation and warranty information
Asus one which is I think is like 40 or 45 bucks but let's move on to the specs for the hd7 first off the screen which is undoubtedly one of the best features of this
so that's an immediate tech one if you haven't heard of them that's because they're a bit more on the budget line but this processor has plenty of chops for handling basic tableting tasks for graphics
GPU it's not top of the line by any means I would not compare it to for instance a Tegra 4 or even a Tegra 3 for that matter when it comes to graphics
I've only done a bit of light gaming on this and it's been ok I wouldn't recommend it for the latest tablet or android games if they're pushing the 3d pixels a little bit harder but for basic gaming and day-to-day tasks
it's perfectly adequate
gigahertz antenna which is
and if you're metric user it's one hundred ninety six point eight millimeters by 120 point six millimeters by ten point eight meters and it weighs ten point seven ounces
there's also a black matte finish available although it was not available on the egg when I bought this otherwise I probably would have gone with the black and then it's also available in white pink and green glossy finishes which I have heard have a bit of a cheaper feel to them but I have the matte one which I like the billow of this plastic
it's not the greatest
although you can't really see them it does have stereo and the Sun is actually pretty decent as well and then you get a 5 megapixel rear facing camera as well as a 1.2 megapixel front facing camera which is also quite cool if you want to do video chat or that sort of thing you totally can for software it ships with Android 4.2.2
and it's just as only does some minor modifications to the UI you have an Asus keyboard and an Asus notification tray and you can fairly easily go into the settings and turn those off and switch back to the native Android keyboard and notification tray if he wants
I haven't found that necessary to do so far although I might do it with the keyboard because I'm not a huge fan of the autocomplete on it thus far you get an excuse cam app and a few other apps that integrated the camera apps actually also pretty decent as long as you have plenty of light this takes okay pictures as well although again
I can do some music and video playback so if I'm going around doing chores or cooking some food or something like that I can sort of set this up and it gives me a much larger viewable screen than say my cell phone
I have Pandora and stall so I can run some streaming music and then also play music directly off of the SD card or from my network as well which is cool while I'm at home also
I've used this with my HTPC since I have a seaton infinite TV card seating it also has an app it's five bucks but I did buy it because Steve recommended it and I'm actually quite enjoyed it
I actually used it as a replacement remote control to when my remote went out although it's working again so so I don't need it anymore but the seasoned app is also pretty useful for that
I brought it to work a few times to use it for web browsing like if I'm doing video operation or camera operating and I have some downtime so I can pop up some webpages or whatever you're in do some research look up stuff also
Drive app installed
so that's pretty much the specs and that's what I've been using it for so let's get down to some opinion here some some review stuff so I'm gonna kind of separate this out first
nice heft in the hand type of build quality that you would with like a higher-end iPad or higher end tablets that are available from Asus even for that matter so I give it a 7 for build quality
it's still sturdy enough
that's part of why
performance again is okay
it's an IPS
screen which is great to have for a tablet at this price point and then as far as a performance otherwise this versus just web browsing or navigation the snappiness of it is pretty decent
a dedicated review battery
so if you're gonna be taking this on a plane or something like that you can watch several movies of it back-to-back movies or TV shows or what not so great for long plane rides or something like that
maybe a long car ride or a car trip if you're gonna be doing video playback or web browsing that's the kind of battery life you should expect for value
I'll post a link down in the video description and if you're looking for something just kind of a step up from here the Nexus 7 from Google is a fantastic one as well
I think he did
don't forget to leave me a comment on how you felt about this tablet or if you enjoy tablets at all or if you think that this is a much more reasonable proposition especially if compared to like a an iPad Mini or something like that
hi this is
Brad Linder with Lulu feuding and this is the Acer switch alpha 12 which from this angle looks kind of like a laptop computer and it kind of is but if you turn sideways you can see that
it's also a tablet
and you can tuck the keyboard away behind the screen when it's not in use strong magnets hold things together so strong that all you really need to do is bring things close to to each other and the keyboard draws power from the tablet itself
and that's because unlike some two and ones it it really has all the specifications and the power that you would expect from a full-fledged laptop it's not exactly the easiest thing to use on your lap because you have sort of three different points to balance here
Costco exclusive that is has core i5 eight gigabytes of RAM 256 gigabytes of storage and comes with a keyboard and the pen the pen is an optional $50 accessory
so if you think about this as starting at $5.99 it's much cheaper than an entry-level Microsoft Surface pro 4 for example which starts at 899 and that price includes the pen but not the keyboard and that has a Core M series processor as opposed to core i3 for the entry-level version of this tablet
the the tablet has power volume and windows buttons here on the side brushed aluminum rear panel five megapixel camera which is just out of view here there this from five megapixel rear camera micro SD card slot
which is the reason
adapter looks more like something you would expect from from a laptop and you know a small compact tablet and it takes a couple hours to fully charge the tablet in terms of battery life
it should get
Acer says up to 8 hours but more realistically if you're using it with Wi-Fi or if you're watching videos 5 to 6 hours in my tests maybe more like 4 to 6 hours depending what you're doing
I find it a little bit heavy at 2 pounds to hold in your hands for an extended period you can use it in tablet mode by propping it down on a desk of course or you could always just prop it up and use it
it's only got about four to six hours of battery life so you might want to carry that charger with you if you'd need to have extended time beyond that that's really kind of the biggest downside and the fact that it's a little bit hard to balance
maybe two keys
screen 2165 1440 pixels
for the most part there are some applications that can be a little bit tricky to deal with at that resolution so it does support continuum mode and that means that if I detach
I have the option of switching automatically to this sort of desktop or a notebook style user interface and then when I launch applications they launch in full-screen mode and if I wanted to launch the second application I'd have the option of sort of doing split screen so I've got a Kindle here and I can watch a video and read a book at the same time or whatever it is that you want to do I guess so applications
it didn't take us out of continuum here try it again but I do find that applications that are not really optimized for Windows 10 can be a little bit trickier
everything works pretty nicely
it's a very responsive system and I find it's on par with other systems with core i5 skylake CPUs for instance the reason I want to open this app though is okay
12 inch display
that means a lot of pixel packed in per inch and the pen comes in handy just tap to the screen there because it gives you a fine tip for tapping icons that might be too hard to reach with just your fingers now you could
I've been editing
I was just using my fingers actually not having too much difficulty but sometimes you'll hit the wrong one when you wanted to hit a different one so so it is nice to have the pen for fine input when you're dealing with some of those applications that might otherwise give you difficulty in high resolution screens
my artwork is not great so for me the $50 accessory is not necessarily the top of the list of things that I would want but it is also nice when you're using a tablet to be able to hover so I'm not touching the screen but you can see that it's highlighting certain things below me or I can move things around using it so there's certain Windows applications that are easier to interact with with a pen if you're not using a mouse and keyboard so the pen works pretty well and so do other accessories like I'm going to go ahead and plug in gamepad here and show you that we can even do some gaming now
xbox tile controllers
graphics are pretty smooth
it is pretty responsive
and that's all
I think there's a lot to like about this particular device if you are in the market for a two-in-one device that can work either as tablet or as a notebook when you're not using a keyboard as I mentioned you can either detach it and then instead of having a two point eight pound laptop
down on top
I'm not entirely sure
what the material is it does sort of collect dust so it doesn't take very long to start looking kind of dirty but it feels nice and and it gives you something sort of nice to rest your palms on when you're using the tablet and as you can see automatically wakes up from sleep when it detects that you've opened and closed the screen should go to sleep and it should wake up
it can take a moment to wake up so it doesn't always recognize that you've done that and I found that after if it's been turned off for a little while sometimes you have to press and hold the button for maybe three or four seconds instead of just tapping it for it to come back on the light should glow but it's kind of awkwardly placed to see it when you're looking at the front of the screen but I'm going to head and tap it you can see is glowing and then the screen did just come back on
doing other things that you might want to do on a tablet that is also a laptop with an $800 configuration of the Acer switch alpha 12 and prices start at $5.99 and go up to a little over $1,000 depending on the configuration pen is a $50 accessory
it's by me berry
and that's the
you also get the plug here you also get adapter as well so you can put usb in as well it also takes um sim card as well so bear that in mind
so you've got the advantage of putting a free a 4g or 5g sim and use it that way as well so they give you adapter for that it comes with a user manual here as well it comes with a cleaning cloth and then it comes with this a flip case as well so it's perfect for watching films and stuff like that so you can put in a certain way and watch films on it
let me show you that ones as well comes with a nice bluetooth keyboard as well so this keyboard you switch on here and literally just connect it by bluetooth and you can use this keyboard so it acts like a computer full-on computer
that's the usb uh usb that connects you can just connect it to this and it will operate that way or you can just connect it to the bluetooth keyboard
let me just put that back in and also you got the switch on and off button there as well now so you got those as well so it comes with a lot of attachments
um jack there with the volume up and down and the the power button there and they are made out of metal and buttons as well so the build quality is amazing there at the top
it's the worst thing when you don't have nails it's difficult to really open this but this is where the this is where the sim card goes in bear with me okay
one sim two
it also comes with a rear camera with a flash as well and the speakers are at the bottom here and at the front it also has a front camera as well and to clean this all right so it has a 10.1 inch ips screen as well and the screen resolution is 1280 800 ips
it's made out of metal so that this whole bit is made out of aluminium metal a bit of plastic at the top here but it's overall just a brilliant tablet
okay i'm sure it was switched on okay so i've connected it now and it says the me baby when he starts up let me just lower the brightness so i can show you okay so it takes a bit of time to stop
uh the battery
so that gives you around 30 days of standby time around five hours of video playback so you can watch films and stuff but it requires around four hours to charge up but 8000 mah battery capacity is brilliant
plus another thing i love about this is that it has a very loud speaker as well built into this it has a 64 gig battery internal memory and 11.8
okay um opera
you know
it's not the best
so that's the best thing the main thing is it has a good ram as well 4 gig ram 64 gig internal memory and that's enough to download a lot of games and apps and stuff and store um photos videos etc and it's just a useful tablet okay affordable and it has a lot of comes with a lot of accessories so i do highly recommend it and i'm promise you you wouldn't be disappointed with this tablet
it might be affordable okay 120 pounds but the fact that it comes with a lot of accessories the build quality is amazing and it operates very smoothly as well so thank you for watching my video
Android tablet yay so
this is hard strong
Banco so thank you so much for sending this awesome product from us so we can't wait to try it out check out what's inside here is the iPad it comes in and here's a look at the iPad
there's a stem where you can just pull it out and you can stand it up like this comes with a user guide and all this stuff alright so this is the iPad
it's very thick
this is the iPad
this also paired account the parents can make so they can see what their kids are doing so they can just sign up for a free account and just check
it responds really fast
once you go in here you can see lots of apps like Gmail Google Go assistant and maps go there's also YouTube so once you open YouTube you can watch many videos like Jim and Jesse see
Play Store or if you check out the pre-installed games in kiddos distress games and you can see so many educational games that kids can play this coloring games ABCs
here's the result so
how about you
what's your favorite boy
yeah yeah man
Oh game play
who's pretty amazing right
Jesse why so
that's it guys
please like this video
share with your friends
subscribe to our channel
so here's the question
so we're just gonna skip that and focus on the good stuff but this is still an unboxing video so please enjoy this pseudo asmr unboxing with background music before we jump into the actual review do so all right chad
but at the same time that is one of the main reasons it manages to be in a more affordable price range of 550 dollars whereas higher resolution tablets are typically thousands of dollars
the tablet supports windows 7 or later mac os 10.12 or later as well as android if you want to use it with an android tablet if for some reason
i think your priority should be getting a new computer instead of a new tablet you absolute dinosaur and that's it for the relevant specifications if you need any more
the tablet i usually use has a multitude of shortcut keys on the side that i use frequently so i thought this would be more of a concern but i just plugged in a keyboard and got used to using the keyboard shortcuts
very quickly the reasons i do like the lack of shortcut keys is because it makes it look very sleek and refined to just have a screen and nothing else and also the software is very simple because the only key mapping to do is on the pen which has two buttons but unfortunately no eraser on the other end but that's not really a big deal it's kind of just a nice addition if it does include it
adobe animate and to get it to work with adobe animate i had to enable windows ink and game mode in the queen software as well as the windows ink beta option in adobe animate this did take a bit of troubleshooting to figure out and i personally try to avoid using windows ink
if i can but that's the only way i could get it to work or else it would make these weird blips at the start of every stroke this manifested itself differently in the other drawing program
i used which is paint tool psi because the pressure sensitivity did not work initially but everything worked fine after i enabled the options i mentioned before secondly the pen had some trouble doing some small interface things which is the best way i can describe it
adobe animate is that it was either very difficult or impossible to drag the effective region of the onion skin which you can see here all right so i'm just gonna turn on onion skin
oh my god okay
why isn't this moving
please onion skin
this isn't a deal breaker at all and is very specific to adobe animate but i obviously can't test every art program so it's hard to say if there will be similar problems depending on what software you use the last and probably the most annoying thing i encountered is that my keyboard would be partially disabled if the pen was active
they're not working again
i don't understand wait
is it because my
i think it's because my cursor like i was keeping my mouse floating on the screen that it wouldn't work which is not something i've had a problem with before
keyboard shortcuts like undo redo and tool selection worked fine which is much more important basically i could not have my pen touching or even hovering on the screen if i wanted to type once again i wouldn't say this is annoying enough to be a deal breaker
comfy pen and the etched glass feels very nice to draw on the cons are that typing is disabled while the pen is active potential trouble with small ui interactions depending on what program you use and windows ink is required
large screen tablet
yes i definitely would
feel free to give me a follow on twitch i'm not streaming at the moment because of classes but at least you'll know when i do stream again anyway thanks bye
actually we aren't only referring to the big names from the chinese marketplace even small time businesses such as chewy and umidigi have upped their game when it comes to designing their goods
inch fhd screen
there's a hybrid
double sim card slot
it's somewhat reflective however
it's not something that you can't manage so general you won't be disappointed with its own screen quality on paper the chewy high pad lte includes whatever you'd want for conducting easily and 90 of the time you'll have a smooth encounter on the pill but there are instances we experienced a couple of glitches while opening multiple programs which we assume is due to its restricted 3 gigabytes ram
however it's possible to trigger the duraspeed attribute from the settings that appear to accelerate things to a sensible extent in general ui including programs work better with duraspeed switched on but notice that
lte are 5 mp
coming out dull
the pill could load web pages when we had been using it a couple of rooms away in the router a number of my smartphones fight to locate wfi sign in that area so we had been pleased to observe that the chuwi ipad lte load web pages and stream videos with no major hiccups
the battery is one place in which the chuwi high pad lte pill shouldn't disappoint and to a fantastic extent it succeeds to uphold its individuality as a sizeable 7000 milliamp hours battery tablet computer
which means you will need to experience this every alternative day nevertheless for many consumers the chuwi ipad lte must give over the usual day's battery lifetime incomplete so you won't need to plug it every couple of hours into the socket
there's nothing to discuss
fancy stuff today
mobile internet device
box chip cortex a8 on processor with a mali-400 GPU so that's a sort of cheaper variant of the one year Earth's processor so it's not a snapdragon for example 512 megabyte ddr system memory ddr3
get your bite left after the OS and all that stuff expanded up to 30 60 your voice with my first day which means you can pop a 32 gig card in it actually ordered a 16 gig card from each of them cartoons for the plane
oh really five hours
and that's something
because if any deviance on the internet were to see them it'd be so blocky that will be able to ask you back up lights and his children ok stereo speakers
don't see that happening
buzz biax access operate
so they're going to try and sell us out awesome access the popular social foods such as Facebook and Twitter while they're too young for all that then I've been dating till their 25 and communication by the internet using apps such as Skype
that'd be quite cool because if I got one each and we're on the Wi-Fi they can actually skype each other from different ends of the house if you're as old as I am
you probably remember things like little walkie-talkies which have the range of making through a small war if it didn't have bricks in it and you talk to your sibling that way and unfortunately
I'm a little bit
after a day at work down the mines a right so 7-inch android from I got incentive I suppose b747 99 delivered on e by Don common in the UK
yeah the thing is these are probably gonna be fairly disposable so there you go right probably best is feel better camera view now and yeah even though okay so many buddy actually cares about these spurious claims that mounted on the box
fill your boots right
busby seven quick start
indeed description of device
we would be buying them the bus be seven hours for file transfer in three different ways by the USB OTG port when click through a PC blah blah blah blah blah blah blah for an external
recycling doo de doo
we'll keep them meet until the main course a really nice piece of foam which you can use for your own purposes and piece of cardboard which packs out the rest of the otherwise completely empty box
what's this micro
let's have elite well
Here I am yes
hello um screen protector
that looks pretty
what can you expect
that's nice couple of marks on the work there but other than that caution do not open the casing due to risk of electric shock hmm and on this side we've got to get out into Shari on this side
and here's the land
now it's quite dark
doo doo doo doo
where's the Play Store
mmm doing a place
to of course
everything exists them
yes ok so
move my monitor
I see it's dropped
keep shopping a bug
that's all so so
so 1156 p.m.
all of the time
no recent apps turn your volume up and down with these buttons here back to the desktop couple of eggs so yeah it's quite responsive and I've got to say the screen works really well
it's a lot better than i was expecting for the low low price that we go to music what music we've got put some generic stuff on how about a bit valve
so what is this
ok they also use is really quite quiet but that's not a problem that we got some headphones for them from the plane anyway so they won't annoy the other travelers such as stereo music coming out there apparently anyway enough of that
let's stop it because unfortunately if I do this for too long YouTube will flag my video and promptly delete it and send the YouTube ninjas round to beat me within an inch of my life so let's go back
here's me hello
I have noticed
that's probably a bit to do with the quality of things out that the zoom in was quite nicely there you know and for what it is that would probably do quite a good video call
I say whoa yeah
so how's that hello look ready for my close-up mr. B DeMille so this is the camera working the benefit of around and 1500 watts of light so your success is giving well out there and I did this into the video itself okay
Hugh bricks that's right
YouTube did it
Rovio oh yes
I wouldn't mind having a pound less than rovio okay loading time so I want to play tunes no idea so this is pretty much angry birds as everybody knows that
I completely suck at angry birds but I think it also say this runs pretty well assume all the way in here as close as I can and some on a dolly here so it's a tough research going next
yeah so there
and thank
and you can't really sell this because the encoding the video in the retailing the quality is pretty good that will keep them nice and happy on the plane anyway
and it's windows
detachable time it's been a while since lenovo made a detachable tablet this is the thinkpad x12 gen1 because well it's the first generation so in 2018 they made the thinkpad x1 tablet and nothing much happened so obviously this is kind of a microsoft surface style clone and detachable because yonder thinkpad style keyboard attaches with pogo pins just like it would on a surface and you can guess already
one of the selling points for competitors to the microsoft surface other than durability that we'll talk about that lenovo makes with their products like this and dell makes some too is the fact that microsoft doesn't update the surface generations very quickly so often the cpu falls behind all that sort of thing
the core i5 a couple of different you want v pro you got a core i7 and the core i3 because that's how the core i3 is that one is just intel uhd graphics but i5 and i7 you'll get iris xe graphics for a nice graphics boost it's a 3x2 aspect ratio display not as high resolution as surface pro though this is full hd plus so 1920 by 1280 resolutions not bad
hard to use kind of glossy and it supports both the included digital pen the lenovo digital pen basic edition and they have a fancier pants one that includes tilt support also anyway that's included in the box and so is the keyboard so that makes the price a little bit more amenable starts around 100 bucks if you get that base core i3 model and something
but yes it is a little bit flexy and makes a bit of kind of a hollow sound when you type on it and this is about as think paddy as you can get while being only 12.3 inches in size
nice tactile feel and key travel on the usual smile shape keys and a little bit of indentation so your fingers find that home place a decent trackpad on board of course as well
no fussing just works that way on the other hand because it's not bluetooth you do have to attach it if you wish to use it with the tablet and it has the usual red eraser
it's quite pleasant
also there is optional
4g lte that's cat 9 not as fast as the cat 16 we see in some other thing pads probably a size limitation ram is going to be soldered on board here as you might guess
and it has a ssd up to one terabyte so you get 256 or 512 or one terabyte ssd and that is nvme in terms of build quality compared to something like surface pro not that surface pro feels at all flimsy but it feels very much like a designer consumer kind of product where you don't want to just toss around anywhere
obviously but it's a little more durable than something like surface pro ports on this given the fact that it is a tiny tablet not too bad we have thunderball 4 which comes with the latest intel 11th gen cpu
all that sort of thing or go an additional usb c port that is gen 1 3.2 it does support display out and you have a headphone jack on board as you might expect and a nano sim card slot if you go with that 4g option for biometrics we have a fingerprint scanner built into the keyboard deck a windows
hello ir camera
and the usual
they claim 400
i have a little bit of a preference for the surface pro when it comes to that because they really have tweaked that a lot that uses entry technology which i usually prefer less for art but in this case i think this one's not bad and again you can get optional
it's 4096 pressure levels
that's included with us
models is 29
so not too bad
in terms of performance it reminds me a lot of the thinkpad x1 nano which is a good thing because that one was a solid performer really verging on regular ultrabook levels of performance and in a tiny tablet like this
that's pretty good
doing things like photoshop
this will depend obviously what you're going to do with it and how bright you have it set at 200 nits of brightness doing mixed productivity streaming some video a little bit of photoshop we managed about seven to eight hours which is really good
and that's not trying
you know wherever you want to put it you can put it just like a surface and it goes to almost completely flat which i think is kind of comfortable for note-taking um you poke at it
they've done a nice job with that for cameras on this we have a five megapixel front-facing webcam so you'll look better and clearer than average compared to most ultrabooks that have a 720p webcam
actually you know
who you know people who might do this and actually even drop it and it might survive that sort of thing pretty good performance here from intel 11th gen low power cpus even get iris xc graphics
too by detachable standards
hello hey look
Box tough here
it is
hopefully not ashen is
Nydia tore something
I'm arguing with that
what's inside a tablet
we have power adapter
yes very important and an interesting adapter never seen one of these before it adapts from the HDMI out on the tablet to Ethernet and VGA which is quite a useful little thing you know to connect an old monitor also interesting that they've somehow hacked an Ethernet port through an HDMI connection hmm must be using extra pins or possibly dark sorcery the only other thing in the Box is this
Android laptop yep yep
let's start that again
so push your finger through however there's always a dark cloud on the horizon and this time it's the button see the little button here with a Windows logo on press that it's all sunk in one side and it feels all squidgy horrible
it's it's properly flush
we are are
we have power adapter
we've reviewed recently so make of that more - will okay as you can use the eyes and your face to discover it's basically Windows 7 but on a tablet
I'm sure you know what kind of programs run on windows and all that kind of thing but we must look at the technical frippery of such devices core you know how does the touchscreen work well
improve tablet interface which they're going to release in a few months as is my understanding but at the moment all we've got is this so let's just look at it right if you touch the capacitive screen with your finger
here it goes
let's type something in
Bing and up comes a fully featured lovely keyboard to type in one of the main features of this keyboards you might noticed is to completely obscure the text box
you're typing in
I mean I can't see what I'm typing so if I'm doing an important internet search for a potato have I typed in potato correctly we assume so you have to actually close it down off we go sorry
I have big hands and chunky fingers for strangling badges and that makes it slightly difficult for me to touch some of the smaller icons at times particularly when I'm looking through the viewfinder or a camcorder anyway
let's move that monitor
shot marvelous there
I've tried about six of them and they're all completely different and they're all massively superior to this in pretty much every manner so if you were to get one of these spend a few hours to download them and see which one you think is bestest
Apple Newton there
think about that
I'm super important
why actually walk
rude and childish
we are fantastic
very very
what you're typing into
you'll have more fun
that's in pixels
not 2 nautical miles
rubble actually being windows
Bob boom trust me
CPU at one point
six six of those magic gigahertz two of them listed because it is of course a dual-core processor it's also got one gigabyte of RAM it's got I think sixteen gigabytes of on-board storage
fullscreen mean come back
the answer is yes
I get that so often right and yeah it will play 720p h.264 but it seems to choke on it if it's in the old MKV wrapper and as most people seem to transport their large video files in MKV these days
it doesn't seem to matter what you're doing if you're just kind of looking at things on the screen with the brightness down you'll get about three-and-a-half hours max if you're doing fairly intensive stuff
also odd for a tablet running my hand across the back here which of course can't seize is not in the frame there you can see me doing that and air coming at the back and slight fan noise because yeah it's powerful enough to need a fan because the parts get hot which is a bit of a surprise really cuz you know not something you expect from a tablet but when you think of what's in it
go on then
look my head
do you remember
I don't think well there's a program called insane which is not showing here so we'll have to do search for it and which is kind of well they say if something has been developed with the courier whether that's true or not I'm not hundred percent sure oh I put two eyes look
Shh really I should have downloaded by the third party keyboards but you know I wanted to keep it pure for the review Inc saying there it is clicky clicky there is no email program
oh yes
don't worry about that
yeah it's in book and you can write things on it oh it's a very childish day-to-day and you know bank notes of things and put images on it and everything connects up nicely to your email making it a really fantastically good note-taking service for the old laptops
something else is interesting
go a bit doing something very clever that we don't understand but eventually after a few thousand years just takes me longer where the dog is going to revolve into another life-form
but that's a really nice program if you are online or note-taking on the move of course another really good method of taking notes on the move is a pen the bit of paper but let's not get into that argument
good buying sane right
oh yeah right well
the iPad is physically
you know so just sticking a USB thing in whatever you fancy if you just want to get video one to watch it takes ten seconds whereas for the iPad you tend to have to convert it and spend the rest of your life mucking around with iTunes in the hope
in fact that's why
I made a point of briefly showing you Inc signs as one of the few things there actually is for Windows whereas obviously every single thing for the iOS is very much optimized for the experience again
it's so difficult
well here's the thing
the price of this particular device is 400 dollars which is about 250 pounds if you want an upgraded one with 2 gigabytes of RAM and 32 gigabytes of memory is 460 dollars
or about 290 pounds
to be honest
I would probably recommend that for these small extra outlay if you are considering getting one something you must take into account for the price of this though the windows 7 in they stick on it
I believe is only a 30-day trial so you'll have to factor in the cost of sort of full windows 7 for yourself if you are getting one but still that's an awful lot cheaper than an iPad in it
it is as simple as that right two specific examples and this has been great for me because all I want is to be able to shove video onto something and take it with me to meetings and that and you know maybe Google pornography on the train
I wish the battery lasts a bit longer but the fact that I can just shove video on and it works as long as it isn't a high-definition MKV and that I produced anything in that format but hey you might want to do one day
and that's been very very good and bigger surprise for me as I showed it to a friend who has no interest in mobile computing at all's never laptop or a smartphone likes to leave all that stuff at home after at 5 minutes of showing it to Marty straight
Thema just saw
I need one now
because as part of his job he speaks to people on skype all the time so what he's done is he's clipped on this of HD webcam thing he has to the top just has it sitting there as a completely separate computer
overnight seeding torrent files for sort of emulating old computers and that and he's now looking into plugging into an external hard drive into it and sort of using it as a file around his house
would he mmm
anyway that's completely irrelevant
let's take a moment to actually think about how nice it is to view comics on this screen using whatever comic reading software you fancy comics so then in conclusion
hi this is
the drivers are inside this 8 gig memory so you can install the drivers from the memory or you can just go to their website to download the drivers to install them
RPS this report rate means that the graphics tablet is going to send back some signal to determine where your stylus is so at any point in time even know where your stylus is so the resolution and the report rate works together to give you that accuracy and this is a 10mm which is a 1 cm reading hard
let's open this up
they have a
I'll show that to you later on this use you need to connect it to the USB port of your computer so this is the new micro USB port basically the type of pot you use to charge your Android phones and I think this is probably there a geek memory card which is which I can't remove it so that's all about the tablet
it's a nice booty and Slyke there is a pack of extra nips so these are the pen tips part I think 8 or 9 them and this is the manual
it's the pen design
this part is some sort of a mat surface and this part is more a semi-matte surface that is the power cable to charge the stallers and this is the pen
holder comes with replaceable
close it like this
night's L shape so the cable goes to the top so now I can rest my hands here without interfering with the cable and I can press the physical shortcut buttons here very easily and this is the pen again just now as I was trying to put the cap onto the back of the hand
I'm going to show you some of the settings that the tablet driver is capable of so after you have installed the driver you can go to this hotspot here and look for the small icon here here
there's no option here
this is the one setting button and you can set all the different keyboard shortcuts to the physical buttons as well as the soft key buttons right at the top of the tablet
it's very easy to set keyboard so just choose the physical key that you want from this drop-down box and then choose the keyboard shortcut that you want it to assign to that is all and press apply
basically the whole tablet to this so it's a one-to-one match so there's not a lot of settings from the tablet driver but it's all the very crucial settings and that's all and if you want to uninstall the driver for whatever reason let me show it to you where we can do that so when you're at this pitch where you can uninstall all the different apps on your computer do a search for tablet and this option here uninstalled have that drop device driver
I'm going to use Photoshop first this is Photoshop cs6 if you happen to be using a Windows tablet you may have this thing called the wind head driver you might want to uninstall that because reown is going to install their own version of the wind tab driver and if you have two versions of wind type driver is going to cause features so it is best to uninstall the one that you have and use who yawns version I spent quite a long time troubleshooting
it is fine
I press it immediately
I have also assigned the buttons here for zooming increasing the brush size choosing the brush to and erase the two and they all work very well so now let me pick a brush
I'll show you the strokes that you can create so let me show you some instruct step transition into thicker strokes and thick strokes that goes too thin and some very quick art strokes to let you see how well the Lions taper
now the lines
Wacom tablets in the sense that take a look here when it tapers to this and it cuts down our rudder properly and then you get one thin line like this welcome tablets
they are much smoother
this is an example
I have a switch on the clock in here and let me try and draw the same strokes again so now the strokes they taper much more gradually India much closer to the way
there's a problem
there's no lag whatsoever the lines they come out as fast as I put them down onto that tablet so this is quite good all right so let me close Photoshop and move on to Adobe Illustrator Adobe Illustrator
oops where's my brush
I can say that I want to adjust the size based on pressure and I want as much variation as possible so let me click OK and do the same example word gain then to take thick to thin so strokes are very smooth on Adobe Illustrator no issues at all let me close this and switch to the next software this is Miss chief
i'm actually not too familiar with ping - sigh but I guess you can use it so in Josiah supports pressure as well so these are the light strokes and these are the thick strokes and this is the transition you can get a very smooth transition
no problems with painters
I next is critter
Wacom Bamboo paper
this is well alright
let me zoom in closer for you to see so here you can see that tapers quite sharply and you get that thin line again just like you would in
Adobe Photoshop Rihanna is a very aggressive company at pushing out new tablet products at affordable prices to compete with Wacom and with the nucleon one zero six zero plus
they are not very nice so if you are an artist who likes to crosshatch a lot with fake blinds then this might not be the tablet for you but just now
Pro is not free but if you do buy it I think it's a very useful plug-in because it can smooth out all the curves and it makes your strokes even more gradual when it comes to transition when it comes to tapering
you can find them there and if you want to buy this tablet you can do so through their Amazon affiliate links on my text review to support my youtube channel and my blog
thanks for watching
Android phones...
The DragonTouch Max
And on the back
the cameras can handle.
10 can accept up to 128 gig micro SD cards. This is a great feature because the 32 gig built-in storage can easily fill up with apps and other media.
To use this just go to Google Maps while you're on WiFi and then download the location maps that you need. And now while you're on the go step-by-step directions are available without a cellular network.
Then tap on Settings.
Here select External Mic.
And now the Max
enjoy this video
they downloaded the installer
it's pretty easy
which you can customize and also one around button dress it up for something also the pen have two keys that you can customize as well the pin inside the pen is very easy to pull out
the half blow i also received is a good thing to use as well so you don't need to dirty or graphic double because if you do the dirt on the screen will get kind of stuck and it's pretty hard to draw on the screen
for no reason all the lights appeared while i was zooming in and out it all appeared after a while of using this product so i pissed around on my desktop when i didn't have my laptop charging i could be in my bed and drive without being a laptop or graphic double connected into socket the battery in the laptop
well if you live with the three ceilings all your stuff can get damaged pretty easily so now at the display i want 2 centimeters scratch that is not noticeable
overall of this tablet this product is very very good and i would even recommend it to beginners like me or even some people that don't have enough money for expensive graphic depot and are looking for the best that they can buy so i recommend it
hey how's it going
that's how we go
it's rugged bro's review
let's review this beautiful
open it up
that's so pretty
so that's cool
it's a little
it's it starts hustling
you'll hear it
it gets hot
but that's okay
okay so you're flying through stuff but here's the pen it comes with and uh it's a mighty machine i know it's a last year's model or actually you know two years now but if you can find it for cheaper than i got it twelve hundred dollars then you know
thanks for watching this
but it's sweet
and it's real nice
everything works really well
obs works on it
you know i'm streaming
stay tuned thanks
I had some pretty low expectations to be honest with you on this tablet so with especially with the screen and I was to be honest with you with the resolution of 480 by 800
it's it's just terrible
it's an emulators
MDS games and other stuff but that's the bestest at the point um I played these and obviously there was some lag and then just transitioning in and out or multitasking from one app to the other it lags as well and yeah
I guess that's Android
I was I was expecting something a lot worse along the lines but I can't say it's impressed me too much though but for the price room because of the price range of being at around $60 it's not a bad tablet but if it was let's say anything more than that then it would be terrible
I would I mean overall I'd give this a 3 out of 5 stars so I mean if you're looking for a tablet to you know watch some videos here and there and browse the web play a little game here and there maybe not games because it lags a little but mainly for browsing and some videos if you don't care about quality and if you want to save money this is a tablet good to go for maybe
maybe not but yeah
thanks for watching
I pretty much only do animation in flash and so this review will reflect on my own type of use and today I'll be reviewing the Galman s 56 K and M 106 K
meaning you can hover your stylus up to a centimeter above the tablet in order for it to register on the back you have a little bit more info on the specs
this tablet has 4000
into one
we have the stylus pen which has a rubber grip and two programmable buttons this is the USB connector cable the battery for the stylus it takes one triple a my first tablet
most styluses
we're off the bat
I'm used to I actually use a Cintiq search in HD right now and that one has a more glossy feel on the screen as opposed to this one where it's a little bit more textured
it's not exactly matte but yeah it's textured and it's it's not something that you can't get used to so it should be you okay in the long run so just testing the pressure sensitivity
Here I am testing out the pressures pressing lightly and then pressing a little bit more heavier but I don't normally draw with sensitivities so it doesn't really affect me much but it
sometimes that might be a driver problem but that actually wasn't a Jer that was me like just you know as an example but getting used to the size of the tablet is another another thing because it's actually like way smaller than the 13 HD that I have so the scaling of the tablet would be different
what a lot of people might not remember to do is in the in the tablet settings once you install all the drivers and stuff they should open this up and actually adjust things to your liking like here you could program your your buttons to whatever shortcuts
you'd like whether it's undo or you know the brush or the eraser tool here you can adjust the sensitivity so if you want that heavy pressure but not actually press that hard on your pen
this is just a test if your pressures actually work and yes they work in the Advanced Settings this is what's important in the scaling of your your work area so if by default this would be at full area meaning this square is actually the square
well the active area on the tablet and this would cause a problem because it depends on the size of them of the monitor that you're working on so my resolution is 1920 by 1080 and that would not match the dimensions of my tablet because it's it's not that ratio so what ends up happening is that if let's say here's a good example on how to test this previously
I showed that there were kind of like a grid of dots on the tablet so if I were to follow the grid on the tablet and actually trace out a square
this is the the ratio difference of the tablets and the screen that you're working on and fix that you go here and oh not there go to advanced settings and then match the screen ratio
so now you could
and the top part of the tablet so right now this is the top of my screen but this is not the top of the work area on my tablet because it's basically cropped it out so that it would match the resolution now if I drew a square using the grid on the tablet
basically draw the thing
I judge how comfortable I am on the on the tablet so first I draw the head of course I'm gonna draw only probably the top part of my body and I've been playing with this tablet for maybe a week
I'd say I'm still the most comfortable on this untick Cintiq but then again you know I haven't really been using regular non monitor tablets in like a long time and you can notice like some some lines are kind of jittered because I'm just not used to drawing like this
Dominic's in color
I will do it and there's my character I can tweak it around if you know I want to go full perfectionist mode but you know this demonstration shows that yes I could still drawn a character it would definitely took longer than it would on my regular tablet
I like it if I needed like a backup tablet or you know if I needed to go somewhere and I didn't want to bring my whole tablet set up then I definitely just bring this because you know it's really thin
I like it you
IPS screen technology front and rear camera CPU and bright certified as well as the solid state II MMC room which is 32 gigabytes and the memory can extend up to 128 gigabytes using the micro SD card
now in my video
that what you are expecting in a packaging and in the product so by the end of the video user have an idea that is that product for them or not so that video is no difference so first to start with
come with eight inch
we're in the front
surface on the back of the tablet is matte finish and a rough InDesign which is works as an anti slip as well you can easily grab the tablet in your hand without being having a risk of dropping it on the back of tablet you also have a small speaker
all typical inputs and output ports are available on the top starting with one microUSB port for charging micro SD card which supports up to 128 gigabyte of micro sd card
it only took me five minute to configure this whole tablet and once it was done straight away good to go and ready to use for me now in terms of first look while of running it actually
it's a crisp and clear and our response of the touchscreen is not that bad at all is pretty decent by going into it and you can simply scroll down with an awl up and down off your Android screens no problem whatsoever
you can also wirelessly
check that if there is any update available or not it will exactly tell you if there is a new update available if it is just go ahead with the upgrade and you get the latest version that will also come with the Bluetooth capability of running 4.2 version
4 point 2 or higher event tablet also covers 32 gigabyte a froma which we are only using 18 percent you can install the micro SD card which can go up to 128 gigabytes
it's got about 5.4
you can also customise your whole a tablet that have you wanted in terms of sound navigation display as well where you can change the resolution or the brightness of your display - which is very nicely done at the moment we are an 80% you technically some time you really don't need 80% to be honest with you as much you reduce it
let's search it
the writing is performance is pretty decent as well and do consider subscribing to my channel as well now here on my channel you will be seeing the reviews from my side
a user would like to have starting with the security cameras product for your cars - camera speakers and stuff like that if that is something you are interested in why not consider subscribing - now let's have a look into the video samples and as you can see that it come up with a very crisp quality
I'm going to keep adding multiple tabs in there and check out this performance that it's not lagging or anything like that so see I've keep adding new tabs into it and it's been working fine actually you know
not bad actually
today's deals go
open up straight away without any problem and touch screen is a very responsive as well for the navigation purpose yeah now tablet is also equipped with the FM receiver to that
now tablet does not come with the extra piece of earphones at all so you have to use your own and it's always good to have an application as well as a hardware built-in on the back to enjoy the FM on your tablet as well now here
on this tablet
it's pretty alright
actually start that bad
aren't you well
it's not bad actually
just works great without any problem and I can maybe get as well so the internet is speed our I would say the network is field is pretty decent as well
that is that tablet
let's start with the
YouTube Full HD ones
yes you can
so that's not bad at all on top of it you also have a bonus of FM receiver in it as well which is great but checking this all on that basis
thank you very much for watching this video and if you liked this video why not hit the thumbs up button and subscribe for more see ya then guys bye for now
hi this is
I six Air 3G
it's nine point
iPad size tablet
I want to save my Wi-Fi up here is it's not the strongest it does get a signal in my third floor office whereas some devices with weaker wireless cards don't but it's not as fast as it could be up here so certain things might not look as quick as they could so we've got the Google Play Store
now it's kind of hard to tell from here but one thing that I've noticed is that it can look a little bit grainy if you look up close and I think that has more to do with the coding
but it is a
it's very responsive
it's pretty fast
is that when it comes to touch friendly tablet style applications like that in addition to sort of desktop or not desktop but in addition to you know things like web browsers which worked as fine on
there's a lot of applications for tablets they're available in Google Play which aren't available at least as of the recording of this video in the Windows Store but Windows has a couple of advantages to it
now that could change in the future as more apps become available but in order to sort of make myself use this more as a Windows tablet I got myself a Bluetooth keyboard and you can pair it pretty easily with the tablet and use it for typing and that makes it more of a desktop style experience
I'm gonna go ahead
USB port here now if you had a bluetooth mouse and a Bluetooth keyboard then you wouldn't have to use up the slot and you could charge it while you're using it because that is the charging port as well as USB port or you can plug in other devices like a USB flash drive there's also a micro SD card slot and a SIM card slot because it does support 3G although it doesn't necessarily support all of your u.s. networks I'm gonna head and log in here and not show you my Windows password while I'm at it and again you can see that
Start menu and it does have access to the Windows Store and you can download applications and as Windows 10 becomes available in the future of Microsoft really is courting developers of mobile applications to try to bring Android and iOS apps and other things to the Windows Store
and there's there's a fair number of apps in here it's just that I've been using Android for a number of years and most of the apps many of the apps that I really want to be using on tablets are available for Android
so it's nice to have that option but anyway so let's go ahead and minimize or close that switch to desktop and now you can see that with a keyboard and mouse
what's going to happen
is the tablet will
it's a IPS display
so it's not exactly a supercomputer and there's no easy way to upgrade it but I found that I can surf the web with a dozen browser tabs open while occasionally watching videos and doing other things there are some things that are a little bit weird that you need to keep in mind one is that
I should just double pics the pixels for everything and I'll make it look bigger so it's comfortable to view and the same thing happens with the text and the menus and everything else if you look real close not only
it's kind of you
Windows settings but in order for everything to look sort of comfortable and easy to read having everything set to about 200% scaling is pretty handy is loaded yet there we go
let's go ahead and go in and take a look at the screen resolution settings and there's an option to make text and other items larger or smaller and if
I right now it's at the largest if I shrink it all the way to the smallest you'll see everything gets really really tiny so here's YouTube with tiny tiny text
Windows on this device is that you either have large items that they don't have a lot of screen space because it's like having a virtual 1024 by 768 pixel display or you shrink things but some applications
Windows settings are and they give you tiny buttons no matter what another thing to keep in mind is that there's two operating systems on just 32 gigs of internal storage
and so that means that if you look at the windows free space here with not that many applications installed I've got less than 10 gigabytes of free space and it only thinks that the the hard drive or the the solid-state drive is 17 and a half gigabytes if you switch over to Android it only has 32 gigabytes of free space
SD card slot so you can install removable storage and that's next to the SIM card slot which you can use for a 3G card volume and power buttons over here
and that's about it
yeah it sounds ok
in terms of sort of how useful it is this device sells for about $200 and I think that's a pretty great price for a tablet that does all this can do if it were an Android tablet or a Windows tablet
the fact that it's both is is a nice bonus if you can live with the limitations the fact that it doesn't have a lot of storage in fact that windows on high resolution screens can be a little bit iffy occasionally
when you're using in desktop mode the biggest problem really is that you need to reboot in order to switch so say you were doing some work editing documents or images or other things using Windows and you wanted to switch over to an Android app and play a game
so it's kind of like having two separate tablets for the price of one which is nice but it's not exactly the same thing as just having a Windows tablet that can run Android apps or in the hand roid tablet that can run Windows apps so it really is two different operating systems gives you two different experiences but with shared hardware so it's cheaper than buying two different tablets so I think it's it's an interesting device
it's decent performance
so that's why
another weird thing
I can go in
so that's another another thing to keep in mind so it's a little bit quirky in a couple of ways but overall it's a it's an interesting device and it shorted shows
I'm not sure
I'd recommend dual OS because there are sort of those weird quirks but if you want to tablets in the price of one then I think the cube i6 error
it'll start to reboot
what's up guys
I've got my hands
and lots more
Mac's Android tablet so
let's begin with a very quick unboxing so inside the box you will find a user manual a USB power brick a micro USB charging cable and last but not least the tablet itself so here it is people the voil I ate max
it's the max model
Pro and the i8
so on the front we have a 10.1 inch full HD IPS display with a screen resolution of 1920 by 1200 furthermore this is the world's first tablet with the Helio X 20 CPU so that is a deck of core which is a 10 core CPU combined with the manly t-80 graphics
viewing angles look great and the colors look at nice and sharp the Full HD screen is actually quite bright and a pleasure to use now on the right side we have a volume rocker and a power button and on the top of the tablet micro USB charging port and a headphone jack
and if we keep going there's nothing on this side and at the bottom you have two indents which is for the keyboard dock sold separately so this tablet has dual SIM card slots hidden behind the camera section
so this part can be removed as simply taking off this section it will give you access to a micro SD card slot which supports a maximum of 128 gigabytes
you also have dual
4G SIM card slot
Wi-Fi AC but also the option to pop a SIM card in and use your data while you're on the move so a very useful feature indeed so and this top part is quite easy to take off
it's not a struggle at all you've got an indent there you can simply pull it off from one side and it comes off so it's secure but easy to take off at the same time so now you have a 180 degree kickstand here
it's made of metal
and it's a feels very solid quite a useful kickstand if you're into online movie streaming and it will help you achieve any angle you like up to 180 degrees
so let's see how this tablet handles full HD streaming and gaming so you can stream a maximum of 1080p on YouTube so you have the full version of the Google Play Store so you can technically download any app or game you like and it should run very smooth on this tablet so coming to the camera on the back we have a 12 megapixel shooter and here are some samples for you guys to check out
Valle I ate
you can achieve around 7 hours battery life on this device playing games and watching movies with brightness set to medium now the 12 megapixel camera was just average and
I would have loved to see this tablet with USBC fast charging as this device takes around 3 hours to fully charge bottom line for around $200 this is a decent tablet offering lots of power performance and portability with a very nice full HD screen now
I found this very enjoyable especially for gaming movies Netflix and even Kodi builds runs super smooth on this and with that being said I will leave the links in the description so you guys can check this product out
if you have a slight sense of deja vu when I say that that will be because I have already reviewed this tablet once but if you recall I had some calibration issues with it so Galan said that they would send me another one because they thought that it was damaged in transit because the original one came from Amazon and this one was sent directly from them and they said they tested it personally themselves
so thank you to
which is really interesting
because it's not like any others that i've used before it's designed to be compact and space-saving for those who have limited space to work in and it can also be used as a mousepad so if you want to keep it on your desk when you're not using it you can put your mouse on it instead
it currently retails at twenty six ninety-nine on amazon UK so it's definitely an appealing price for those who want to get into digital art without too much of an upfront financial commitment
the tablet comes in a cardboard box with a plastic tray inside in that you get the tablet itself which as you can see is slightly bendy then you also get a CD for driver installation which you don't actually need if you don't have a CD drive you can install from the website you also get a brief instruction leaflet you get the spare nibs for the pen and the tool to replace the nib so you get four spare nibs which is good then you get the USB cable which is just a standard USB two micro USB connection and then finally you get the pen so the pen uses a double-a battery
so that when it's off it's not using battery and it also has two buttons on the side which you can program to pretty much any shortcut you like setting up
I just connected it to the USB and then went on to the Galman website to download the Viper's so like I said you don't actually need the CD for installation if you don't have a drive my laptop's CD drive doesn't work so I just went on to gallon one and then you enter your model number and your operating system and you can just download the drivers from there from then
if you have other tablets installed on your computer you may need to uninstall those first because the drivers might clash within the Galman software there is a utility for testing out your pressure sensitivity but interestingly I found that it didn't quite keep up with the way I tend to test my tablets so I tend through a lot of quick strokes just to see how it performs and it was
Sai which is my standard drawing software the pressure sensitivity was fine so I think it's just actually that software itself for testing it but isn't quite up to scratch as you can see from my following tests in paint tool
worked as it should
I use screen tablets generally so I am very out of practice with non screen tablets so I just needed to do some practice lines to get used to using one of these again and also because I wasn't used to the soft surface of this tablet so like I said this tablet obviously is marketed on the fact that it's flexible so it has a softer surface than standard tablets
Galman did advise me not to bend the tablet completely over so you can't roll it up or anything because they said that in my actually break it but the fact that it's got a flexible surface is definitely different to other tablets that I've used and the fact that it can be used as a mousepad as well so if you have really really limited space it does utilize all of that space be aware that the USB cable does add another centimeter or so on top of the tablet
it's not shown in the picture on the front but the cable does come out at the top of the tablet so if you have a computer behind it that will just reduce your space a tiny bit more and
so my laptop and my tablet are very close to each other and so add that little bit of extra dimension to the tablet so just be aware of that but I mean standard tablets have the USB cable coming out the top
sorry is very compact
but the pressure sensitivity was accurate it has 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity which is actually equal to my Wacom Cintiq and to most entry level drawing tablets so that's pretty impressive for the price bracket and I felt like I utilized all of those levels of pressure sensitivity while I was working the surface of this tablet gives you a little bit of Bounce while you work and combined with the fact that the pen has a much longer than a bit than most of the other tablet pens
I've tried it does feel slightly different to most other tablets that I've used but it didn't take too long to get used to the tablet has no Express keys so for anyone who's unfamiliar express
I have shortcuts for undo/redo turning the pen from a pin to in a razor and back again and so on but on this tablet I didn't really miss them because I had my laptop right there as you can see from the webcam footage
I don't think necessarily the Express keys are something that are missing on a tablet like this because it's so small you would have to extend the tablet by quite a lot to fit them in but it does have the Express keys on the pen which is really nice and I programmed those to change the brush size which is the same setting
that's just how
I find it the easiest to use so you can set those buttons to a lot of different shortcuts or any keystroke which is what I did with brush size
so that's really handy
it's just something that
which means you can take the pen away from the tablet by 10 millimeters before it stops recognizing where it is and I found this to be pretty accurate to the description
I did test it out a few times moving the pen away seeing how it responded and the 10 millimeters is a pretty accurate representation there like I said I use paint tool
Sai for this which is my standard drawing software and I didn't have any software clashes or anything a couple of times when I was drawing dots such as when I was doing freckles on the characters face the line wouldn't actually come out so I had to go back and press a little bit harder so I think that was because of the surface of the tablet is softer
so sometimes if you're drawing short lines or dots you have to just press a little bit harder but apart from that when drawing longer strokes the pressure sensitivity didn't seem to have any issues
I was gonna draw her with sideburns and then they just didn't look right so I need to work out how to draw sideburns so I just gave her a little bit of stubble for now
she's a ranger
there was no skipping
it's just different so I would definitely recommend especially for that price point because at the moment it's much cheaper than it has been when I first reviewed this tablet it was going for about 45 pounds
I had reviewed the Archos 70 which is a 7 inch capacitive Arcos Android tablet also running 2.1 much like this 101 out of the box key differences between the two devices are price point and size otherwise tech specs are pretty much identical so let me just run down exactly what the differences are besides being a 10.1 inch thousand 24 by 600 screen as opposed to the Archos 70 s 800 by 480 screen
so that's a little bit of an advantage but this is a bigger device so it should have at least one additional perk beyond a little more real estate for the screen also
viewing angles on
B G and n Wi-Fi ability Bluetooth of course 2.1 so you can tether or connect other Bluetooth devices and of course the key hope here is to get that 2.2 on here which again Arco still hasn't delivered on but hopefully we'll see you soon because that really should unlock the potential of this device
I have to say I have noticed that the Wi-Fi even though they have the same internal specs has been responding a little bit better on getting a stronger signal out of this
I think that probably has more to do with the fact that the arrogant and the design internally probably is playing a larger factor in that than the actual internal since they are identical screen also more responsive a finding pinch-to-zoom to be the best
no flash support here
I'm just really impressed
I can't stress enough if you're looking for a mobile device that can pack masters or your movies and pictures and you know whatever content you may have then you want to go with the 250 gig model which hopefully will be surfacing soon again
I'm pretty impressed again
it's pretty good
I have not had time to install or customize this tablet as I did just receive it today last thing I want to show you guys of course as I mentioned is the build
HDMI your microUSB your micro SD card slot underneath it the USB host as I mentioned before and then your three-and-a-half millimeter headphone jack really liking or I should say preferring the power and volume rocker on this design then the seven B even though again the cemani does have a much more solid feel in the hand but that's because simply more plastics had to be employed on this build since this is a much bigger tablet on the back as you can see we've got the the two stereo speakers kickstand
so that's pretty cool
close up that kickstand
any questions or comments
what's up guys
what's up guys
that's right
it's a graphics tablet
it's one of the newer ones that I've had my way around with it and played with it and I find it incredibly annoying and I hope you guys will too so basically
is this smaller one
Wacom for some reason
just go
whoa calm
there's a tablet
everybody it's a nice tablet even though for smaller size we've actually enjoyed it and it it really doesn't faze me that much for being so small so there's the pin that's attached to it as two buttons and an eraser and a pointer tip there so that is the complete package right there as everything that comes with just the tablet and the pin it comes with a couple spare parts though so if you damage the tip
it has the called buttons which is nice which you can program those to OS anything you want so if you work more in Photoshop you can work those buttons to work in Photoshop to do specific tasks so they're just physical push buttons
that's the pin itself
and it's configurable to that sense but if let's say you want to erase something well if you're working in Photoshop or anything you turn it around and use the flat end and it actually recognizes it as an eraser
you can see that it's glowing white right now and once you move your pin closer it turns to like an ambarish color to let you know that it's within range and then that color actually brightens up when it is activated on the touchpad so it gives you kind of a visual signal
that's just there kind of like for the start getting to really know where your pin is but I actually ignored it after I got really used to it and it has that little tag thing that holds the pin
so let's head over now into the software section of this so it has a nice software bundle and you see me is like draw to enter and it has multiple settings
so you can see you can customize what your pin does if it compete in a touch mode a mouse type mode is basically we call the touch mode or the pin mode which basically means that the pin travels it around so the screen area
so you can really utilize the space you can also turn the tablet left-handed or right-handed so if you're left-handed person you can draw left right hand to draw out the right
it's a right
InTouch input which can help you navigate so basically it will turn into a Magic Trackpad plus more features if you don't want to just get a Magic Trackpad and you want something that can do a little bit extra
I was surprised with it kind of integrate with Evernote which you see there and it just for drawing and you can even play games with it as well as even tweet so right now
we're gonna look at just the regular sketching which they call it a doodler so you can doodle away like notes or quick sketches or sketch ups or whatever you want to do so right now
I'm just right now
save as a file do anything with it so if you wanted to save it for later comes with a notebook app as well as well as a couple kind of playing around application such as this
Oh anyways moving on there's also a bulge feature so it can pop it out and you know just play around so this is really kind of a to get you to learn how to use the tablet and also has app in there and I'm just drawn incendiary things and I probably should stop now because it's really really annoying moving on it agrees with
Evernote like I said and there's even more applications in an online store that's accessible through the bamboo app and it has tons of applications that are made specifically for the touchpad such as games
that's right
you're not left out
I shut it down there just by throwing in my eraser tool so basically that's it it it just it's amazing and I really like it and is fun to be able to play with and again as I talking about with software it comes with software CD for you to be able to learn how to use it
Adobe Photoshop Elements
that's that's a how about a hundred dollar program that comes with it as well as Nick color FX pro as well which comes free with it as well as some other free kind of preview applications
it's called the
I believe from Amazon so not too expensive and it will get you going on the track for you know for those graphic designers or anybody who wants to play around with the touch pad so that does it for me

I got from
I'm into that and before start I wanted to say I'm really really really really sorry for for taking so long to make that video the lady that was talking to me by email was so freaking nice and patient to me
are people like that so a little point for her so the first part is going to be an unboxing then a spit thing and the last part my thoughts about the toilet
so the tablet comes in a cute box with a crocodile in it so it arrived safety to me so another bonus so another bonus point for not letting it dry
but that's good
it's way better
I'm not like that
also you want some changes with my advice or something like that because I really would like to make videos with my voice maybe in the future with my face
thank you for watching
hi I'm Ryan and I'm checking out the dragon touch x10 - one of the first things I noticed about this tablet is large 10 inch display it is IPS
Netflix and YouTube videos
Need for Speed
however load times can be long the Geekbench multi-core score came in at 12:45 the tablet also comes with 16 gigabytes of storage with about 12 gigabytes available for storing apps
don't sound that great
thanks for watching
la told in the previous video that I will be doing review after using a graph that the grand ax view 3 and I want to share with you guys one feature which I found on this tablet which is how to record a screen err once you swipe down the top screen you will find an option in here which is called the record screen just press it and one bar will appear on top which will have a record circle
I do here
have a good day
what's up guys
we are reviewing you
GM 708 or is it - you are not really sure but um I'm just gonna call it - ug for now so it's a cheap but a quality alternative for the Wacom tablets just a quick disclaimer
get the tablet itself
it provides eight nice
there's also a blue light that flashes every time the pen touches the tablet as you can see just right there now this can be in an annoyance for some people but for me
Amazon as well
the cable is 1.2 meters long which is good if you have the computer at a distance like me but if you don't you can just wrap it up and just stick it in there
feel to it
I guess that's it
I don't like about this tablet is its extremely delicate in the first week of using it I got a lot of scratches on it and I don't even press the hard on the pen so I would recommend if you buy a screen protector for it or just place a piece of plastic on top like I do so if I can just kind of show I'm not sure if will appear on camera or not if you can see those scratches and I've only been that
I don't like you because sometimes it gets in my way my drone especially when I pick up the pain wrong so if I pick up the pen like this and I might press accidentally on it just like that and it's very very annoying so you're gonna always have to hold a tablet just depend just like this cuz you don't want the pen getting away
that's just me
and if you open the pen holder there was actually extra pen nibs and a neighbor mover as well so some of the nibs got loose right there so here are the nibs we have one two three
we've eight nibs
it's very easy
you get your pen
here's the nib
and you just pretty much see the hole right there you put it in and you just grab it and you pull it out simple if you want to put a new one back and you just put that in there oops get rid of the neighbor
I can't really say how long the nibs will last you because it depends on your use and how much you use it during the week and for how long a user
ask me actually how
I'm hovering
I can see a cursor on my screen so literally indicates where I'm about to draw so I'm just hovering right there and then when I press the block comes on but when I'm hovering you can just see the cursor and this helps you know where you're drawing I so it's not that hard
the thing about this tablet is it has no impact on drawn so it works very very smoothly it also has a 2080 sensitivity so the pen pressure works very very well so of course you don't want to be pressing too hard or you can get really deep scratches which
but if you go lightly you can see that pen works just like a normal pencil like strokes and then when you just the more you press the darker the lines get this tablet works for both Mac and PC although Windows is more customizable so I'd really recommend if you have Windows oh so I'm on my PC here and if I go right here and click on the software click yes and here is the software for the new gm7 away so I'm gonna go through all these sections really quickly so if we go to Express keys right here you pretty much have the Express keys and you can change them so by clicking on it you can go in do math
there's different math functions multimedia internet you can just have a look at that by yourself it's very very self-explanatory and I click OK but I already have them as default so it works for me like that I like it the way it is if we go into scope right here so this is pretty much the pen Airy depend area the area you want to pen to work on right here but obviously you most likely you'll want the full area so just click for air here you can do whatever reserve edges screen ratio and all that
now here's the important part to work an area orientation so if you're left-handed you want to make sure that you click on the left right here now if you're right-handed it's gonna be on default on the right side anyways so you want to make sure you're on the left because everything's gonna be upside down if you switched tablet and you don't switch the orientation in the software if we go to talk
he sells hot cells
switch it to light because it pretty much changes how you press on the tablet so the more you press on the tablet the darker it's gonna get but I would definitely keep that on light if we go into the button right here
okay and yeah start working for some reason so now if we go to the model settings now if you three monitors like me you might have a few problems with it
you want here sort of mark the second monitor the first monitor that you want it to work on that you can click portion of monitor and you can just put in some whatever like width and height
Wacom tablets have that
and that's the darkest it goes so let me increase the brush size here and then maybe there's a better demonstration so the lightest it can go literally just scrape it off the top and I'm gonna go a bit darker in a bit darker and a bit darker and and the darkest just like that so you can see the pressure sensitivity
I think it's a really nice nice software just drop a comment down below and I'll teach you how to use it but that's pretty much it for the you gm7 away
I finally sold out
pretty cool huh
alright so here
look at that
it's a display tablet
warm tip whoa
Oh warm tip
I think I'm gonna pause and put it together but you know all right so I lost a lot of what I said about this in review uh but overall it's very good you know what don't be shy
don't be shy
there's a peanut butter
stop up [ __
] who are you
oh no go ahead
Thanks that's enough
oh yeah shut up
no he's not
listen they're recording
I really hate ketchup
I surprisingly got this from a thrift store for two dollars and I can pass up a deal and the funny thing is it actually works so obviously this is the adult screen and you got the kids profile
no surprise my password
this is nothing major
obviously and then just go to profiles and you go to the kids site simply where you and all kinds of games just a little bit soldier so as I said so your daughter management and this is where you you can choose
computer testing hope
what a headphone jack
HDMI and I will see the micro USB port that you used to charge it on the top you have the power button and the volume up and volume down button
there is a micro
SD card slot
I said before
I am computer tech
USB as a very nice indicator showing it that it works the screen real estate can either be used left-handed or right-handed I prefer my using it right-handed there's ways the USB cord lies now the screen real real estate you my ass as you can see this represent the edge of your computer screen
I use this tablet more than my mouse even though I use this more for graphics wise but I'm more leaning it on using as a mouse now be showing you a hands-on demo using Autodesk SketchBook Pro 2011 with this tablet
I found it
you could do
prejudice pressure sensitive
I found this pet
I said before it is a lot easier to draw with this tablet instead of using a pen and mouse with this - programmable key keys as you can see this is right-click for this program and left-click I don't think will work with this program but left
(upbeat music)
The Wacom Cintiq 16 also supports many of the legacy pens, such as the Wacom Art Pen, which can sense pen rotation. Additional nib types are also supported. The Cintiq 16 features a 15.6 inch screen with an HD resolution of 1920x1080 pixels.
A higher screen resolution makes fine lines, stippling and hatching appear clearer and sharper, especially when zoomed out, but, aside from that, there's not much of an advantage to having a higher screen resolution. The Cintiq 16's screen was more than clear enough for me to see much of the paper grain texture in my pencil drawing.
You definitely won't want to be drawing on a glossy screen because it doesn't provide resistance to your pen, it sticks to your hand, and it reflects everything around you.
The Cintiq 16 screen is matte, not gloss, so I was able to clearly see what I was drawing, even while surrounded by the big lights I use for recording.
Moving to the exterior of the Cintiq 16, there are built in folding legs on the back of the display that will allow the Cintiq to angle from almost flat to a 19 degree incline.
Assembly is easy.
The cable combines HDMI, USB and power into a three-in-one cable, which attaches securely to the back of the Cintiq 16 and does not encumber the display as much as three separate cables would.
Moving to the front of the Cintiq 16, you'll notice that there are not any external Express Keys like the ones found on some of the older generation Cintiqs. Instead, the optional Wacom Express Key
One downside to using the remote is that the remote does not stick to the Cintiq 16 like it does on the larger models, nor is there any additional bezel to dock the remote even if it were magnetic.
There is an LED illuminated power button at the top right of the Cintiq 16. It's inset into the surface of the bezel, so that it's flush and does not protrude.
I know not
Wacom's Pro Pen
The transitions in pen
I've tried.
So those are just a few of the differences in quality you might expect from the Cintiq 16 compared to the cheap alternatives, but how does the Cintiq 16 compare to the more expensive options
Wacom has to offer?
Legacy Wacom pens are also supported, which can add functionality like rotation. There are fans on top of the Cintiq 16, but I haven't noticed any fan noise, even while drawing with the screen brightness up all the way. This could be an advantage because some of the more expensive Cintiqs have internal fans that create noise.
It's also very stable when pushing the tablet side to side. It does wiggle a bit on the horizontal rotational axis, but overall it works really well to keep your tablet in place.
Coming from a larger Cintiq, I will admit that I did miss having touch on occasion, and the screen also feels a little bit small, especially if the application UI takes up a lot of your screen.
there that are cheaper

(light upbeat music)
hi there
it's a brand new hybrid tablet that I think has the potential to compete very well against the Microsoft Surface pro 3 the Zed 20 T is a hybrid device
meaning that it comes with a keyboard this one here and it just simply clips together to become more of a laptop style device the thing about a hybrid device like that the Sheba's ed 20 T is that the keyboard is really just an accessory
you can see that
there's a whole host of ports on the keyboard and on the tablet itself for example we've got two USB ports there and an Internet port built into the keyboard base
you'll see that we have some real legacy stuff here we've got the VGA port and the HDMI port there a mini HDMI on the device itself as well as a mini USB
so this means that
Intel hardware namely the Intel Core M series processors now the Intel Core M is equally as powerful as the last generation has well processors but there's two big bonuses about having a Broadwell chip in this device
there's no fan vents
so this is actually a fanless design so this is something that a lot of people have really been excited about and waiting for for many years to see a high powered tablet like this without a fans now
the benefit of the new hardware is the fact that it's so much lighter now if I could take my surface pro 3 here and put them side-by-side I wish you could actually feel that but the the said 20 T is actually around about a hundred grams lighter in this form than it is in the surface pro 3 now I think the surface pro 3 is well and truly light enough to be a fantastic device for what it is but having that 100 grams less on this device is just amazing on top of that unlike the surface pro 3 the Zed 20 T from Toshiba will come with a 4G LTE optional inbuilt broadband modems so that means effectively
you could put your SIM card from your local carrier into this device and get on the internet without having to muck around with hotspots on your mobile phone what I expect to see in terms of battery life on the Z 20 T
I find with my surface pro 3 that I can be away from the office all day and get through the day without having to plug in with this device having the keyboard with the battery inbuilt alongside you you'll easily be able to get through one if not two days of work without having to bother plugging into the wall
we also have a 1920 by 1080 high-definition screen the sample unit that I have here doesn't actually have the digit we're built-in but all of the models in Australia will ship with the Wacom active digitizer system
they're not really fantastic to work with on a long-term basis so you'll probably want to use something like maybe one of the Toshiba pens or this motion pen that I have here
so we'll have the ability to do our handwritten note taking in OneNote and to do our document markup in office and those sorts of things with the pen as well as the handwriting recognition system that's in Windows 8
VGA port on the side being able to use the base keyboard as a docking station effectively with its USB ports HDMI and VGA as well as Ethernet means that companies don't have to go and shell out extra for a docking station just to get up and running the lower resolution screen
that's going to be really important as well and I think the last reason that the z20 is going to be a massive hit is because it has 4G inbuilt and that is a feature that customers particularly in Australia are looking for in a mobile device like this
but the original was made in november when i was in an art rut and unfortunately i forgot to start recording until after i finished the sketches for the redraw but anyway xp pen has sent me their brand new artist 22 second generation which i'm going to abbreviating as 2g for this review because it's kind of a mouthful these are all strictly my opinions
it is very much
a no-frills tablet doesn't have any express keys or dials or anything like that and this isn't really a positive or a negative because it's just a design consideration because some people like myself don't actually use those express keys in the dials and stuff because we just use our keyboards
and to get it off i would recommend using a little bit of oil or something because man the adhesive really likes to stick on there for the tablet itself
this trend its color
it could be that
i have one usb-c slot on my pc so i'm finally able to take advantage of it and it just saved me a usb slot on the back which i'm very limited on other than that plugging it in is pretty simple
you have your power
see if it's still registering that the screen is on when you power it off some models turn off the entire tablet which disconnects the monitor and can lead to you to having to detect the monitor when you turn it back on others only turn off the screen but keep on rendering it which winds up being a drain on your video card
update even if there's just a small little button that says identify but for now you'll need to exit out and restart the drivers for them to notice the tablet
screen mapping and then the next tab is for the easy to set up pressure curve for the pen as well as what keys you want to map the pen buttons to the artist 22 2g is brand new and is 470 in their store
which actually isn't that expensive for this size of tablet the cost probably being brought down by the lack of bells and whistles for someone like me the simplicity is actually a bonus
it also lacks express keys so if that's something that you use regularly you may want to wait for a model that has them or go with a different model third
you have to restart the driver every time you turn it back on which is not a really a big deal but it is something to be aware of but aside from those issues if those are not big deals then this is an excellent model and is an incredible value by my book
22 is no exception
art ruts are weird
but if you ever find yourself in one just remind yourself that it will pass just because you're struggling to draw today doesn't mean that you won't be better tomorrow or next week
let's unbox this baby
what is this
oh a bag
i can't read
ah just kidding
itself isn't battery powered
it doesn't need to be charged so that's already a plus it's got two little buttons on it for color picking and erasing which can also be changed by the way it doesn't have an eraser at the end though so if you're used to that like i am
i am sorry included a lot of extra pen nibs as well which is really cool of them they also provided a tool to remove the nibs which is even better
the keyboard shortcut buttons
there are so many
so if you'd like to buy one or check it out the links will be there so go ahead and check that out and thank you guys so much and just finish off the speedpaint have a good day
iCard somewhere over here to watch that video I have gone through basically the basic stuff like build quality and other things that you need to know about this one as well as unboxing so okay
there is also a switch to actually turn off and on the gesture pad like if you are thinking that it's coming in between while you are drawing you can literally turn it off connecting to PC or laptop is very easy remember
just go to week
two tablet website
you can find the link in the description below so just download the driver from website which is only one step thing actually like you don't have to find out the model and do all that thing
it's not complicated
click on the download file whether you are using Mac or Windows and once you download and install just plug in the provided USB cable which is USB C which is again nice thing to PC or your laptop and open the software as usual instantly and automatically it recognizes
and with this the cursor movement becomes a little bit fast as compared to the usual pen movement so it becomes faster and is a joy to use it like a mouse
so how's the pen
because it's often hard to find the button whenever you want to perform quick swipe or quick actions like it's not so much prominent that you'll quickly find the buttons actually so it'll be like searching on which side the button is located
it's pretty seamless with the pen that I can say the tips or the nibs can be replaced and is provided inside the box along with the tip remover as well now coming to the important aspect on why you should actually buy this tablet and how this actually performs now
now the reading height is like a 10 millimeter from the surface of the tablet to the pen tip as you can see how precise and smooth it is but occasionally the pen wouldn't react quickly as I draw something sometimes I felt that there is slight delay and that time side it was working just fine so there is sensitivity control and adjusting it to optimal level
I feel now
you know to just have some safety for the tips but there is this beautiful looking soft case nonetheless for pen so guys if you are in the market looking for a tablet I think with the functions and features this tablet has to offer
so don't forget to click on that subscribe button for more videos like and share it with your friends and yeah alright guys see you all in another one till then take care everyone
it's lost an ounce or two weight which is a good thing you still have that distinctive little grab handle over here the Nook button in the middle that that brings you to all things command central
you can go to home library shop search apps web and settings right here and on the side we have our hardware volume controls something that the Amazon Kindle Fire lacks 3.5
millimeter headphone jack
up here
we've got a micro
SD card slot
back here nice
what's inside here
CPU that's much much
faster than the 800 megahertz single core cpu that was in the Nook Color the collar became the poor man's tablet because for 249 it was a pretty nice tablet for the money a lot cheaper than anything else on the market but it was really a little sluggish a lot of folks rooted it
it has a gig of ram whereas the old one had 512 magazine ram and we have 16 gigs of internal storage which is a big marketing point for Barnes & Noble versus the Kindle Fire
here's a gotcha
Android 2.3 Gingerbread just like the Kindle Fire and that's essentially the phone version of the Android operating system not the new honeycomb version but the reason I do that is because it's a lot easier to customize 2.3
we've got this retains a bit more of the look and feel of Android than the Kindle Fire doesn't it's really still highly customized but at least you do have a desktop here you can see the little dots up there to tell you you can switch between your desktops and you can put books up here
terms of interface
things are pretty much
stay the same
if you want to go home just press that and choose home or you can quickly switch into shop or your apps or a web browser of course settings as well and we've got shortcuts here to the books
got the book that
they're very well done and this really hasn't changed again from the Nook Color and and very fast very rich and then you can see it will sink to further this red page and you can use this in landscape mode if you want to
so here's an article right here and we can get an overview of each page too so if you want to go quickly through the pages you can do that
you can bring your your Nick tablet in there and you can read for free while you're in store and get free Wi-Fi and get assistance from those staff members
I have pre-loaded here and it also shows me stuff that's basically my archive anything that have purchased or any samples that I've requested at some point from being animal shall appear on anything that isn't downloaded says download
we're jelly topping
turn speeds obviously fine
you can research you can share and of course the support snook friends and duck lending and you can change your fonts and this is pretty good selection of fonts here serif and sans-serif fonts and also similar to earth and Kindle Fire no offers you got more options with colors backgrounds that kind of thing and many different point sizes for text trouble different line spacing right here and margin settings and you can just go the publisher defaults
this is an
that's used by
now when you're in a bucket so you want to look up something present hold on it and you can make notes you can highlight and you can look it up and you can search as well while you're on
BNN or you're on side loaded books you can read in landscape mode if you like but I'm not sure why you would want to but you can do it
I've downloaded ever know
Hulu Plus and Netflix
so those things like
C's make the Twitter client Pandora a media player that sees media files at either side loaded just perfectly well and if you wanted checkout more apps you go right here and is done by category now
they have interactive books
read to myself
Apple car is read
engines are read
see with kid books you can read a record so say you want to narrate a book for yourself or your child really a cool feature a chooser and just hit the record button and you start talking when you're done you hit done unless we have my stuff which is anything that you put in the my files folder
we're gonna look at a book you know some library still do lend in PDF format which isn't always a glorious thing and I can open this with Quickoffice as my options are with the BNN reader
we're going to use to be an in reader for this one and there you have it and you can pinch and zoom but you know text is a little bit small and PDF is still not ideal for 7-inch despise even on LCD but you can swap it into landscape mode which is generally more readable though perhaps inviting a lot of scrolling but yes it can do it
I have a sign
that's heavily Illustrated
PDF view here
if you walk away
so how about Netflix
Plus as well
we're gonna check out
wow that's really good
this is a very nice screen along that good speaker and it's streaming over Wi-Fi 802 live in and this does not have 3G if you do have a phone with a mobile hotspot feature of course you can use that
looks like
it's got a whole bunch of suggested stuff here of course you do need to have a Netflix account to use this and all of these are side-scrolling so you can look at an infinite number of films gone sideways
plays in the background
let's check that out
those full screen play as well so nice also handy for access to more simple things like the Wikipedia not well and you've got access to pretty much all you can favorite right here you've got access to all of the the Android type settings right here which runs in portrait mode this screen
is your bookmark screen
and then of course we've got to compare it to the Kindle Fire here on this side Kindle Fires a little bit more compact they both have 7 inch displays
this is fourteen point
they're both rather nice display and then from the back the Kindle has that kind of soft touch finish and this has a slightly rubbery plastic back and in your side view
eighteenth those popping up in a couple of stories early and it's two forty-nine fifty dollars more than the Kindle Fire $50 less than the HTC Flyer which is just a straight Android OS 2.3 Gingerbread tablet though supposedly at some point that one's gonna get honeycomb so when you get for your fifty dollars versus the fire you get more internal storage though
it's not only user accessible something to keep in mind you get that microSD expansion slot you'll also get hardware volume controls on this guy and for those of you who prefer epub format or the Barnes & Noble store
they both can display
Wow kids that's over
a thousand four times
yeah safety - number four anti glare glass eye perception and gives the screen a paver like feel main feature number five upgraded three and one cable stronger and more stable less likely to fumble in lesser mess
yeah where's my name
Jenny a minute mister
look there the nibs
the way on tablet comes with everything you see here it even comes with international plugs so you can do art wherever you are if you want a hooli own tablet for yourself you can use the Amazon link in description down below
I'm a cartoon
oh gosh um
go downtown hello
Tara Chan here if you want to get a human tablet for yourself you can use the Amazon link down in the description thank you for Hugh Young for supporting this video
hello fellow noobster
8.1 has until bay trail-t 32 gigabyte storage both front and rear facing cameras got bluetooth 4.0 eyeless in HDMI two gigabytes around the quad core processor got three year off the office
oh and on
we go and so
that's like that
millimeter jack
O USB 3.0 so don't try and stick one of those in and break it then we got ourselves a micro USB charger port and you can use this to charge of things by using this USB but it doesn't give out very much what AM pitch or wattage or something and so it's not really recommend over here
and we have a nice logo in the back winbook and there's two speakers on the bottom on the left and right if you can see that barely those holes and it says intel and its product stuff and it has a front facing camera right there if you can see that
all right charger port which this was in my closet not closing my thing and it's pretty faster charging with this one but if I were you I'd recommend and getting a faster one if you want to charge a faster I mean that's what you want
I've opened this before
just take that out and you stick this in make sure you stick it on the right side so very simple you can use it like that like this or you can even use it like you can use in many different ways
they hold for the camera the front-facing camera if it's closed obviously and this says winbook on it too so it's an original manufacturer case for it and it has holes for the actual speakers as well and let's get into this
and yeah okay
calendar mailstore
Google Chrome which I liked which is just basically the actual application which I look to use which I think are deleted all in one thing after about a month about after a month this key right here well just go out so it won't work anymore but you can still press it down here on this windows logo and it still works perfectly fine
the camera resolution
8 ok so
um these cameras
I wouldn't cuz cuz you need like a keyboard for it which you can usually buy one off ebay like a bluetooth keyboard or a plug-in keyboard even and this has lots of apps already pre-installed and stuff and what sucks about it it doesn't need to pre installed so I has skype already pre-installed which is nice
really fast it has
and there's a battery saver mode which if you were to have a hundred percent and you put on a battery saver mode you could probably have it like watching movies or something or YouTube with Internet
I'm sorry
two episodes oh yeah
add some coconut milk
what about you
HD 8
the first one actually went on the right way they have a pretty good instruction video on what to do and how to lay it in the right place the first time so we got an extra one if it ever if it ever breaks but I can tell you in the amount of time that we've had it
she has thrown it around and stepped on it used it as a stool so getting into the actual workings of its program and it only took about 15 minutes and Amazon already knew all the account information it needed to update the software in it
I suggest that as a parent you go through and load just the apps you want them to play on there and that'll make it a lot easier because they do take a little while to download
the cheapest place
nothing you don't want them to see they can't go out on the internet and find things you don't want them to see it still can be used as a adult account
you can monitor how long they use it every day and you can set boundaries when it's bedtime you can have it turn off so there's a lot of good sides to it charging doesn't take too long
subscribe for future reviews
GT 191 tablets
they haven't paid me
widescreen panel a 16 by 9 aspect ratio 3000 to 1 contrast ratio so it vividly displays sixteen point seven million colors and I was most impressed by the 8,192 levels of pen pressure sensitivity
I was actually really impressed with the box itself because they've packed everything in between two pieces of MDF so it's all solidly held together in terms of what's in the box
it starts off with a thank you notes which is really lovely and then going through the contents they have the power cable the pen charging cable the USB cable power adapter the HDMI cable
the cleaning cloth the pen holder with eight replacement nibs which is amazing and they also give the screws to attach the stands to the tablet along with a screw driver
I'm super impressed
I should also mention
although it is very thick in terms of my review starting with the setup from plugging everything in to installing the drivers everything was quick and easy and it was only a few minutes before
I can imagine myself working on some much larger landscape paintings and that sounds super fun and I can't wait to continue using it and trying ideas like that it just it feels really exciting to have a much larger area to work on
I wanted to really test with some lines sweeping right across the page to see if it's had any anomalies but everything was smooth and it was working as I needed it to the screen is also bright and has great contrast and you can adjust all of these settings with the buttons along the bottom so I really like that because then you can adjust it to match your monitor in terms of brightness and the contrast and if you want a warmer or a cooler tone the pen itself is a bit of a different shape than I'm used to it's quite elongated and narrow but it feels great in your hand
they have had very basic stands with preset angles to choose from but in this case having that complete freedom of choice with the angle you want is really refreshing to see and I was so glad to see it
I usually have the buttons sets for erasing and undoing and also for the brush size and that sort of thing is is so helpful but in this case I managed just fine by changing the presets of the buttons on the pen to erase and undo along with having the keyboard next to me and using any shortcuts on that this really helped and everything works absolutely fine overall
it means a lot
I post these videos
then make sure to check out the links in the description box below to check out my Twitter Facebook and Instagram and once again thank you so much for the support and thank you so much for watching
and let's get it
I paid for it
click for me
the back is right
that's my screen here
oops okay what
I do now
I've zoomed in on this the primary screen here so hopefully you can see what I'm doing like I said disables the second screen or disables the fact that you can use the tablet axis the second screen and the included software programs that come with the tablet also disable the second screen or the
I should say the access to the second screen programs that come with it if you're using Windows 7 it advertises five programs on the back but only three of them are going to install and as far as I can tell none of them actually work like they're supposed to well
I click on it
here seems to be just basically an annotation type program you can switch from using a mouse to using an annotate so like let's say you're doing a presentation and you've broadcast your computer screen on to a projector or to a TV and you can you know like let's say
it also lets you pull up just a blank screen where you can just write directly on there if you feel like it and it also lets you save it if you want
yes and oh no
I say did anyway
but if you've clicked on that then you're stuck in the one screen again so there's a little weird sometimes but not too bad pin sign pin sign or excuse me basically
Word documents like you would sign it with a regular pin except unfortunately it doesn't work properly in Windows 7 so basically it just becomes another annotator you can just doodle on the screen except - so much bolder line
you can't bring up a blank screen to draw on and if you want you can just clear it out and you're back into mouse mode so that's basically just a another annotator because it doesn't work properly in seven pin mail basically lets you write an email like you're actually writing with a pin so it's kind of neat but basically what it does it just saves it as a JPEG picture and then you attach it to your email or you embed it in your email so that probably doesn't work although I have not tried to send an actual email you see when I exit out so Save Changes yes
let's save it and as you can see just as jpg and that little thing that pops when you're using Windows 7 if you just click it it automatically zooms the little thing over here so look shortcut there
I like using it
it even supports the different pressure controls on this tablet except it really doesn't like it when you use two screens and I'll show you in a minute here it was screwed up on me earlier and I'll see if it'll do it again
because you don't want to try and you know you want to use this whole tablet for your picture so you don't want to be drawing off the screen over there that that
that is actually way over here for some reason when you're running two screens and using like this it really screws things up now you can either just get used to it
and have your cursor way over there while you're drawing here but when you move it further to the right as you can see the cursor and the dot get farther and farther apart and if you move it to the left they get closer and closer together so it really screws up your drawing so what you have to do is if you want to use basically you just disable your second monitor or if you're not using a second monitor at all oh yeah and will also disable the tablet features on Windows 7 so when you open up that little hold long hold that I showed you with a little swirl thing yeah all that turns off for some reason
let's make this bigger
it supports the texture
as you can see
I haven't used Photoshop but it seems that pretty much everything that it does from what I've read I also use paint.net which is another free program but it does not support the pressure input
the good thing about this tablet is it basically replaces the mouse so anything any program that uses the mouse you can use with this tablet any image editing program
Emison such like that
I actually got rid of that to a person that had an older computer and I have to say this is just as good as the wacom maybe even a little better because I remember the Wacom chittering around or maybe my hand was just shaking that day or maybe it's the fact that this is so much bigger than that
it's just huge which is good for doing detailed drawing so you don't move half an inch on the tablet and it moves ten inches on the screen so yeah bigger is usually better with tablets and this is no exception
it works amazing
I don't know why you wouldn't but you can scale it down or move it around even where you can have a dead area off on the corners here if you want it
I don't know why let's move it back to Center and you can image drink it down so if you wanted to just use one corner of that you good
so that way exactly how you move it on here is just the same as if you were moving it directly on this screen or you could tell it to reserve
I said any program you want or a keyboard shortcut like control V or control a or something but yeah so overall I would say definitely worth the price I mean forty seven dollars and it shipped to your door
so that's my only real complaint about it other there except for maybe the fact that the pin base and the pin the pin doesn't go down and they're very deep so it doesn't seem like it's sitting in there very well but yeah you say you dig a little bit and it falls off but if you tickle it just a teeny bit
it'll stay in there there tool to actually remove the pin nibs is on the bottom here so that's kind of cool but yeah the pen is really the only complaint
okay sorry for kind of cutting into the end here but I just wanted to point out that the Quick Start Guide and the Emmanuel are actually hint kind of bad English and see the light right here
let's just unlock it
metal design
you'll see there a memory card slot and then if we go around onto this side just the nice beveled edges continue all the way around and then on the bottom we've got speakers and also we've got three and a half mil audio jack and a usbc charging port
i've been very impressed
it comes with the google apps pre-installed as you'll see here we've got the main suite of google apps pre-installed if i swipe across it's got the google play store as well so you can install your own apps and then if we swipe up you'll see the whole suite of apps that actually comes pre-installed on this so we've got the likes of google drive duo files photos youtube play store play movies and tv etc
if you want to pick up one of these for yourself check out the links down in the video description and i'll see you in another video very very soon
what's a pen tablet
you're gonna have your USB a two USBC connector cable the artist sole comes with two adapters USB C and micro USB to USB a so that you can connect it to an Android device
we'll cover that later
setup is simple to the left the USB a cable is going to go into your laptop or PC computer the single USBC connector is going to plug directly into the USB C port on the actual pen tablet device as mentioned m0 610
it is electromagnetic resonance
EMR for short
there's no eraser on the back and I found the pen to be really lightweight so I think this pen ibly popular with people who don't really like hard edges or hard angles you know on their actual pen device now just in the color of the LED lights is really easy to two Express keys below the dial are for manually changing the colors and adjusting the intensities of the colors and etc the last Express key is for cycling through the different lighting options
fast access
it gives you two open slots in case you want to add something besides zoom and etc the hotkeys you get seven of them this last one is for LEDs only and in addition we have left and right-handed mode
that are out there
adjust the pressure curve
the functionality works
this gives the added functionality of pressure sensitivity using the artists all tablet as long as it's sport in android version 6.0 and older which every Android device out there at this point should be we move on to Windows
and that's something we have to look at so these tests here are not really for client quality as much as they are speed of the pen to make sure what
I'm drawing some lines out here to make sure I'm not noticing any kind of drop in pressure you know from the beginning of the line which starts light and then the end of the line now
I did have to tweak the pressure curve in the driver as I'm shown here because I was getting a little bit of a drop out between the early part of the pressure in other a light pressure going into medium where it was a little heavy-handed but a quick adjustment and the driver fixed all that in fact as you can see after that's like tweak
I'm getting a really really nice even with pure black lines gradient and consistent pressure curve without in the artifacts on long slow strokes even these quick circles which I do to make sure we're not dropping out with alternate types of pen
strokes look really good
I did experience some issues with the driver not an installation necessarily but some issues with stability such as it wasn't starting up with the computer to which I just dragged out a shortcut to my desktop to remediate that and some crashing
I was really impressed even with all that going on the type of communication I experienced both with the support people who had no idea who I was and the person I was dealing with my contact directly at artists
I'm doing these reviews sort of route for these companies and you know given the badge of approval even if I've experienced some issues you know like I said with the driver sort of turning a negative into a positive so to speak that aside
what's critical is that
I'm getting nice crisp lines then and clip studio paint using the standard G pen performed it expected I had no problem getting two different line weights and effects and etc as I'm shown here on the screen
I get it just marketing but I'm saying as far as the personality goes to the company I like I mentioned the communication and that's really important but like in a review
the m20 610
Pro doesn't have some of the features of this more expensive competition but they don't advertise that I'm talking about things like wireless functionality and such they do feature the Android stuff and that's becoming pretty common among these pen tablets so some suggestions for improvement
I'm expecting those couple issues to be resolved when that driver goes live conversely the tilt functionality only being a Mac function I mean if you're a Mac user you don't really care right but some of the Windows users they really like that functionality and I can see that being a negative for some of those buyers when some of the other pad and tablets may feature that hopefully we get to see that turned on you know maybe in a future driver update so we'll be looking out for more future artists all devices and hopefully we get an opportunity to do more reviews on this channel on that note
you have the sony logo there in the top left-hand corner looking around the device up top you have a SIM card tray and SD card slot and the charging port up there as well on the side here you have the volume rocker and your power button there
and it's a 10.1
Z last year which
very smooth and very fast has a Snapdragon 801 quad-core processor three gigs of RAM in it and a 6000 milliamp battery which is going to give you up to 50 days of standby time but it runs very smooth this is the closest Android device
it has access to a huge library of music and movies and apps like the sony playstation app the walkman app the movies app that will give you access to a ton of movies that you can buy which they want you to do
it also has the built-in verizon apps which don't really slow it down in this version because it's so fast and I found very little leg throughout the whole device even here running a game real racing 3 3 it powers through it and runs it lag free very smooth overall very happy with the operating system and the speed of this tablet on the back of the z2
it's not the best device to do so but this overall does a pretty good job for a tablet if you need to take those shots last minute and that's all you have as you can see in the sample pictures here in the sample video
Xperia z2 tablet has a nice big bright 10.1 inch display 1080p display and has the Snapdragon 801 quad-core processor runs very smooth access to a ton of music and movies on it
Xperia z2 tablet
what we have here is a ten core 11.6 inch Android powered tablet and it's actually running Android 8.1 unfortunately Android 8.1 is pretty old as of 2020 but we do get Google Play pre-installed and it works decently so this is going for about 199
I want to point out are the pictures you're gonna see when you're going to purchase one of these so if we take a look at these you'll notice that the bezels are a lot smaller in these pictures but when you get it out of the box you'll notice that it's a chunky boy
I don't have one to test here but I'm sure it works pretty decently we also get dual stereo speakers up top here in the grille and it sounds pretty good standard power button and volume rocker one thing that
but that's really all you need with the tablet like this and the unit can be charged or synced using USB type-c it does have an 11.6 inch IPS screen but unfortunately it's a non laminated display so viewing angles aren't great like some of the real laminated displays out there
we have the mediatek mt6752 a 72 course at 2.6 gigahertz for a 53 cores at 2 gigahertz and for more a 53 cores at 1.6 for efficiency the GPU is the Mallee ta 80 MP for 4 gigabytes of RAM 11.6 inch IPS
non laminated display at 1920 by 1080 and it's sitting at a 16 point 9 aspect ratio 128 gigabytes of internal storage plus you can add a micro SD card up to 128 gigabytes 802 11 BG in an AC Wi-Fi
I had it plugged in for seven hours yesterday just to get it up to a hundred percent from around 25 overall the UI is pretty smooth here with the chip it's running Android 8.1
Netflix is super fast
or any of your other favorite app as long as it's compatible with this version of Android should stream just fine as long as you have a decent internet connection
Hertz now I'm not completely sure if I 264 is correct with this but the screen just doesn't look as smooth as some other tablets that I've tested with true 60 Hertz displays
I did run a quick Wi-Fi test and I'm connected to my 5 gigahertz Network 200 down 23 up perfectly fine for a tablet like this so now it's time to get into a couple benchmarks on the right hand side
fire 10 tablet
we have the m16
you might notice that the fire 10 screen looks a lot better than the m16 and I do have the brightness up all the way on the m16 so this is the Geekbench 4 benchmark on the m16 single core 1732 multi core 4000 177
I figured the m16 would beat this tablet out pretty bad and it did in single core performance but when it comes to multi-core the cheaper tablet wins this round next up 3dmark sling shot extreme on the OpenGL test the m16 scored a 1071 Vulcan 1137 the fire 10 dead beat it out in OpenGL performance but lost in Vulcan but overall these are right on par with each other and finally for the benchmarking section
we have antutu
this is version 8
on the m16
total score 120 3211 unfortunately the newer version antutu kept crashing on my fire 10 but I was able to run it in my review video and the overall score was a bit lower at 120 1516 but the fire
10 did beat out the m16 in the GPU test by quite a bit moving over to some gaming performance on the m16 here we have asphalt extreme unfortunately I couldn't get asphalt 9 from the Play Store it just wasn't listed with this version of Android
Call of Duty mobile
it's just really hard to navigate on this giant touch screen but I don't have this issue on higher-end tablets like the Galaxy Tab s for the s5 II or even the s6 now
I haven't had this issue with the touch screen it's just really hard to control and I spent about 10 minutes trying to get the sensitivity right so if you want to play something like this you'd be better off using a controller and this low sensitivity issue that
G I have this set to low and it's really not running that bad but when you get into tight spaces it's really hard to navigate with this touch screen and finally for my gaming test
we have minecraft
I tested these games
2.6 gigahertz CPU so we could be running into some thermal throttling here with mine but I didn't want to let it cool down because I wanted to check out how extended gameplay worked out and as you can see minecraft is a bit laggy when this thing's heated up
this is ppsspp running
OpenGL here I was actually expecting this tablet to run this particular game at around 2x2 even 3x resolution but even at 1 we got some lag going on next up some Dreamcast using redream this is Marvel vs.
we can go seems to be running pretty decent but if I tag in another character or there's lots of particles on screen it slows down tremendously get a lot of lag coming in and this is at the lowest resolution
there's really nothing else
so there's nothing else
you should be able to play some 3d games on it pretty well and this thing just isn't up to par so that's pretty much it for this video guys
thanks for watching you
that idiot comes
with 1.2 gigahertz processor 4 gigabytes a nano flash you know storage 512 gigabytes of RAM megabytes of RAM don't know why I said gigabytes Wi-Fi a camera decent and some backup comes with these apps standard and then Android 4.0
turn it around
the you know resolution capacitive touch which means by electricity you got 512 of RAM 4 gigabytes of storage a TF card which I can only assume is a memory card 3 mint 3 megapixel camera 360 degrees
you know the gyro
you could turn your screen this way this way that way or that way and it comes with a regular charger the regular one you get with like your Galaxy s2 same charger
Mike got headphones
and your memory card
just turn it on
I'm sorry about that
Jesus took forever
unlock it now
just go home
the controls are inverted
don't know why but see the other side won't work but doesn't really work as good as it should don't know why 30 frames per second on any video game which is really all you need
that's my review
I'll show you this
that's your home button
I had minecraft open
I pressed home so it keeps it there but if you press back it'll completely get off so don't press back press home for now on it'll let you access points quicker than reloading the entire game
well watch this
it only takes just a few seconds to load it when you have it on real quick real easy but if you don't want it you flick it off and it's gone and then you could reopen it there open the camera and bam now if I press back instead of home the camera shouldn't have been there but it was anyway you got your widgets and apps button up there rock all that out who come standard with Netflix
Facebook and fruit ninja
this is toys
I said wait a minute this is what Android no no this is Windows 8.1 with Bing that's the zero dollar version of Windows that microsoft offers manufacturers and I said well for 59 bucks plus shipping six bucks shipping if you get it for Micro Center
8.1 tablet seven inches
I'll enter my
it comes with 16
gigs of internal storage
only about eight are available once you've installed windows although I have to say first thing I did is sign up for free Microsoft Office for a year so I mean the full office for a year
it comes with it
I was thinking this is less than the tax I paid on my 1520 my lumia 1520 less than the tax I paid on the Lumia 1520 it does not have a lot of junk wear on it the first time I turn it on it said do you want to download he said I said no it said okay well uninstall and that was that because I logged into my Windows account I was able to download all the existing apps that I had on my other machines effect it said hey do you want to set it as Windows does do you
this is the full
there's no windows
yes mini mini
it charges via micro
USB so you can keep it charging while you're using your USB screen and you want to add memory there's even a little micro SD card slot here that can handle up to 64 gigs
here's Skype actually
sound is not great
it's got dual
is the video playback
this is youtube
high-def video plays back
Wow back yeah
Skype I guess
you're not you're probably gonna want to use it in the big tile mode in fact you're probably gonna want to stick for the most part with modern apps full screen modern apps because
I'm pretty amazing
I mean you're gonna run out of RAM but the bay trail is the one used in the transformer or TF 100 from last year it's a DJ's are great
but it's pretty good
that's our chat room
they're chatting at me
Windows is well tuned for this is Windows 8.1 with Bing which means all only thing that means is that Bing is the default search for the Internet Explorer you can change that to Google not a big deal
if you subscribe we cut you 72 months so you get a whole bunch of the computers free kids and we'll even give you a few bucks and get a bunch of one one dry onedrive store you get onedrive storage
365 subscription you
Office big deal
the price is unbelievable
1280 by 800
IPS screen very legible
it's terrible but again
you can you can't mess with it a little bit but you probably can't mess with it enough to make it super useful and even if you increase the the DPI for sure you're not gonna these icons are not going to get you feel like a giant right now
you can't oh look
it doesn't come with a stylus although you probably would want to use a stylus with it in many ways this is an amazing product that it kind of tells you a little bit about what's going on in this world of computers processors have become so inexpensive so powerful so low-power oh
this would be amazing
yeah by five yeah
Booya it's the win
can you believe that
hope it's not garbage
they're almost pointless overall
well it depends on what you're using this for but unless you plan on keeping this plugged in most of the time and do not mind the low volume audio
so it's a new brand so they sent me this package of tablet for me to try and i'm just gonna give them feedback anyways so let's open it up and see what's there so let's see here
happy new year guys
tablet send slab
looks pretty neat
now you got two pen tablet and i'm not sure i think that might be uh pocket thingy for the tablet and then there's oh there's also here there's a glove and there's a usb and all those things um all right let's open it up and see what's there
this is pretty fun
okay here
we go super awesome
stick it here there
we go okay
say thank you all over the place thank you merci gracias dunk center and has uh you can follow them at oh hashtag and create within slabs and got like all the qr code and things all right
it's pretty neat
so let's see
that's uh that's a pretty neat layout right so you got all these nips and usb so i guess i'm not sure this might be wireless or something and i don't think you need a battery for that
yeah this is fantastic
um and see how it works out and i'll let you guys know i'm just just gonna run a quick test for this video and then the next video i might run a longer test
there you go
it looked pretty promising
i'm excited and now we are going to take a closer look at the pen and all those package they are pretty solid and they got weight to it it looks expensive it feels expensive and it looks super legit and i try it and it's it's pretty nice
have these um wireless usb thing and you have the small two pens that came with it you have the smaller one and the bigger ones and this feels really nice
uh wacom doesn't have that so you have to like find your own box to keep your welcome pin so i think this is a very very clever idea to so i'm giving a couple artists from my studio to try it out
at first
i think it's the best choice out there in my opinion because i've tried a lot of tablet and a lot of time with the pen you have to put the battery in it
uh supposed to feel like if you use uh ipad uh pro before and you use apple pencil the way you kind of feel like it has momentum when you draw uh better than the wacom pen this one more so in between the the apple pencil and the wacom wacom pen
and i feel like the grip is a little more comfortable than the wacom tablet and i think it could be a very very good alternative to wacom tablet because so far um i think i really like it
uh i haven't got paid so and i've been using both uh wacom tablet and i've been using welcome complex for over 10 years and i really like the intros
and now i use the intro pro medium and i have intel pro medium and large and i think zen slabs has a very very good quality of this tablet
um and i think you guys should give it a shot and but it depends on the price point if your price point is like a little bit cheaper than wacom i would definitely buy it instead of wacom so but we still don't know yet
you can use it on zbrush that like what you saw on these uh small clips over there so you can use it for photoshop zebra sustain painter and all those kind of stuff the same as welcome tablet that you used to use them to do and on the next clip we are going to show you the painting um one of the artists from my studio
and now we're just gonna do some uh painting and um we'll see how it goes and i think so far the artists that i have them try out the products or sims labs um they like it and they said you know the next one they have to buy the tablet
how good it is
i'm not sure how or when would be in store for you to try it out but i think it's it's it is very very very very very attractive choice so uh thank you for censlab for sending us this tablet to try and for the rest of this video you can enjoy the painting and i will
try out this tablet
i think this tablet is very very good and i would use it myself um i actually i have this one on my workstation at work so i can like you know um it doesn't it doesn't feel as much different from wacom tablet
first off if you've never seen something like this before this is an rlcd screen so it is still an lcd screen much like any device like your smartphone however it's an rlcd screen meaning it's reflective and the first thing we will point out that you might notice when you grab this is that there's no brightness control and if you go into here and you go down to display there's still no brightness control because this is an rlcd you don't need to have a brightness control it is what it is it's in this constant state of being completely normal and easy to see under pretty much any circumstance so this is the home screen the vision os that all the hysense devices use
it's a very strange mix of it's almost e-ink but it's not and it's lcd which it is but it's not really because there's no colors so it's very gentle on the eyes you have eye protection mode which you can toggle on or off and you can have eye
another reason is another reason is power saving now because it is inherently a little bit different than standard lcd and it doesn't show any colors it is actually better on battery at half charge
if you have the data communication on the wi-fi whether you're even touching it at all or if it's just in a stasis mode but it is a little bit better than an lcd standard screen
it's a hard thing to describe on camera because this thing reacts to the camera different than it reacts to your eyes this device kind of looks different at every single angle
we are starting to see more oranges even with our eyes here in the studio when i turn it to the right the left side is getting kind of blue and the right side gets brighter
your mind tries to fill in color so it 10 of your mind says to you that you're seeing color but you're really not it's a very interesting thing to look at
it's not quite silver
it's not quite white
it's not gray
they will play play
in high definition
if you're just joining us once more it is not running ink so you do get all the fluidity of a tablet but none of that strain on your eyes and because it is a big screen because this is running a decent amount of hardware that making pdfs the experience amazing this thing is snappy
it looks quite nice
it's our lcd
this thing is absolutely amazing and it seems to be just the answer to most people's questions if you guys want to buy one of these it is on our store at goodiereader.com and don't worry we are going to do lots more
this is peter you
and now i've seen a few different videos on this topic and so many artists will tell you have to 100 do it this way or else it's wrong and i'm here to tell you that that's stupid
i currently have a cute my hero notebook that i bought to write down my ideas and try to keep me on track for each chapter this way when i start working and i forget what happens next
it looks like this
if you can some will take more time depending on what's going on of course but keep them very loose i'd say write down little notes around them and if they're too messy literally just write down
what an item is
it's just write it
i would also highly recommend typing out the dialogue in the past i would hand write it and it just it got so messy and it's way easier to type
some dialogue can change since i've been blowing through the pages so quickly which is good because it gives you time to think about the dialogue and more and what would sound better
so don't feel bad if you can't blow through an entire chapter of thumbnails in a day it's a lot of work and thinking once you have the thumbnails next
i typically like to sketch around five pages in one batch but i'm also prone to just doing everything in one sitting as in sketch lines colors etc which can also be exhausting so figure out what works best for you
a huge issue i had in the past was not finishing pages fast enough so i'd end up having big dramatic style changes for each update so a key is to work on pages regularly
i basically only finished a page per week in the past sometimes less now i can finish multiple a week even though each page takes longer than the old ones for you try to figure out what works best and the speed of which you can draw if each page is taking like 10 hours plus to finish because of the details and you're only updating a page every few weeks because of it then don't do that even if it looks good the inconsistent updates and pages taking way too long will completely drain you especially if you want to get to the more fun parts of your story for me
if i plan for it i can finish two pages in a day with good time management being able to manage your own time is extremely important when it comes to comic making
consider all the details that you add with that in mind because while it may look gorgeous in the end readers will only spend a few seconds on it before moving to the next page
just move to the next page because while i have pages i'm not a huge fan of readers are only going to be looking at that page for a couple of seconds and typically won't even notice the flaws
there's nothing worse than adding a ton of amazing detail to a panel for the speech bubble to get in the way when you start your sketches add the speech bubbles and work around them to make it part of the comic
so focus on them
there are a ton of pre-made speech bubbles in the manga section of the program as well as clicking on a new layer clicking this fun little icon and making the outline color black changing the main color to white or whatever color you want and just blobbing in some text bubbles wherever in whatever shape you want as of late
the readers
won't be so make
there isn't a wrong way to make a comic but there are ways to help you improve and make things less frustrating use references and read up on other comics and even manga to get ideas on how you want to do panels composition and so on but most importantly have fun
hello there tablet
not only that but it comes at a beautiful 69.99 but right now as i'm currently recording this it's on sale for 55.99 which is a really really good deal for a tablet
that's crazy you can use this on your phone so even if you don't have like a computer if you have a phone and it's an android phone you can just plug that bad boy right in one of the things that i also think is really cute about this
it's it's on sale
thank you so much
it comes with a really nice battery free stylus which again has a ton of pressure sensitivity really great eight express keys for if you want to do undos and like other little things on your drawing program which i think is really great
i in the past didn't really use the buttons on my tablet but i've been using them more and more so it's really good to have another tablet that has well buttons on it that i can click so i don't have to keep going back and forth between clicking on this and that and that and i can just set everything to my little tablet and i don't have to just click around and get my keyboard as i said previously the tablet works on android
of course so if you are drawing on a windows computer a mac system anything like that it will work perfectly fine on that and of course your android phone
please check it out
and berry onyx
it's it's so good if you hear any background noises because my roommate's cooking food by the way because i'm a professional for my 30 dollar patrons we have emma and lee

thank you thank you to all my patrons and thank you to all of my viewers for being so patient with me in these times when my gut and me are fighting i love you guys so much
holy crap
last month was wild
i'll see you later
I'm gonna do an unboxing review and how to route video for the Oh yuku m63 10.1 inch Android 4.4 tablet this features the all winner a 33 quad-core processor
here's the unboxing
yeah they just that's it that's what you get and there's a microUSB cable which is pretty good because it also comes with an OTG cable you can plug that adapter and put in a controller or a mouse or some other device so that's pretty handy and the instruction manual was decent
it's somewhat understandable
yeah not bad
I'll take it and a little warning to charge a thing for eight hours if you really need to be reminded to actually charge it and I'll just rip off that plastic and take a look at the exterior now
I've even got it
a widget
Android 4.4.2 2.0
Play Store by default
don't come with it
I'm going to open up and to to benchmark and look at the actual performance of our tablet with a nice quantifiable score that we can compare to other devices the m63 tablet known as device
ID v 11 here scores about 15,000 in antutu benchmark version 6 now this is a decent score for basic productivity surfing the web but going on YouTube and playing a few games
I own the first generation HP TouchPad also scores a very similar 15,000 and the Google Nexus 7 also a first generation device scores about 18,000 on this exact same test so that gives you a reasonable idea
when you view it from the side here you can see it's straight on as I play some plants vs. zombies too but if you actually pick the tablet up or try to view it from other angles it looks pretty washed out and terrible if you're gonna watch
it looks pretty bad
there's some terrible resolution cameras who are not even going to look at those now one of the best things about this tablet is the two gigabytes of available memory this is great for multitasking and productivity all the first gen tablets
ideally this should be the same location because your apps and all your data should be in the same location unless this is an older non data media built which means you have only two gigabytes the system storage here to store your applications
are this same now
I've actually checked that out and you can see here right from the report that it doesn't go over that even once I've routed the device I could not overclock it which is due to the kernel which will not allow for this to happen now
it only had three thousand seven hundred and seventy-five so that was nearly half of what it was listed at and when I checked other tablets there was quite a range anywhere 4,000 4,500 5,000 even up to 6500 mAh so these may be fraudulent
like this to make sure that you're actually getting the opacity you're paying for so this is a big downside to find out you're actually getting a smudge smaller battery in terms of battery health
you're gonna go anywhere from five hundred to a thousand depending on what you're doing if you're playing games so it was fairly average in terms of battery life but the capacity was way overvalued now we're gonna route the device
Android browsers around
just click these little arrows to get by it and we have to try out their purify app which we'll also install we can uninstall that later and it's gonna check our route status for our device here
so just try it
and we've been routed
routing app look for links for other routing apps that also install via apk such as a veeru's in conclusion the m63 tablet looks good online but it's poor screen quality limit app storage and small battery capacity can really hurt the value
I'd recommend this tablet as an introductory device for someone looking to try Android for the first time or perhaps it present for your kids who may or may not like the device might break it accidentally or may end up just putting on a shelf and forgetting about it
if you do happen to like this tablet you'll know what you like and you'll pay a little more for something a little better and you'll be quite a bit happier with it
hey Chilly with best black kid on his blog and this week my kids and I have been testing out at the Disney kids air book the Disney kids air book is a Android tablet it's made by Packard Bell up it is a Disney themed tablet as I've mentioned so it's straight out of the box it comes with Disney themed wallpaper it has pre-loaded 25 Disney books right on it and this is a kid safe tablet so you can control how often they use it you can control their content
I've done here
this kind of tablets
I have my own tablet and yet I can never find that tablet when I want to watch a video or I want to use it for work or whatever
I don't want him reading the news or having an access to the full YouTube network so I prefer to have him on a restricted account and then I can also watch how much he's using the tablet because when the tablet disappears obviously I have no way of knowing where it is or what he's doing with it so on the first screen when you load the tablet
there's also
I love all things
Disney though so is definitely has a lot of interesting content on there there shows games and you can go to Disney comm and check out what's going on there so some of the content that you'll find on this tablet is not accessible in Canada so the Disney now the games I have yet to click on a game that has been accessible in Canada
so the camera is 2 megapixels on the rear and point 3 megapixels on the front so that's not the highest resolution but it is designed to be a kid's tablet
I've tested out the headphones and my kids have tested out the headphones they feel very snug when they're on your head so I think they're definitely designed for a younger child about 5 or 6
they do expand slightly
I can
that doesn't happen
you have to hit the power button and then you turn it on by swiping up and then every other screen that you scroll through whether you know you choose these apps to use or or what have you then you can go down and that'll take you back to the home screen
the noise limiting headphones
my kids don't tend to turn them up too loud or I've never been overly concerned about them turning them up too loud so it is a nice feature though for little kids who don't have that kind of self monitoring so if
I even find that they don't even use it as much because it's always there so if they want to read a book or watch a video then great it's there and they have their headphones and they can do that
but it's not the constant lure for the tablet the Disney air book also comes in pink so if you have little boy or a girl who loves other color color
then you've got a great tablet with a great set of headphones and a lot of fun stickers right out of the box so that's it for my look at the
Disney air book

thanks for watching
I like to use my simple $60 Wacom tablet they usually last around a year and that was one of my biggest gripes with it but usually I didn't have much problem with it
I just wished that it would last longer and and it usually broke when Christmas time was just about to come and I was tired of having to ask for a new one to get rid of a potential present that I would get from my family
I call it a first world problem but still I didn't ask for one but I did complain to my mom that I couldn't draw for the time being because I didn't have a tablet and I don't want to sound like an entitled kid or anything but um I would like to warn potential buyers for this tablet it
I got this in December and it's February at the time of recording and the beginning of February even so it is hardly lasted two months and it's already having huge issues now the first issue that I had before you've been using it is that it is very very tiny and that could be a plus for some people but I don't go out much at all let alone bring my tablet with me and so I like to use slightly bigger tablets because when I'm using smaller tablets my hands cramp up a lot and because I draw nearly every day or at least a lot of times in the it it really catches up with your hands
I'm used to using my Wacom tablet where you don't have to charge or put batteries in your stylus and that actually isn't the problem with this specific stylus or at least it isn't because I have to charge it or put batteries in it
I have to put batteries in my stylus and so it screws apart and because of this when I am drawing and I am putting pressure on the pen with my my fingers it splits apart the the seam where you would screw off the half of one of the pen to put
and it really sucks when you're in the middle of a drawing and you're putting pressure on the pen and it just untangles even the only way that I found to counteract this is to hold the pen very very hard in the middle instead of using it like an actual pen like most of the stylus that I've used do
if that makes sense you ever have those times when you you have really old headphones and any any the only way you can make it work is to move it in a certain way or bend it in a certain way so that way the music or video
it's sort of like that the only way that I can make it work is if I contort the wires in a certain way or I have to make sure that I don't touch the wire which is very hard when you have to move your whole tablet to get certain angles
I don't know if this is a problem with anybody else but sometimes when I'm using my tablet it does some weird glitch or error with my with my cursor on my computer one time I was drawing and I had realized that the cursor for where the pen would usually be was missing and I didn't know what that meant and I unplugged my tablet and it still was like that and so I saved the picture that I was doing and I I closed my computer down and left it for a little bit and restarted
I plugged in my tablet again and that same glitch happened and so I know that it was from my tablet and this would happen even when I would unplug the the tablet itself
but it technically works inside but the original version of my sigh with all of my brushes pre-installed wasn't working with this sort of tablet and so I had to download a completely different version of sigh and I had to figure out all the kinks with that version and plug in all of my brush settings which is really frustrating and I even had to do it a couple times because this version that is compatible with this tablet is more difficult to use has different little kinks in it and I didn't like it
it does work
don't buy this anyway
this is pastel opal
see you later pebbles
hi there
so it will be quite comfortable to view outside it has a non glossy matte finish screen as well which is great great wide viewing angle display as you can see here as I tended around it a little bit of reflection there due to the lighting in this room
I forgot to charge the tablet before I started this video so I've had to plug it into power here but one of the beauties of the Q 572 and it's quite unique in this form factor in this 10 inch screen form factor
is that the
so that's a real true business feature you'll expect to get about six hours of battery life out of that one battery but it can be removed and easily swapped in the field or anywhere in two or three years time when that batteries reached the end of its life
they've been doing it for years now just while we're on that fact one of the key things about the Fujitsu and what they've done with both the Q 702 and the Q 572 is that they've actually made these tablets serviceable now for you to actually offer a business grade next day
I can remove to reveal a couple of screws and I can actually remove the back of this tablet now I don't recommend that you do that but it is actually serviceable and so a technician can come along here
a roof to cover remove the battery and he could replace something like a harddrive a motherboard or a screen on sight in your office unfortunately most other tablets like for example this
HP elite pad here
that's something that's very unique and it's very important for critical for mission-critical applications where this type of tablet will be deployed to more important corporate features that I want to show you with the Q 572 like the Q 702
it actually has a fingerprint reader here for security fantastic feature for security this zone if you have to log onto your tablet 20 or 30 times a day when it goes to sleep
there's nothing worse than having to punch in your password every time but with the Q's 572 you can simply just swipe your finger through on the back there like that and you'll get logged in just as simple as that another security feed an option that you can use is actually just in the top here if you can see that
you can actually just pop that smart card in there and you could use that to the system as well when it comes to connectivity q5 72s got the USB port on the side here full size HDMI port
you've got audio out on this side here on the other side you've got a second USB port and you've got your standard buttons for windows volume up and down and screen rotation you've also got a hardware wireless on/off switch which is great for flight mode you just simply flick the hardware switch to turn off your 3G and your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios in the device
dock for this tablet that has three USB ports on it and an Ethernet port so we can use this in the office to sync up within the network or or interface with other devices
and lastly of course we've got an SD card reader full-size as well which is great because it's always possible to adapt that down to a micro sd whereas it's not possible to go the opposite direction on the front
we've got a 5 megapixel camera there for taking infield photographs the Fujitsu for this tablet have chosen not an Intel processor but actually an AMD processor and that AMD processor is the Z 60 processor compared to the Adam series tablets you get much better performance out of the AMD powered Fujitsu q5 7 to a couple of other things about that because of the AMD on the choice of the AMD processor
this tablet does support
but if you're running 64-bit you can't run that on the aten processes that's found in a lot of the other 10-inch tablet so AMD has the capability to run that 64-bit operating system it also has the capability to take advantage of more than 2 gigabytes of RAM which the atom processors can't do the one negative about the q5
this is a tablet
that's going to be rolled out to corporate field inspectors and people like that who are working out in the field and walking around the tablets in noisy environments anyway
I probably might even notice the fan noise and having the fan there will mean that overall the unit gets kept cooler so the q5 72 is much better placed in terms of performance than your other tablets
now of course you've already seen here that the q5 72 has a really nice touch interface but it also of course has the intrigue active digitizer pen the same one that comes with the q7 o2 from Fujitsu
it also comes with a lot of other tablets as well and it's a standard entry pen but of course we can swap and change this we could use the the better
is this sony
end-rig pen that comes with the the Sony Vaio duo - this one here has a much finer tip and two buttons on it and it's a little bit nicer to write on the screen with so I'll go ahead and use that I'm gonna just bring up a Microsoft Journal here just so that we can do a little bit of scribbling in there
collecting data you might also see it being used by salespeople out there for example different corporate applications like that where an IT department needs to manage and maintain control of device
we want to implement good security practices and policies but also make our life that the life of the end-user easy things like the fingerprint reader and the smart card reader options make this rigid to a much better option than any of the other tablets that are out there in this
low-cost form factor
the Wacom cth 470
Bamboo tablet meaning
Microsoft ink on
however these do not work in the newer versions of Photoshop so you will have to switch to an Intuos to get those features it uses a USB to micro USB cable also known as a phone charger for Android devices alright
you have those installed you can switch it to left-handed if you're not right-handed change the purpose of the Express keys change the purpose of the buttons on your pen
six inch usable area because the edges do not work the overall length of the is 11 inches by 7 inches or 28 centimeters by 18 centimeters the rubber pads to keep it from slipping or missing on mine as well
what's up buddy
I'll give it a 6 out of 10 because it doesn't have photoshop functionality and you have to download drivers from the website and you usually pick them up for a lot more than they started as because they're no longer in production
way to go
let me get my life going to go ahead and open this up and the first thing we have is a box in a box and first we're going to take out the pin
some extra pen tips and a little clip to remove the pen tip and that little baggie up next we have the tablet wrapped in some foam next up the USB cable to connect to the computer and also a box full of manuals and one install CD
those don't come with
Windows or Mac
I think it nothing work but if that happens to you just go to web sites down with the software you need to get started now as you can see at the top where that blue light is that though without a programmable button it comes with three programmable buttons and there's a little menu that's probably installation see where you can go into the BAM Bluff tablet options and you know configure what you want those buttons to do now as far as the surface goes of the tablet from what
it doesn't it doesn't feel you know like you're writing on that on a piece of plastic for sure it does have a texture to it and it's a nice check
here is the programmable
if you're not familiar with these type of things is it has like the hover feature so you can hover over the actual tablet and it's kind of like the mouse pointer you can hover over without actually doing anything when you finally touch the pen down on the tablet
I have a mouse
what's unique about these type of tablets is if you're going to be like an artist you're going to draw like cartoons or sketches and this works perfect for you because with a mouse you really only have one level of pressure there is no sensitivity
my drawing sucks
I'm horrible at this
I'm drawing lines
I'm pressing down alright
I'm pressing down soft and that's pretty much how it works so basically you can draw as if you use an actual sheet of paper and it makes it more realistic and gives you that exact level of pressure that you need to draw the type of design or character that you want to draw so obviously like
I'm not really utilizing the level of the pressure but this is about as good as my skill stand right now so a little bit of that there over the hair right there there and there you go ladies and gentlemen Batman but here are some real artistic drawings that could be done on this thing you and don't forget you can also use
I don't like about it that it came with a very small USB cable so you might want to get an extension cable because uh if you got a lot of stuff in a way then the cable of the come was definitely not long enough
it's very short
so how does
we have our surface pro 3 here and we're actually going to put this in tablet mode because you can do that because the surface pro 3 is a tablet so the easiest way is to detach your keyboard and you get that prompt which you can set to always ask you to put in tablet mode and voila that is tablet mode so the first thing you notice is that your
that kind of disappeared
if you choose to and all the different quick settings there but as I mentioned all those icons that I had I would pin to my taskbar disappear but you can still bring that back which is a good thing and I wish you actually the other on the get-go so if you just right-click or press down you'll be able to actually bring that back up
so which means
I can go ahead and close out any applications are available so even if I don't know what's open if I had task view I can see what applications I have running
I can do in terms of the applications I can open and how I can pair them left and right so it functions well and you know it's something that I think
this is tablet mode
you can see there
I can also go into full windows mode - if I choose to so it's not something that's also you just limit it to just being in tablet mode so you know that's something you can do
well so let me go ahead switch to from tablet mode to Windows mode and let's go ahead and just close out some of the applications that are blown open here and you should be able to see that
that's something that they give you land and allow you to actually do with our Windows 10 so it's interesting um I would say maybe it needs some more work just so that people might have a better way of understanding your using it but I like it
I do like the fact that again like I can pin all my most user applications there on the task menu which is nice the one thing I would like is is if there was at least a lifestyle that said desktop so that I can actually go view my desktop much more easily easily rather than going into file manager to do that
so that's one thing
let me know otherwise
now the leagu d-pad 10 has a price of about 280 ringgit the the one that I purchased the cost unit 8 hearing it although there are other sellers selling at 400 mm higher but this is probably the best deal I can find at the moment at lazada and not only does it cost you an 80
so it's a good deal to have if you're looking for the LeapPad 10 at just you know 80 ring it with shipping you get a free headphone and yeah
free protect protector
I believe okay and this must be the micro USB cable so yeah that's it for the accessories so okay there's some description here quad core processor and as I mentioned already it even has GPS
do all the speaker's solid metal body and let's take a look around here here is the USB Jack for the micro USB cable and there is this as I believe the power button the volume rocker button and the earphone jack and I think this is the microphone
so let's remove this cover and I believe this this unit has some power in it this so that's just what the screen protector here doesn't seem to be well install properly
I'm seeing some bubbles
I've just finished setting up the tablet and using my Google account and signing in to Wi-Fi and updating some apps my first impressions of the Repat 10 is that it has an excellent display as I mentioned earlier
it's very clear
the volume is not the volume is not even 50% it's only 20 to 30% it's pretty loud for and I mean the speakers are pretty loud and if you look behind here these speakers face backwards yeah as I mentioned earlier
distortion is a problem
I noticed that sometimes
it's a bit hard to listen to to understand what the person is saying because of the devotees of distortion in the speakers but anyway for for a 400 ringgit tablet this
these speakers are actually very good so now let's do a little bit of a little bit of benchmarking tests testing on the the Guru lip at 10:00 and I have installed the antutu benchmark app
so if you're someone who plays a lot of 3d games stuff like that stuff that require high-end hardware then and this tablet is not the one for you okay so now
it's reasonably good
okay so right now
it's not that bad
you as i mentioned earlier and the i find that the output or the output on this jack is actually quite clean and that's very little very little circuit noise
I believe
that's a single
LeapPad 10 doesn't disappoint
I would recommend this
not only does it have good build quality and a nice aluminium body it also comes with this off folder which let me install this so you have pretty decent folder designed for the Repat tender you 11 holes for the speakers at the back and a hole for the camera and you can even stand so here are pretty good value for money
I would say so
hey everybody is lying
this is the new
IPS nice and bright
very nice to read on a good video performance on them as well all together a really nice display for a low-end device and again the display on the plus is the same as it is on the regular HD 8
here on you
but it's running the operating system in 32-bit mode so you're not going to be able to run 64-bit apps on these devices but the processor is capable of that should
that was nice
even on the base model now where the plus differs is in its Ram this has three gigabytes of RAM and this one has two gigabytes of RAM in most cases for most consumers that is not going to make much of a difference they will run games at the same speed essentially but the device with more RAM here
the plus will allow you to run more things at once and more easily switch back and forth between them and I'll show you a little demo of how that extra bit of RAM might help in a few instances but I think if you are somebody who generally plays a game every once in a while and then just browse the web
if you place
I'm going to talk about in a few minutes that I think is a good fit for that wireless charging feature and again wireless charging is on the HD 8 plus but not on the regular HD 8 and the last difference between the two is that the HD 8 plus comes with a faster charger in the Box
so if you were to plug a 9 watt USB charger into this one it will charge just as fast as the more expensive one will and actually both of these support up to 15 watt charging
I found that if you've got the display brightness turned down and you're not playing games on it basically sticking to the basics you can probably get close to that point probably in the 10 to 12 hour mark
not all that heavy
I like the size
if you got a decent sized hand here you can palm it like this the back is plastic so not the best build quality but I found over the years that these Amazon tablets can take some abuse without getting damaged too easily
I've had a 7-inch tablet that my kids have been using for years now and that thing has survived a lot and I found these things to be a little more sturdy than their low cost
the location of the camera is a bit odd for a tablet now as for ports both of these tablets have a USB type-c port for charging but it also supports USB C devices like memory sticks and keyboards and mice
so you can keep that card with you all the time again it takes microSD cards up to one terabyte in size and they can be always with you there
you might see that
maybe not but you will see that kind of changing over time and that is what the special offers are and occasionally you'll see something on the home screen here as well not too intrusive but if you don't like the ads you can buy a version of the tablet without them for a little bit more money
I'm gonna use the entry level one for the most part because these really do perform exactly the same and we're gonna start off with a benchmark so you can see exactly where this comes into play with other Amazon devices now
the benchmark we ran was the 3dmark sling shot test and as you can see we got a score of 937 on both the HD 8 and the HD 8 plus these are a lot quicker than the prior Edition HD 8 which was great to see but the Fire HD 10 from Amazon
more has a larger screen but again we'll perform a little better than these do but I was pretty happy with the performance overall and also take a look at the Galaxy Tab a that we looked at a few weeks ago from Samsung
now we've got Minecraft running on both devices here as you can see the HD 8 plus runs it pretty much at the same performance level that we just saw on the HD 8 the HD 8 here at the bottom just went into nighttime mode but minecraft is running here now if I go out of here and maybe select a different game to play
so here you go
we've got the HD 8 in a game we'll get the HD 8 plus into a game here same spot ok so now we had minecraft running and now we switched over to Sonic the Hedgehog now if I go on the HD 8 back to minecraft
you'll see that it basically dumped us out to the beginning of the game so whatever game we had in progress is lost because the tablet needed to make room in
might bring you here
Plus version to prevent your games from getting dropped when you switch to another app but for doing the basics here I think 2 gigabytes is going to be fine
I do want to point out right here that these Amazon tablets are running Android as their operating system but they are not officially sanctioned by Google and that means you don't get any of the official Google apps so instead of Google Chrome you get the silk browser instead of the Google Play
Store as you'll find on Google Play but if you bought a game on Google Play you might have to buy it again through Amazon in order to use it on this tablet you also don't get the official version of YouTube on your Amazon tablet
Google apps now
Edition and so right now I've got the regular HD 8 here in standby and I can just say tell me the weather in New York City today and you can see
now she's responding
and it's working a lot like an echo show device might work which is pretty nice to see and you can see how quickly it turned itself on to hear that voice command
you have the option here to put it into show mode and what that will do is kind of put the regular fire interface in the background and then have this stay on again similar to the Amazon echo show product which is pretty nice but this is one area where the HD 8 plus might be more interesting because they sell a docking station
but what you do here is you just put the HD 8 plus in it and it will automatically charge it with that wireless charging feature and it switches it into that echo show mode as well and I can show you how
once it gets detected it will automatically switch into show mode and you can see now it's switching and now we've got that interface and I can say show me the backyard camera and it will pull up my backyard security camera here and all is good
and what's neat about it in this mode is that you can just go right back to the tablet interface after you pick it back up again so if I close out the security camera and take it off the charger
it's going to switch back into the tablet mode here and you've got your device back so you don't have to go into that menu and keep switching back and forth the other cool thing about it is that it will also load up the regular apps while it's in that mode so here we go
it's challenging to get it lined up properly on the unofficial wireless chargers we're in that mode here and I can say to it load up HD homerun and it's gonna pull up my TV tuner application here and get it all going for us and I could really see this working really well in a situation where you've got that charging dock in your kitchen or something and you can just put the tablet in there issue a command from across the room and get your TV going with a regular app which is something that the echo show doesn't typically support so that's something that wasn't available at the time

ah it's so
Jesus okay okay
this is impossible
this game is impossible
this is impossible
I cannot play
I see no problem
I'm doing this
ah yes take my
oh wow aw snap
you is over
I'm just actually getting
oh man oh man
and and yes
it's it's guaranteed 300
what what is this
mmm yes burn
SB cuddle cable
I found it
oh that's really neat
that's very important
but it kind of tells you how to operate this this kind of thing how to plug in and as in how to install the CD the clock uses CD anyway
there is a manual
sounds wrong way
we have this part
is it a that
oh what's inside
I got a message
what could it be
I would done haha
ready only option
I'm sorry cook easy
I fed you well
I can find
yeah Oh baby I can already feel deep inside now pp and I can see puppies PP up in my mouth so yes hmm this is the easiest ever since I got my new tablet this tablet
look how fast
it has specifications
the price is okay
and and pennies okay
I don't think the weight matters that much I mean I know that kids nowadays actually weak but I don't think holding a bandit or battery should be a problem
my only problem with the pen is that it's kind of too big so I cannot find a proper grip unless I cover it with some with some tape and that can be a problem but I think that comes down to a personal preference so so yeah you'll be the judge
I did this tablet
but let's say 715
BB yes
I got this tablet for free so if you have a problem with that then go yourself and buy this tablet if you have at it so yeah thank you for watching and see you next time
this seal is still attached because I want you to do a proper full review from unboxing to download in the software its plugging it into my Mac and using it for the first time with you guys if you need to graphics tablets or anything like that it's basically a device where you can draw an input it into a computer a lot of digital artists
it is one of those ones so you have to draw and look at the screen while you draw it and I've had it paradius so what I'm reviewing is that 13 inch tablet and typically I like to use walks or whack on a very popular tablet amongst graphic designers and digital artists
it's something it's packaged
really really well
now check this out
the swing looks nice
it's actually really big
so it's copy
stand okay so this is the stunt just under my first impression to add the quality very very nice and the packaging is similar to that of a kind of party did
can you see
and it's got these rubber things here and the back of the tablet has the rubber rings so it kind of just stops it from slipping so in the box
we've got a stand
this is my
I've just propped it up to kind of height that wanna work at got like a little lip thing here that can hold on to it so doesn't sleep down so yeah
Sophia confirmed this hitch
tomorrow what a nightmare
hello guys it is now two weeks later than the first half of this footage and I have had such an issue with the adapters that I needed to order
so you need to be careful if you've got an Apple product or if you're an Apple user you need to be careful and just double check what HDMI exact dirty you need for my math witches in 2017 27 inch mark
it's turned on
I'll so I'm here
Retina display and the one thing I have found is obviously the display is a lot smaller and obviously this isn't a Retina display so there is some slight pixelation going on but if you have a small screen display you could probably play around with your display settings and adjust it accordingly but
I'm just gonna keep it set up because if I plan to work on this in the future I would like to keep it off so that my screen was the same resolution as it always is so
which is on here so everything is very very small at the moment first of all it's responsive and it feels nice to touch and this is quite similar to the bumble it kind of has like a press to it so when you press down on the on the screen it kind of presses in which is a nice a nice touch with the iPad
you don't have this
Wacom is very very old and obviously isn't built for kind of a 27 inch display so it used to do this kind of Jerry thing and it meant that with my new Mac
oh my goodness now
it's like silky smooth the pressure sensitivity is really really nice and down here you can see you can adjust the pressure sensitivity to what you want and do a pressure test over here
so what if
wah all right
okay you are
do you follow them
look off and double-check
I'm just used to a really good display so offering the settings over here you can change them so you can change what this button does on the pen and it's set to eat which is a razor and I want to set this to brush because I like it so cliffs drawing
so let's see if we can set this up for the workspace as well so work area press keys so this is set up as B at the minute so I'm gonna clear that and I'm gonna have that as control command Z
this is the undo
no it didn't work
ah it's because
I thought I would come to the conclusion so one thing I would say is if it was me purchasing this in the future I would probably opt for a larger screen but that is how I work
you can change your workspace accordingly but the first impressions are that everything is compact inside because of how large my monitor is which is a 27-inch monitor so to go from using Photoshop on a 27-inch monitor to a 13-inch display tablet is obviously gonna be a lot different for me so in the future I would probably personally prefer to get a larger tablet however that's not for everyone if you're used to it
I don't know but yeah so that would be the things that I would have to say about this tablet however the rules of this tablet is that it's got a beautiful matte kind of rough textured surface the second
it's really nice quality
it feels expensive
it doesn't feel cheap
I like the nib
the nib feels nice and sturdy and I like the way it holds them hand and I like this rubber bit here because that is very very comfortable to hold
it was very smooth very silky a lot better than my walk on and I will definitely use this tablet in the future so it is still a very good tablet for me
I would assume that most drawing tablets should have these anti slip mats on them anyway and this one does and the nice and sturdy when you put them on as a bench they don't slip about and it gets enough friction for them not to be sliding off your desk when you drive
when you're drawing which is a good thing and have cooling vents on the back as well which I'm guessing will keep it cool and what sessions are fun system building so it's not hard to touch that the minute
so overall if you're looking for a fairly affordable graphics tablet this might be for you you can also look at the larger size hue and do a variety of different sizes ranging from like 20 to 213 which is this one and I would personally love a bigger one and maybe in the future I might actually purchase it but for what I need it for
it does the trick
it might be a great start tablet for those of you out there not doing big professional-grade digital pinions and but even if you are and you're used to working off a small monitor it might still be or care for you
I just wish the brightness of the screen was a little bit better but I'm spoiled for choice because I use my iPad and I use my Mac and the screen technology on them is beautiful the only thing of an iPad is
but actually it's slightly smaller than this human is actually double if not more than double the price of this hearing and then on top of that you have to buy the iPad pencil which is 99 pound or 100 pound
however much it is
it always mounted computer
it can't be unplugged from your computer and it can be took taken home and drawn on it needs to rigged up like a second monitor so more like a wacom cintiq if you're thinking of getting the Wacom Cintiq this might be a great cheaper alternative for you
I haven't tried the Wacom Cintiq so I can't compare them but as a first graphics tablet I think this could serve you well and I think they've done a really good job over human for this
I hope you got some insight to this graphics tablet if you were thinking of changing the graphics tablet or maybe buying one for investments and I really like it I will definitely use it again and I'll probably keep this here in place of my old work on because my work on was on
its way out
hope you enjoy it
hello camera um windows
that um that shows up here when you unlock the um uh when you unlock the device and um as far as i can tell it should be just as good as microsoft surfaces
there's only three
it would actually have been handy if they added an additional usb c or or perhaps took one of the ones from the right side and popped it over here on the left because i tend to have a lot of the cables sticking out over here normally i have the
clutter that part of it but um just wanted to add those two things to my uh to my review in this uh this quick quick part 2 addendum to my review of the hp elite x2 g4
it's like a kindle but on steroids now whilst i'm raving about this product there are a few disadvantages to it which i'll get to later on in the video
so the back of the tablet actually has rubber seals at the top and the bottom this is preventing it from sliding and reduces the chances of dropping it now
as part of the 299 pound package it comes with a red folio so this protects and keeps the tablet nice and snug inside and it also has a small little pocket for your marker to go in now there are other colors and materials available at an extra cost now
speaking of the marker it has a comfortable weight to it when applied to the surface and it also has a really cool hidden package inside where you can just slide it out and inside is a marker tip just in case you need to replace it on the go
it's nice to be able to take this to work and use it in a meeting where you're not going to be worrying about the battery life or the tablet giving up on you like the e-readers and kindles we see
the number sometimes does not select despite applying enough pressure from the marker let's get to the nitty gritty included in the software are options for different notebooks subfolders and pages
i personally enjoy using these subfolders to separate my work content and my youtube content so on the page itself you have the option for different markers different thickness and different styles
oh no you can even select an area and resize it if your handwriting's too big or it's too small something that doesn't get spoken enough about with the remarkable is what is the storage capacity
it really is as thin as they say and it feels so much like paper when you go to write on it you can write your notes in portrait or landscape mode from lists line paper to dotted paper
if you found this video helpful then why not give it a like if you have any questions at all about the product then why not drop me a comment and for more tech and filming content
then why not subscribe
I'm cleaning
I have no idea
I have also intentionally not gone out to the Amazon page and read the reviews so I do not know exactly what to expect other than what the item basically is so they sent me an email asking if I would review it
so you can use though in any of those locations of course as well as the US which is what I'm using and you can insert micro SD cards into the side of the device
tab is a regular tablet has all the functionality that you would expect from a tablet you can download apps and watch movies and listen to music and all those sorts of things
all tablets can really tell when you're touching the screen or not but pressure sensitivity thousand levels of it so that the tablet can tell when you press scene soft or hard which makes it ideal for artists the same sort of thing that you would expect and get from your stylus pad
the device itself is about seven by ten inches with a screen of five and a half by eight and a half inches and I find that to be a good size
I love this screen
the resolution is 1920 by 1080 so that's obviously HD resolution excellent for watching movies but it's not quite as high as you might want from the screen and it doesn't keep up with like the iPad but again
I'm gonna be honest
alright you're buying it for the pressure sensitivity and the fact that you can draw on it if you want to use it to take some quick reference photos so that you can sketch on something later that makes sense but you're not going to want to use it to photograph
I've just been messing around here but let me show you a couple of things cause you have the regular touch controller and the pen so if you make a line here that line appears to the right of where I would expect it to go and that seemed like an error to me at first because like you you as an artist need it to be where you expect
iPad is but for whatever reason it doesn't so as long as you're aware of that fact then that's that's cool then you're fine but until you realize that then you think that there's something definitely wrong with it
it does mean that you can't use it in its standing position with the case because it will become unlatched if you use it in this upside down pose but anyway if you're going to be drawing you're probably not gonna be using it in the standing position
so you can't expect that it's gonna have as lower latency is gonna have very little lag and it's also going to have the lag depending on what brush and tool you're using
draw a character earlier and it worked just fine right when you get into some of these more complex brushes that have a lot more qualities to them and it's gonna slow it down
what you wanting this to be for and the way that I would likely use this is to do on location drawings I want to take notes do proper color sketches
then once you get your idea down then you can transfer that to your proper you know desktop computer be my iMac in my case and then I would finish it up there
it's fake leather
you can only sit in that light but you have access to those so you don't have to take it in out of the case to plug it in or put in your earphones or use
I'm not going to tell you to buy it or not buy it neither but I will say that if you're looking for a device that fits what you want with your expectations
it's a good option to consider so for $200 if you're looking for a digital sketchbook that you can take with you to do your simple sketches and notes and you know on location drawings good option all right
mind if you liked this review or if you're interested in picking up this device you can find the link for this in the description below and also give some bands your response of what you think about this
show them some of the stuff that you've done and if you like this review and me covering these sorts of things then leave me a comment below and let me know
welcome to this
that's a good thing
the graphics terminator review
this is tweet finally
no that's not what
I heard they said don't come back let Shannon host this show so lenovo has of course the well-known thinkpad line and they've got some high-end stuff but they also have a low-cost line the idea they do so one of their target markets
yes it's definitely budget
it's only 129
a1000 costs more
yeah yeah that takes
little sluggish yeah
these two are actually certainly close the micro USB charging port in the audio jack which may be a problem for something if you were plugging it in it might maybe get that fun ski gotten exactly but I don't know if you would be charging something at the same time
USB port is it's a ot G on the go which means that you can charge things at the same time that you're using this as well which is actually pretty useful if you have a whole bunch of different other products that you need to charge for example your cell phone if you needed to charge that on the go it's one it's less than 1 pound it's point seven pounds so it's pretty nice there it's about
you can only get about six hours when you're actually doing video playback but on a normal consumer use if you're just browsing the web and things like that you'll get about eight hours it has of course bluetooth on the inside
you get a nice stereo sound out of these two speakers and that was their big selling point for this is this is will be a good idea for anybody who is really obsessed with audio and house
it's an atlas
it's pretty decent
you'll notice a change
that sounds good
that sounded pretty
good that actually so
right here
there's no bad camera
okay froze there
so it's okay
yeah 80 bucks
Yeah right leo
yeah right it
just holy kiss
no we're cameras facing
it's not super hot
that's a displaced is so bad thinking if well once you do the pros and cons though my surprise everybody with your recommendation froze pretty good sound quality with the dildo dolby speakers little to no bloatware from lenovo which is definitely a plus
yeah screens horrible
really is the poor performance as far as the CPU and the processing speed go is definitely slow especially on the accelerometer and one very very low quality camera on the front
we still like those
that sounds that bad
Thank You Shannon
I'm not being biased
I don't but then again I'll be less harsh because I don't really know tablet so much and you haven't used any other one other than this one so it's honest because I don't even know if I like that much yet or hate it that much yet
okay she's kidding
so here it is
but like if you think you're gonna like like somehow like push it off push too hard then just put the cover that you came with under and you'll be so yeah two disclaimers though
they're not cons
yes it has this nice light when you try to go close to it within the radius which is pretty cool when you're using it just turns on itself which is awesome and it wasn't how many buttons which makes it looks pretty clean and so yeah
it kind of looks like it's more what's like 20 because of how plain it is but honestly this itself like to some people honestly is worth $10 and this voltec another
I think it's fine $3 if you want something even cheaper go for the bank but it's basically the same price I know wasn't cheap but like $3 is fine for tablet
you need the Lois
oh so anyways
Mon or this one
we'll try one
and they're pretty bad like look at the drivers so first of all first of all some things that I'm gonna say if if if you have if you have if you want to change tablet it's gonna be up to hard other than that
also if your cursor if you plug it in right if you put the tablet in right away and the cursor moves all the way to the left like that then you should
Monica okay to turn toggle on and off Windows anything usually housed in three just get just restarted cuz I got it and then I did a bunch of snow because I thought didn't open but all you do is go to the bottom arrow on the right hand side
and that's just yeah so plays gonna be on the tablet if you wanna see some gameplay on the actual like you want to see some gameplay on the actual computer screen then check out the other video that
I think the two choices you should make is between this one with a galvan because that's double into personal preference anyways and that's it for this few and the review of this XP pen
you know it
was you guys next
one peace out
what's going on everyone
my name is aaron
this is dad point 0. so a little while back i got contacted by a company called vast king they are a maker of tablets and accessories and they reached out to me asking me if i would review their latest king
pad sa8 tablet
so let's start off by reviewing the design of this again this is an 8 inch full hd tablet the front of this kind of has an ipad mini looking design to it
so it's not the lightest eight inch tablet on the market out there but with that all metal design i would say it feels more premium than a lot of the cheaper ones and by no means
that's supposed to block some of the blue light that puts strain on your eyes so that you can theoretically use this for longer periods of time without putting strain on your eyes and you can toggle this on and off in the settings but overall i think this is really good display on the back you have a 13 megapixel rear camera and then on the front you have a 5 megapixel front camera and they take decent enough pictures
they're not the most quality speakers on a tablet that i've seen when it comes to bass but like i said i think they're good enough for listening to music or watching a video internally
and i'll tell you what i've been getting after a couple weeks of usage and performance with this eight core processor and the three gigs of ram has been really impressive
multitasking seems a lot
more fluid and not quite as choppy with that three gigabytes of ram apps will stay open a little bit longer so that they're constantly closing so you can pick up where you left off
and i'm right about that number as well which is kind of funny because most of the time when i quote something you can expect it to be a couple hours less than that because of the way they test it but i would say i'm at that 11 hour mark with just normal usage emailing web browsing watching some videos and those type of tasks standby power
i left on vacation with this at about 40 percent of battery left and i was gone for six days and i came back and there was still 15 to 20 percent of battery left so this can stay on standby for days on end
but i've been really impressed with gameplay on this too i think the processor and the ram help it keep up and i've had no problems playing just about any game in the play store so overall
a little bit the top and bottom ones are really big especially with no button there kind of wish that they could slim this up a little bit but on the flip side of that argument
when you're holding this in landscape it is nice to have some place to put your hands and your fingers so that they're not touching the screen so there's a little bit of give and take with that argument second
i wish that the front-facing camera was hd would be nice for video conferencing and that sort of thing but it's still plenty fine for those type of tasks but it would be nice if it was hd but overall i really like this tablet and i'm really impressed
i love the three gigs of ram the eight core processor makes this really snappy and i'd recommend it to anyone that wants a really portable premium android 10 tablet
you want to do a little bit more multitasking than some of the cheaper tablets can do this one's for you so if you're interested in it i'll put a link in the description below where you can check it out
if you like this video press that like button appreciate it guys also make sure you subscribe got a lot more content coming out soon and as always i will catch you on the next video
effective engaging empowering education
what maybe we have
i'm gonna
android descent
calendar chrome drive files
let's go to the settings wi-fi connect to away frame still going right here but i'm referring to a number like if you're gonna put in the password files for for your personality so to your jumpers again so it cannot go into the the normal settings we had to put in the password right here but it's just coming back
i'm changing this
set it up
yes so so
yes so you can
it's searching you know
so yeah so
we tried the wi-fi but we don't know if there's a problem with our wifi even though it's working on off our cell phones and tv anything or it feels that the ebook is a logic to flow right or so but so we we use one of our hotspot sources and it's connected so it'll continue on all right so we're gonna go back to the home screen
i guess so
so you don't really know what that flash thing was but i guess it's updated but it's on iso it operates like a ordinary so yes it operates as a now
hold the volume
oh yes so
because that's really trying so we don't know if it's that video specifically so play another video play another video press back so it probably was that video the first video but yeah again so there's a volume opposite the power button just all right so the the speak volume is not the quality is not the best and not the best
it's like and it's not the worst because you can still understand what what's being said in the video or whatever you're watching so we don't know if it's because of the case or we're not
let's take a look at it here so what i was showing you guys because we can show you guys all the uh though all the the compartments right here does the usb here given maybe if i have flash drives oh something and on right here
the wrong hole is for the headphones the headphones so you can see you got a headphone so as you can see you got some headphones and this is this is a this a car like i think it's used it's basically maybe use the to keep no
it's because it's basically used to keep and keep track of the the devices and keep everything because maybe it's maybe program so without the the chip that cannot you can't walk through okay
i'll just eat something
yes yes so
here yeah back
went to sleep
we just cool
it's doing the same
yes so you have all the subjects all the subject even though you're not doing it there's this object here so all the subjects are on it already so we're going to select a subject and see what's say mark okay social studies from 3 and four
different contents
i love that feature
that's the thing
so yeah that's it for drive for the drive drive so we're gonna go to chrome and one chrome and see what we can access around right so agree and continue
yes password
yes which is it
people might ask if we can use facebook because it's it's uh social media that that is present in in this young in this generation everybody use facebook or something so and i said that they cannot use any social media so we shall try and see if it it enables us to use facebook
you cannot use facebook
try contacting the system admin see so i can see the ministry of agriculture as blocked so education so as you all can see the ministry of education has blocked
yeah yeah so no
uh i'm gonna try
i'll check good app
google www.google.com is blocked
we don't know why if it's you know if it's like a like a if it's only a book that you would learn book is only for books and not to research so it got easier but it doesn't really make any sense if you use that electronic device and i cannot use it such so there's a search engine
yeah so we'll try
clear data
we already had
it looks very luxurious
protect it device
there's no camera setting
oh yeah so oh
maybe like let me show you posted a video explaining the features more more detailed of the ebook markup there you go learn book yes one book so yes this is a basic thing
only school work
i'll receive it well gita a full because it's not really the reason why i said four because it's reason why he got a full because it it can still
it's still do
maybe if it wasn't for the one book where there's all the that's a great feature that's right so that one he'll build up there the five consistent of the youtube stuff
it's a good
it's a good device
it's a good device
yes yes it's processed
nothing's very slow
yeah really heavy
because like i don't know if it's a keyboard but feel the tablets like if you're holding the keyboard although maybe you can break break the the keyboard tipping it over so turn off
yeah yeah see
it's very thick too
that'll feel it no
so like it won't fall out it won't break apart so this area because the tablet is technically like it's a rent technically because like you have to return it after a while
you gotta return it so you turn it and if you broke it and if it's damaged you gotta p to fix it or whatever approximately 300 usd if your master if it's damaged but we don't know what type of damage is for intern
but if it's getting damaged or something it's a little bit meter damage you're gonna have to use it on still but even made it down because if it was to fix it it's just just pretty easy but anything major that you know how low to access it access the device again that way you might need to bring it in and pay a bit of money so yeah that that i guess that is awesome
that's that's good decent
there's two places to insert a usb usb two places that's great that's that's a good feature that's a plus let's see oh yeah that that might bring back up that five that kind of headphones and such i bring back up to five
hey what you want to pay 50 dollars gotta be if they don't pay for the boxes as yet in the school you need to because the book program is 25 dollars the so it seems like the book program like you're renting the books here in the tablet the the one learn
yes so yeah
it's an ebook program
yes and if any more ideas for us to do comment down below and don't forget to turn on your post notification so it can be alerted when a new video is posted so turn click the bell right beside the subscribe button
that's the right way
A battery free pen
no need of recharging
and the tablet
i might have to move my desk um because the sun is so bright every time i come in and it's only going to get brighter as the summer comes
um so i think i'm going to have to rethink the placement of things in this room kind of i don't know but i can't keep sitting like this um so i might do that at some point today
i have two zoom calls going on today with patrons uh one in about two and a half hours um yeah two and a half hours and one at six o'clock tonight so it's a very long day here
um even when i'm like not feeling up to it i might pop a story on there or something so yeah come follow me um but last week was just like a heavy week emotionally a lot of things going on in the world and i just need to take a step back
i feel energized
um which
sometimes i might do
you're watching this
i wasn't sure what i wanted to do but i wanted to do something to give back to the people that have supported me on patreon and i thought what could be better than a market like an online market where we come together as a community and um show off our products and it went so well and some people got
i um was approached by studio this time last year when i was a much smaller account and they were so kind and they offered me some earphones to try and to chat to you guys about and to um to promote and i this is the honest truth i um i declined and i declined because um i didn't feel confident enough
i was so worried
i didn't need any so i felt a bit uncomfortable doing it so i didn't think anything of it left it um and then uh the opportunity arose again and um i thought you know what yeah why not
i can't wait to try them and talk to you guys about them if i like them so um basically i have some headphones you might have seen um and these are really good ones
they're noise cancelling
these are amazing
um and i'm using them a lot now that i'm in this office um like if i do a zoom call or if i do anything like that i pop them on because um obviously there's like a microphone in them and i can hear other people um but they are big
these are the ones
they've gone with
while you're on a call four wing sizes allows you to find your own comfortable soundscape to soaring up to 20 hours of playtime for life on the go so right
let's open them
satisfying plastic removal
let's see yeah
that doesn't feel comfortable
ah oh oh yeah
these ones
okay that's exciting
where's your music emily
i'm such a grandma
okay they sound wonderful
it started again
i've paid my share
cause i'm almost there
like i just said you get a free care kit which i haven't been supplied here to show you but um that's cool that's worth 25 pounds and if you put e harvey at the checkout i will show you on screen and you get 15 off so like it's another 10 pounds off on top of it so i think they're great if you're looking for earphones
why not
i think they're wonderful
they're pretty wonderful
um it's now 25 to one um and i don't know what time it was when i was chatting to you but i have been prepping for this zoom call like i was prepared but i always panic about an hour before the call in and i just think like why are these people gonna listen to me talk
it's my way of chatting about things and thinking about um and getting other people's opinions um and that's that so anyway i've kind of written notes out and what i want to cover um and it's happening in 25 minutes so during this time i've had my headphones my earphones
so that's good
um which is fine for me on my desk but could be an issue if you want to charge like next to your bed or something like that um but yeah
so hi guys
these were awesome really
they're really good
so that's good
that's all i've done
next task is orders
let's log in
that can go so
there's stuff everywhere and i have got my lunch though so i'm going to sit on the surface and then i've also had some peel boxes so i will show you those um before the end of the video
okay so i had one sale um well no i had two but i have a pre-order happening right now on my website for my patrons so um one of those came in but i can't actually fulfill that audio because it's pre-order so i've had i've had one order so um it's actually for a sticker pack which i don't have here or do i so i need to um i need to make some stickers for it i lose my breath whenever i see you
you stole my heart
you're my heart's desire
i just wanna love
i need to get everybody who is taking part onto my website um and we have over 150 about 150 makers i need to get their content onto my website
but it's fine
because i've got everybody to upload their images and things to a google drive folder and i'm just like adding them so um it's not the most exciting content for you
my shoulders hurt
she sent me this lovely mask which i'm so grateful for because my mask is not a nice one so this is really beautiful and then she also sent me this scrunchie
it's called the emily
those are so nice
and then i got a print a couple of prints actually um and some stickers and these are from danny doodle so danny is part of my patreon and i actually think these were done as part of my art challenge we had to like reimagine characters
i didn't even notice
i'm really conscious that it's just so hard to do but where i can i will um but i am so grateful for anything you sent me um but i actually do have two envelopes here so while i'm waiting let's get them open
thank you very much
because like some of the things she makes are so beautiful um it would be such a shame you know um for them not to be seen by other people so what i really love about
it's so special
the next envelope
oh so funny
um these are some adulting reward stickers so it says put a bra on hoovered got out of bed leave those stickers and then we have some prints and some postcards which are really cute
um so yeah
i think i am going to move my laptop and i'm going to do tonight's theme call over from my sofa and get all comfy and cozy and i always feel better about doing the second one because because the first one's normally gone
um i did it on this laptop and i had to set up a uh a light because it's so dark um it was so much fun there was like over 30 people on that call then and it just it brings me so much joy um doing them
i've packaged one
order i've opened some goodies my headphones which i had to take out uh during that zoom call because the battery died so i definitely didn't charge that right but i have to say i'm so impressed with them
um so once
it's honestly brilliant
i'm gonna relax
thanks for being here
i adore you
bye guys you
oh yeah and this
okay so first off i make a reference sheet i take any character and make a character turn around or at least some drawings to help me familiarize myself with it this way
when actually moving their bodies it's one thing to draw them once in an illustration but it's a completely different ballpark to animate them multiple times in different perspectives and movements
but for this video
i use a red pencil to make the head and facial features but this is only a sketch to help guide me with the rest of the animation i copy paste this head into different layers but i make them in slightly different heights
she's a melting sponge
bob popsicle now
however there is only a max amount of frames i could put in before it starts bugging so i only keep this for short segments of animation continuing on my animation
bucket pretty self-explanatory
anybody could do it
oh yeah and i found a neat trick to help make the characters look more lively with minimal shading i just color in the lines with a dark color and i leave the outer edges black to make it look a bit like a sticker and there you have it shortcake and her hair flopping up and down i slip the frames into video editing software
get ready kiddos
pen tablet
this tablet is huge
the gaomon m10k 2018
however it's not that sturdy since sometimes my styler slips out and that's how i accidentally broke it on my garage floor my bad besides the pen the box that the tablet came with has a bunch of items which is probably a special gift for me
this includes a felt pocket filled with a plastic baggie containing extra nibs and a metal ring that can take off the nib a drawing glove with a thin silky material
kind of like satin a drawstring bag which seems like the same material as the glove but it can fit the tablet in quite snuggly and a couple of papers with printed ink on it
would i recommend this tablet if it's for beginners or those who wants to start doing digital art heck yeah it's literally half the price of the smaller wacom tablet
i made all of these with justice tablet and you can too really of course with a lot of determination practice suffering and a drawing tablet you can become an animator like me
oh yeah and gammon sent me a video which basically explains how you can get some free goodies with your purchase of the tablet when you click on the first link in the description which sends you to the amazon website
just scroll down
choose between free
it's awesome that you're tuning in because in this video we are going to take a close look at the new 2021 media tablet the question remains is this thing fake like the other versions
it's too good to be truth but still i just wanted to check it out for you guys to begin with we're going to get the famous toilet paper manual from france from china in black and white so not even the deluxe edition
supply is the european version having an adapter from micro usb to a normal usb if you want to use a controller and here having the normal cable usb to micro usb so that's it especially for the video is going to be plastic fantastic and of course another one on the back okay
so this tablet this model itself is has a very big plastic fantastic casing and it looks similar like the first generation ipads but when looking at the 2020 model
yep look at this so the front plate that is made of plastic is not even fitting in perfectly and it's on this side but also on this side so this cheap tablet thing oh man the quality is really bad
it gives a little bit more quality feeling so this 10.1 inch tablet comes with a very big bezel and i also noticed that the displays are using not ips just in basic lcd
you can see
don't even think about recording with this thing because the audio and the video quality is very poorly but i also wanted to zoom in so you can see some details of the plants outside but overall it's pretty shady of course
i mean the camera so on this side we're going to get the on and off switch volume control of course and last but not least and then on this one
and we're having two stereo speakers and i can tell you these things sound very tinny really bad okay so i needed a screwdriver to remove this plastic blade but here we can find two slots for a sim card
i would say hey
so let's go back
let's check out ada64
okay here we
oh man oh man
you can see
how good is it now in 2021 when it comes to playback 1080p is the maximum that we're going to get from youtube but it's more like a 4k sample
let's see how it handles on this old school mediatek tablet but i have seen my share of shitty products especially when it comes to these android boxes and other stuff but in my opinion is not really bad
so this is the end of the review we can maybe going to call this the trilogy of the fake tablet from china because this is the third time that i bought one completely different specs but in the end it's still fake and i just wanted to check it out for you guys
10.1 inch tablet
doing china
you get a case
there actually really nice
there the tablet itself
it's got a metal metal back so this has four gig of ddr3 ram 64 gig memory and you can expand that with a micro sd card up 128 gig
that's pretty normal
you get usb to usb c connector adapter you get a sim tray adapter and you also get a usb to micro usb charge cable for the bluetooth keyboard so you get quite a lot of kit just chucked in with this tablet so we will start by
youtube youtube kids
try quick game
and yeah drive and simulate games etc not really a fan of this game but downloaded it to show you that the tablet can play it and go along clear
let's say storage
let's see pretty standard
google setup
it's nice and smooth
it's picking up the 4g 4g signal so i put two sim cards in so if we go along to the sentence you can see their mobile network waterfall new gear auto uk one long
say sim cards
that works fine
the case and the keyboard works absolutely fine really nice additions to get with the tablet for the price that you're paying so it's about as much as i can show you for now
it's not something
so the tablet
I definitely excelled my animations and drawings but I still enjoy it and you improve every single time you draw so I decided to draw a character from the next episode I will be releasing
okay but back
it only has two wires coming out of the tablet itself wherever tablets usually have like free which is kind of annoying so that was nice but what was really nice about
this tablet was already had a screen protector applied to it and it was mat the best kind as it gives you a paper feeling when drawing and he didn't have to apply it so there's no risk of any bubbles happening so that was really good it has eight customizable buttons on the left in a good position and on the side
but it didn't seem to bother me too much when I was drawing so it could be ideal something I've not used before is a battery freed pen which I loved
you should be good to go and one nice thing in these settings is to try is the orientation swap you can change it to be portrait or landscape which is pretty cool
I did find it really easy to use and I thought the pen worked really nicely and had good pressure the monitors show good color resolution and for a tablet for a display table
it's pretty light overall
price for a display
tablet is definitely good
the pen is great
I would have preferred it to be a bit wider horizontally to make a nicer workspace and the main con for me is the scratching on the tablet when using I've drawn on this for three hours now and it's already got a lot of scratches on the surface which is really disappointing compared to other display tablets out there
and that's my review
I wanted something simple rather than going all in on a drawing which obviously would be more beneficial for a review but I think this tablet would suit more comic artists in general so that's why I went for
I'd be putting out on this channel in fact you could probably say that it's abnormal to some extent and that's why I'm making it a bonus video in between regular weekly content for the channel so that way nobody can complain and if you do
I can actually see what I'm drawing instead of having to watch the monitor like I did with my old Wacom seriously on this old thing it felt like I was playing pretend art for the longest time enter gal Mon these guys send me an email recently asking me to review one of their products those of which being as you may have guessed tablets
oh my god
whoa in return
Club and a guidebook for setup that all being said though it doesn't come with a stand which sucks there's also zero way to screw it in to any potential stand that you might buy either because it lacks none of the parts placed on the back to do so like other tablets sometimes have
and while you're drawing it could have the chance to slip off just like my [ __ ] of an ex-wife thankfully though it does have grip on the back but again there lies the problem much like my [ __ ] of an ex-wife the grip only covers the four corners meaning that the center has no grip at all
now mind you
kind of like a flat piece of paper on a table though most of the time for health reasons this isn't necessarily recommended as our Lord and Savior kayo once said my neck my back
that's gonna take looking at this thing for long periods when it's flat down so if you're anything like me and you have this tablet on a flat surface like I do
I did get used to it after a while despite some initial discomfort what I ended up doing is taking breaks while I was drawing and instead looking at the monitor while I did my art for a bit in between looking at your original monitor and the display is a pretty easy way to work around this whole discomfort thing although it would have been cool if I could just sit back and look at my display without any sort of discomfort for long periods
now let's talk about set up because setup is pretty important when it comes to tablets or else you can't use the damn thing so great news putting this thing together isn't hard like not at all
I haven't had this problem with these drivers so now if I want to use my old tablet I can just plug that in and use it no problem at all
while this doesn't get in the way of my work that much it is noticeable and leaves me to look up at my normal monitor to check and see if the colors and line art
some of it is current works in progress and aren't finished and some of them are just really quick drawers for a future thumbnail or two as well as a couple of pieces from some projects that I maybe want to publish online at some point anyway
the screen has a super nice texture that works to make drawing on it feel natural and similar to how it feels drawing on paper although honestly upon initial use
I had to deal with random jitters of the cursor and an inaccurate brushstroke from time to time but this can usually be fixed by just messing around with the tablet settings
so if you're like me and you're using a Windows computer and you want to turn that sucker off you're gonna want to turn off the windows ink checkbox located in the settings any sort of discomfort of the hands due to friction while drawing can usually be helped by wearing the included glove in the kit
and bad feels on your draw and appendage it isn't always necessary but I did end up using it a couple of times although if you're a big hand boy like me then
tablet user like me
it does have a couple of issues that I've discussed before and better alternatives do exist just with those being a little bit more expensive so all in all just to reiterate if you're like me a fairly average novice and still-developing artist
I didn't think to do that so I'm just gonna talk to you about my gastrointestinal problems until the audio fades out so recently my gastrointestinal tracts have been having some blockage and I went to the doctor and he told me that they don't really have any diagnosis for what's causing it
I'm really concerned about my health and honestly I don't know what to do next because no doctors are able to diagnose me and they say that I might go back to the hospital at any point I wanna
Gregg winter egg here CEO Matterhorn business development and I am back by popular demand to do my next review of the remarkable writing tablet the version 2.0 upgrade has come out and I'm going to just show you how I use it now to be clear
this one is pretty well done after about three or four weeks you cannot tell the difference in performance of a tip that is like wasted and shot to a brand new tip now
I use this
and here's last week
I can go to the paintbrush and I'm gonna write today's date now if you look and I go back to the page overview now if I want to scroll back and find today's staff meeting notes it's very easy to find these bold dates and I can immediately
I have one folder
that is nothing but clients that we talked to once a month twice a month once a week twice a week whatever it might be and they have their own notebook and so
I'm just looking for the date that I spoke with them and then I can look at all of the data that I'm getting now another really cool thing just with regards to the stylus and how it works
wait a minute did
oh yeah
and these are critical things that I need to put on my to-do list and that'll be coming up when I when I do the next video on how I take the tool system and integrate it with the remarkable system so for me this just helps me find information rapidly and it's all organized folder by business other folders within that folder notebooks
I just made a call with regards to Matterhorn and I just got an email for somebody on a project with the nonprofit so I push this button I push it twice
I go to the nonprofit page and I have a folder here for communication for the nonprofit and I can just quickly go and scroll to the last page and jump in and make notes on this email maybe I get a phone call so I find this priceless because I'm really able to keep track of email
communication to do's that
I'm responsible for and I also record every phone call even if I'm in the car and I get to my destination and grab this little baby and I just quickly punch in who did I talk to what was I supposed to do
I think is awesome so you can upload PDF files on to the remarkable pad so I have a particular piece of promotion that I've been working on for the nonprofit and I have the PDF file here loaded onto the pad and let's say that this does not look exactly the way that I want it to look and I need to make some edits so now I can come up here and I can get a broad stroke with my ballpoint pen
so let's say
I don't want this picture and the logo up here I want to reverse it and send it down here and then I want to take all of this other information and I want to move it up there and my designer is amazing
I can send an email to her so I'm going to send the the edit that I just did to my designer now in this particular case she'd be very confused if I sent this to her so I'm just going to send it to myself but recently used emails are up here
I'm going to send it to my email at the nonprofit I can hit this and I can add a message if I want to change the name of the file
I hit Send
it's gone so
I want to show you something else that I've done here where I need a landing page for the nonprofit and what I was able to do is I had some thoughts in my head and I'm definitely not an artist but I was able to sketch out this landing page and this particular screen is how I want this to look and I send this off to my web designer so I sketch it out I go down here
I can just quickly get these types of things done and then the Edit the email the PDF file it goes right out now it will not download a Word document it has to be saved as a PDF
I can do the same thing with a client so at Matterhorn we are certified profit first professionals profit versus a book that was written by Mike McCalla once and it has a profit assessment form so what I have done is I have uploaded the standard form on to my remarkable now when I'm sitting down with a client I can go ahead and just gather some basic numbers so I go up here now and I want to be sure that it's on the ball point setting I want to be sure that it's on the medium setting not thick or thin so I have the the width of the the pen that I want and we can write in the clients top-line revenue
I can just click off how much profit they had except cetera based on their profit and loss that they've just giving me and we can now do just a real quick profit assessment
I email a copy to myself so I have a record of it and now I just get rid of all that work because it's been saved and emailed and I've got my blank form again for the next evaluation
2.0 is the quick sheets so I'm I'm on the phone and I need to jot down a note and somewhere in all of these folders and notebooks is this person's data but I don't have time so I tap on the quick sheet button
stop the shipment
it's in just a
almost all right now
it's really cool
I come down here
here's what I want
I want to send it to a Matterhorn fuller and gonna send it there and so now I just click on move here and now it's in the proper place
paint brush stroke
I'm using version 2.0
with regards to what
I can email how I can make these edits and mainly how I can move all of my sheets of paper around from one folder project to the next so again I love my remarkable
come get yourself love
come get your yourself
everybody needs some love
hi folks
along with the $49
screen does have really strong viewing angles so I was quite impressed with this tablet when I first opened it because I was surprised by how thin and light it is it really is about the thickness of a pencil
there's a micro
SD card slot right there for cards up to 128 gigabytes and then everything is located on the top edge as far as the power button the volume buttons the USB port mic and the headphone jack
a lot lighter
viewing angles colors are nice and bright but it does have the lower resolution and some of other of Amazon's tablets and some of the other tablets on the market right now
Samsung's tablets
I mean it looks fine for the most part text does if you're reading with text this size if you're using smaller text you're going to get more pixelization and you're going to be able to
the text is going to look kind of fuzzy when you use smaller font sizes but when you're using the anything alike above this level looks pretty good so one of the main differences with this year's lineup of fire tablets
is this new fire
OS 5 operating system
Amazon used to have everything laid out with the carousel on their fire tablets so I really do like this new layout so this is like the whole way the homescreen lays out now
every app you get installed on your device gets listed here you can view your other apps from Amazon by hitting the library so everything has this same sort of layout here on the home screen where you have your content shown like this and you can scroll down for more and if we go over here for the books it shows your recently read titles and what your recently working on here and then you scroll down you get like the recommended titles and it's the same thing over here you got your library
all your recent activity you can go ahead and remove stuff by long-pressing on here can understand it or remove it from the home then when it comes to the list this list right here
and these three are installed from the one mobile market so you can install apps from other app stores because Amazon's app store doesn't have a whole ton of apps but it does have a good selection but doesn't have some things like Dropbox and alternate reading apps like milk and stuff so you have to go to a different App Store for stuff like that
ok so what you can do with these apps is you can rearrange them just by holding and moving around so if you didn't want something to appear at the top you can move it to the bottom if you didn't want the store link or whatever you can actually group apps together if you wanted to make a hole like a folder of Amazon apps or whatnot so then you can just create a folder and drag your items into the folders when it comes to yours your installed apps if you hold down on them you get the option to uninstall them you can also uninstall them from the settings menu in the manager app drawer so that's just sort of how the new layout the homescreen works
Android tablet and there aren't any kind of widgets or anything like that but if you really did one some traditional Android home screen you can install different launchers so I installed nova launcher here
you got the regular kind of app drawer that you can move stuff and organize onto your home screens however you want the only downside though is you can't set it to your home button anytime you ever use the home button
it's going to take you back to this home so like you'd have to put the app up there so for quick easy access if you wanted to use an alternate home screen because it won't set as the default all right so let's move over to these other sections talk about some of the kindle features for e-books you got the basic same sort of setup is you can have on any Kindle Fire tablet
you tap here
what's that button
oh yeah that's your notebook you can go ahead and access your notes and highlights from right there and then a couple of the other advanced reading features got word wise would add some simple definitions to the roads
got the x-ray features so let's talk about the audiobook tie-in you can go ahead and use the audio books if you have them download with this to sink back and forth with the people
she's got good sound
get the dictionary and the word wise this also pops up right there so you can get some alternate meanings as well all right so you can load in your own videos of course it ties in well with whole
so this comic
it looks fantastic
as far as the colors are concerned very bright very detailed but when you have it in portrait mode like this the text is actually not really that comfortable to read
it's actually quite easy to read that way but when you do have it in the portrait mode you do notice that the pixelization more because of the low resolution screen but it is still readable
not having any responsiveness
here's a sample of
YouTube videos work
well if you load the if you in a lot of them load that you had mobile site by default and the video quality won't be as high so if you go over here and request the desktop site you'll get the higher quality video so they'll play either way
ebooks deals so
right hi guys
I have just bought us off a new tablet so I thought I'd do an unboxing just to show people what it's like and then I'll probably do a little review once I've used it as well so to start with
and they
they've got the capabilities of a Wacom but a fraction of the price which is pretty good they use a Wacom Intuos Pro of work which is a really nice tablet to use
I think they're about 300 quid for an into us with all of the tilt and the rotation functionality you know that so previously I've used a Huey on tablet just a regular kind of standard one and it was a basic one but it was about
but it's got bluetooth
the previous few
a very rarely a pick up a pen if you like our charge and I'd have to charge if half an hour before using it and you can use it with the pad with the thing plugged in as well
obviously if you're trying trying to paint and you've got a cable hanging off the back of your pen but the new ones knew it knew who young ones are coming with the battery free pens so
a little wait
I'm super nice
thank you card
it's very polite
that's protective film thing
it comes with a wireless dongle anyway so it turns to the connection on and off and the USB port there I'll probably tend to use my wired all the time I mean
I get on with
I'd be annoyed if it was if the the Bluetooth ran out of battery while I was using it but maybe I should try and see how long it lasts and so the little button there is over to another switch
I have no idea
I don't know the exact measurements but it feels very comparable to the one that I use at work a little bit bigger than the ones that I've been using at home so that's good a lot bigger than the the WAC and I've been using it off which I'll just grab
this is the temporary
it's it's good when something breaks on my tongue myself and I just need you know a basic tablet to do something but it's tiny so you do a slight movement on this and it's a big movement on the screen so with this one
so it's the tablet off for that time as well so other stuff that comes in the box it's got the wireless dongle I I'm assuming it's a bluetooth dongle
Everett rusty penholder
these are always handy
it's it's not so
I just don't need to do as much motion in as much brushwork as some people do so I just tend to not get through the nibs but maybe I should look and see how much they do wear down
but it's good that this is there's a load in there that's like 10 nibs so either expecting you to go through them very quickly or they're just given you a long lifetime for that for the tablet but this little donut shaped pin holder
that's quite the pin
it's so quite look
the previous huion tablet
I used was missing the the kind of this kind of bump at the end of the pen so I would find that if I was working for a long time my fingers would sometimes slip down and it just made it slightly uncomfortable
Wacom Intuos pen
I'm not sure but I'll be happy to just use it normally like a pen or a pencil and just use it from down there and oh yeah it feels instantly quite comfortable to use
just hold out though
that's pretty good
I don't know why but like I guess yes it will probably be a QR code or something that it's got the one on the back there that will link to the driver
even though the components don't feel like they've cut corners or anything so yeah so that's the that's their tablet out of its box next up will be to give a go actually using it so
I'll I'll stop there and I'll start again when I've had to go with it right so I've been using the tablet for a little while to give it a good once-over and make sure that the initial feel of the thing was how it feels
after a little
you know you just install the drivers download them from the website and then you just either plug the USB cable directly into your computer or plug in the little Wi-Fi dongle and either way it works just no problems at all so that was good
I'm using it
so you don't have quite as many options for brush settings and things you do in the full version of Photoshop but it was enough to test because it gives you the the kind of the pressure apart they the pressure sensitivity and everything on different kinds of brushes and yeah so the the size of the of the tablet itself was was
it's quite nice
it's quite surprised
actually how its
I guess the extra definition that you can get out of the larger area and after using it for half an hour always you know that comfortable using it as as normal it was just initial the initial kind of world was quite big
you know a wireless tablet might introduce some extra latency there but it seemed didn't seem to have any effect which is fantastic the the pen felt - as I was saying the extra
the bump means you
a couple of bad points the wind it when it's in Wireless mode it will go to sleep quite quickly which is a little bit annoying because I'll tend to be doing a little bit of work and then I might jump back into 3dsmax or into unity and then if I'm away from the tablet but if I'm if I'm not drawing flight I think it feels like maybe 10 minutes or something it goes to sleep and they'll just wake it up
that's only when it's in Wireless when it's when it's connected it stays awake so that's good but that's a little bit annoying that using the tablet didn't wake up
I was kind of expecting you know you draw a little bit in a wake up again but that doesn't seem to so you can actually just take it on and off but it's only you take it off on two seconds later it's connected and you can use it again so that's fine the I couldn't test the tilt the tilt setting now the the website and the the Amazon listing says that it's got the tilt control the version of after I saw Riel Photoshop Elements doesn't have the option to to try that so I wasn't able to test it
I might take it into work and trying the tablet on proper Photoshop just to see what the tail was like so I can't really give any impressions of that and also there's no rotate detection
the quality is you know the bit the build quality is really good no problems with the drivers as I said before some some people have issues with the drivers on the on the huion tablets
I was drawing with it for a while just sketching and then colouring in and the when I when I'm coloring and doing the shading I flicked between having either a fixed size brush or using the shape dynamics and with the shape dynamics it was you know just the kind of sensitivity that have come to expect from using the using a Wacom so that was you know
there it was
I'm really happy with it all I'll think about doing a an update later on once I've use once I've used the tablet for months I guess and let people know if you know how it's worked over time if this obviously if there's been any mechanical problems with it then I'll I'll come back and I'll report about those but fingers crossed it'll be fine
yes so there is
that's my review
so that's that's always kind of reassuring when you open it up and it's like it's this is solid that's good the build quality of the pen and the accessories and the table itself
that's great
it's got all of the functioning and and of the same level that you'd expect from a Wacom so that's good and then the value for money is obviously a really important one
considering is a around a third of the price of an in to us and it feels like it's probably trying to aim at the same part of the market is into us so yeah for being a third of the price they've made a pre-competitive product there
who are you
want kind of interested in using a screen tablet might be like yeah well rather than spending however many hundreds is on you know multiple multiple hundreds on the the
a hundred pound
turbo is 110 pounds

this is a detachable so you can pull the screen off here and get yourself a tablet or of course you can attach it to here and use it the way you would use a laptop you also have some other modes where you can flip the screen around here and kind of use it in a special display mode as well so you can use it as a media player or even go into a tent mode with it also
RAM and not a lot of storage but a good basic transportation and again in line with what we've seen in other areas of this market space and we have an 11 inch screen like all the other ones - 1366 by 768 this is a TN panel not an IPS but the viewing angles on
cheap and detachable
do travel time here
click on this side
of course you get the right-click but if you hit it too far in the middle you kind of hit the divider between those two clicks and nothing happens there
I am not complaining about that at all what I do like too is that they have a full size USB port on the side here so you can plug in a full size USB keyboard or hub if you have those things laying around you also have an HDMI connector here too so you can plug it into an external display and kind of use it as a desktop what
I don't like though are some of the button placements so there is a Windows button here for pulling up your Start menu but I'm finding I'm hitting that by accident too often when I'm in tablet mode it would have liked it to have been maybe up here or something like it isn't many other devices so that's a one one little gadget there
also so you might hit that one by accident occasionally you also have a headphone microphone jack here and OTG port so this is a micro USB connector but you can plug in one of those adapters that you can get for two or three bucks on Amazon or somewhere else
there's also a micro SD card slot here so you can plug in a card to augment its on-board storage which can be pretty helpful too so you can expand your storage by popping in an SD card
this doesn't you know
there won't delete anything
but you certainly don't want to reset your tablet in the middle of downloading something or installing software or something like that and that will just hit the reset button essentially so kind of an odd button choice there
so here we go
Bay Trail powered devices so the videos come up relatively quickly and things are rendering in pretty quick on screen here too so it feels about where I'd expect it to feel decent browsing experience for sure
I will take a look now also at a 1080p 60 video here so I will get a feel for some higher-end video quality and it feels like it's running
pretty nicely actually
no dropped frames here
a very smooth playback
we got a score of six thousand four hundred and seventy-six so it really puts it in line with what we've seen with other Bay Trail devices including the more expensive HP Pavilion x2
so you're going to get good performance out of this thing again in line with other computers running the same chips you're also going to see very similar performance with word processing also in other kinds of office tasks so we have our Microsoft Word here running with our newsletter template
it is able to do a lot of the functions that we've seen on other computers just as well and it's great for office tasks and all the basics that you might throw at it tablets like this are not gaming powerhouses but they can run some games pretty decently like Minecraft here this is the original version of Minecraft not the Windows 10 version we have a little plug-in called Optifine on here to improve its performance
but we're getting around 30 frames per second or so give or take which is good and again in line what we've seen on other devices like this and on the 3d mark cloud gate test we get a score of 1145 and this is a good test to see how it might stack up with more modern games and the answer to that question is not very well but no machine at this price point with the chips that are in here are going to perform very well with modern
so you're going to be able to do things like Minecraft here that's going to work just fine but other stuff like Grand Theft Auto and fallout and everything else
that's hot out
at all in fact you probably not going to be able to fit those games on here either because you don't have a lot of onboard storage to support those games either but you can do
I've seen on a lot of other department store tablets at around this price point so that is a good thing that they are willing to stand behind the product for more than just 90 days
so if you do have a problem you know maybe a couple months into it there will be some recourse that you can take to get the product repaired and it is the RCA brand name so I think there is some brand equity there also so I think it's probably a safe bet if you were to buy it from there usually targets also pretty good about customer service too so that is the $200 cambio from RCA a detachable for about 200 bucks and it actually feels pretty nice
it's about 2.8
the weight sheds so you're looking at about a pound or so with just the screen and about the same with the keyboard dock separately so not too heavy to carry around in tablet mode a pretty decent device for the price and performance about where you'd expect a $200 PC to perform with a decent warranty as compared to its competition
I absolutely hate about it so I let them know that I was gonna be honest about it and they were fine with that and they sent it along to me so here it is
let's let's unbox this
alright let's see it
it's really really light
it's packaged really
that's pretty cool
you know my $3,000
let's see do customer
these are super useful
it feels nice
it feels comfortable
I noticed pen
buttons are are clicky
they feel like they'd be very easy to press accidentally but yeah on first glance yeah pretty decent pen and the fact that you don't have to charge it is pretty awesome uh-huh
just feel really nice
uh you just got to pop this part out with a little bit of force and then it comes out like so and then sets up like that beautiful and then our tablet again
I like how I'm lightweight it is it's not self-contained you still have to connect it to a computer so it's not like a self-contained tablet you still have to lug around like a laptop or something with a HDMI port on it
so if we look at our big monster three-way cable here we have an HDMI port here so I'm gonna plug that into my laptop over here oh I see so I can either plug two USBs into the computer one of them being the power to the thing or I can plug the red USB into the power outlet okay well
I've got two USBs so I think I'll just plug them into the USB port here like so and then I connect this little guy into the tablet which looks like it connects that that seems to be very unstable
that's almost twelve inches
it's 11 point something
it's one of those things where they put out like these really high numbers but actually it doesn't mean anything so don't use that as a reason to buy a tablet or not but anyways it says it has 8000 levels
we'll try it out
Wacom pens have so
I said earlier
it looks really nice
we've got a logo
oh hey look
so it's moving
it's following my cursor
let's test the corners
I've used off-brand tablets for a long time and just got used to not using an eraser on the end of my pen and I would just use it as a tool
looks really nice
the colors are okay
a lot of them include drivers that are just really bare-bones and you can't really customize very much it sounds like with this tablet you'll be able to do a lot more with the driver
what a pain
this thing is awesome
so if you go down into your taskbar there will be this little icon here which you can double click on and that'll bring up our tablet driver so messing around with the driver
click middle click switch between pen and eraser run a program or a function key so if I click on function key C it looks like I can do middle
click double click left
so that's a thing where it like zooms in and it makes your cursor really slow so you can work in really fine detail oh it's got B /e which is default brush slash eraser on most programs
klk are mode switch
let's find out ok
that's kind of cool
so with the klk
it's like clicky
Wacom tablet so continuing if I press that button again now it's on brush size so I can draw with a huge fat rush and I can wheel down and draw with a really tiny detailed brush
that's pretty neat
yeah so far
we'll keep that right
click for now
what does that do
now it's just mirroring my monitor display you can use this as a second monitor so if I use Windows and P you'll see my options to extend display come up or duplicate display or just have one of them display
I can do is back on my laptop is I can click a window and drag it over and bring it on to my drawing tablet so I can do the same with clip studio paint here
let's see so
I'm using my my laptop mouse right now to move around okay so I just pressed okay on the tablet driver and that seemed to UM bring back my my pen again so now
so let's set it all the way to soft and if I draw with it so I'm not pressing very hard at all and it's already making a pretty fat line and on the reverse if I set it to hard
I'm not pressing hardly at all and it's doing a very thin line if I press with a lot of effort it's not even getting close to 50% of how big my brush is so I would probably set that just on zero
this is useful
it's windows ink
there's no one answer
it depends on the program so if I turn it on and draw again it obviously doesn't matter in this program but I know if you're like drawing in browsers and stuff like that
so that's pretty useful
so that's undo cool
one it's brush so anytime you want to go back to your brush and then the last one by default is that klk our switch mode that we were talking about so pressing it switches from zoom in and out then pressing it again now
no oh
I assume means whether you're rotating it left or rotating it right so here under the dial settings you can customize it so you don't have to stick with the control + control - scroll and then the brush you can add other actions - looks like the only options you have are scroll or keyboard so you can do different keyboard outputs that could be useful like if you're animating you can have turn it right
go back a frame
I'm very impressed
Wacom drivers really have yeah that's awesome and I like the shortcut keys that it has by default to zoom in and out works really well in some programs you could rotate your canvas so that might be a useful thing to have setup on here drawing on it feels pretty nice does feel a little bit gummy like I noticed like little parts where the pen kind of sticks to it
yeah no complaints about the the parallax any leg like generally depends on the computer rather than the tablet but drawing on it and this is an old laptop too like this thing is not made to be a drawing computer and
this thing's awesome would
I would recommend this
100% the only downside
does this stay on
no okay so yeah
Tilt works so if I draw with my pen at the side I can sort of do shading that way and then if I want more detailed line I just uh hold it more straight up and down so can confirm the tilt works if it's at too much of a tilt like I'm holding it pretty much 180 degrees it's not registering
yeah that's pretty cool
so that's awesome
that's really cool
this tablet's awesome
i 100% recommend it
it turned on fine
installation was easy
the drivers are awesome
it's pretty light
I wouldn't really complain
there would not recommend but you know if if you feel your pen nibs starting to scratch up the screen you can always replace it with another one of the eight pen nibs that they give you so in summary
the pen doesn't need any batteries or any charging the drivers that came with were really awesome and super customizable as far as some of the cons about the tablet
not too bad
take it easy buh-bye
That's coming up next.
Let's start by going in-depth into the screen. It's a very large screen at 21.5 inches, so you'll have plenty of room to gesture, and best of all, there's no bezel to interrupt your brush strokes.
One downside to the bezel-free design is that when you draw brush strokes near the bezel, they bounce off of the edge of the bezel, creating a line that goes back onto your canvas.
As you can see, when I switch between calibrated and uncalibrated view, this display can benefit from color calibration. According to Parblo's website, this device measures around 82% NTSC and 114% sRGB.
The pen does feel a little unbalanced because of the battery on the end, which makes it heavier on the back end, and the rubber grip doesn't feel as soft as Wacom's pen or some of the other alternatives that I've tried.
22 is very smooth.
Lines taper nicely.
As far as line quality is concerned, the lines are a little bit jittery and wavy, even if you use a straight edge. It was especially noticeable in Krita, where it was really jittery.
That does put it on the heavier side, as far as display tablets are concerned, but again, the metal build quality feels very durable, so I think that's a fair trade-off. In regards to the cables, this tablet uses individual cables rather than a nice, tidy all-in-one cable.
There are some buttons
on the bottom edge of the tablet that can power the tablet on and off and adjust the color temperature, backlight, brightness, contrast, and sharpness, but they're a little bit difficult to reach where they're located.
Unfortunately, there is not a convenient control panel to adjust the screen settings, so you have to use these buttons on the outside of the tablet, which I find difficult to navigate.
so that your application
Included with the Mast
It does look like the stand could be removed and possibly you could connect a VESA adapter using the mounting holes for the included stand, but I don't know for sure because I didn't remove the stand.

a lot of tablet based information that's going to be useful to you so subscribe to brett and like his videos so in that video i talked about using the artist pad and the pen tool to turn your screen
uh transparent so that you can take notes while you're looking at whatever it is that they are showing on the zoom or in your zoom meeting or your video conference meeting you can do a couple different levels of transparency here all the way through and then back to completely opaque so
i have an iphone 12 pro and i'm using an app on there to record this video now that i use almost the exact same process to do video conferencing and what i do is i install something a little program called
droid cam droid cam
droid cam client
this link is also inside of the droid cam app on ios and i'm not sure if they have an android version or not i would assume with the name
this works with skype
it works with teams
i'm using to hold my phone and have that take a quality video of my face at a decent angle as opposed to up my nostrils and can do my meeting that way that way
i don't know okay so here we're going to make this full screen and we're having a zoom meeting and i have the artist pad up here and i can see what he's doing
if this is on a desk or somewhere else i can actually look directly into the camera here in front and have a normal conversation at correct angles while using just my surface pro or whatever device you're using at the angle that's most comfortable here and not worry about the angle
i use obs camera or i use droid cam which is a wireless solution um quality slightly down but it does a good job for this type of thing does a really good job
Wacom and today I'm gonna be reviewing this device was provided to be by the folks over at law calm but this is not a sponsored video so the opinions contained herein are my own
so what is this
what's new here well
Pro Wacom has always done these high-end pen displays they specialize in producing the best of the best the quality and the features they're going for are usually cut above the rest so over the last couple years
the resolution on the Cintiq 16 is 1920 by 1080 that's full HD the pro however is 4k that's 3840 pixels by 2160 pixels so the pro has twice as many pixels
that's underneath it since there is more space here what you're seeing is in effect that many people refer to as parallax that is the space between where your pen is and where the cursor appears on the screen and that is one of the really big benefits of jumping up to the pro line over something like this also the texture they put on
I've used it on the newest into host tablets and it's kind of hard to put into words how good the pen feels and how I feel about this I really like it I think
I do put it through a bunch of tests to kind of get a feel for what it's doing and how that pen behaves when you're drawing with it and this really works flawlessly as soon as I put it down on the screen
it's all there
and then what I could do is I can use really light pressure to go in there and fill in some of the really narrows tighter spaces and that's a little thing and I think a lot of other drawing tablets do that fairly well but this just feels good it responds exactly the way
there's less space
I'm not saying it's super hard to line up your lines when you're doing pen lines and trying to do that but it was definitely more noticeable here than it was on the pros
but it's small enough that you can slide it out of the way when you're not using it having a big 22 inch or 24 inch display is really cool
NTSC the pros are listed in Adobe RGB and since the screen does have a matte finish which makes it really nice to draw on that does manage to dull the color a little bit a lot of laptops and monitors you get now have a glossy screen because it makes the blacks blacker and the whites whiter personally
I would much rather draw on a screen like this but that really comes down to preference and I think a lot of illustrators who really need that kind of color
I recently got a computer that has a USB C connection so I like only having to have one cord instead of a separate HDMI and USB cable but really it doesn't make that big a difference the one thing
Wacom has been facing these out on some of the Cintiq for a while now and replacing them with the remote now the larger Cintiq pros come with this remote at least my Cintiq pro 24 came with this remote the Cintiq 16 does not come with the remote so out of the box
just not the remote
pull out tab
Wacom has managed to smooth those out and improve those drivers over time and this device is using the same exact driver that my Cintiq Pro is using so for me
and how you go in and customize things like where your shortcut keys are or what the pen pressure is that sort of thing every tablet does this but I think Wacom does it best
this is still more expensive than some of the other displays out there and also you're gonna have to pay extra for the stand and the Express key remote if you want those things
I'd also throw out there that if you're using an older Cintiq and looking to upgrade this might not feel like a big step forward like it would if you were jumping to one of the pros it's probably gonna feel like a sideways move overall
I think it's great that Wacom is releasing a less expensive version of their tzitzit pros which have always been very pricy and since there are so many the brands out there and those brands have been getting better and better over time
it really does make sense for welcome to scale it down a little bit and release something at a lower price range where he can still get that level of quality where you need it anyway
I have for today
also i apologize if my voice is a little raspy my throat's really dry and i keep drinking water to make it not dry but yeah my voice feels a little weird today
you get many things like a glove you also get a cleaning cloth and the cables to plug the tablet to your computer when i review tablets like these a lot of people ask if they need a computer and yes they do
the stand comes in two pieces that you can put together and on the bottom of the stand there is a nib remover to help take the nib out of the pen
uh so i keep
he saw his flirty and gets flustered or surprised when the person he's trying to flirt with actually flirts back so let's start drawing hisao so this illustration isn't going to be very complicated
being in the correct spot i did notice that around the edges of the tablet the cursor does like to move away from the pen and it can be kind of hard to click on what you want if it's around the edges like there were multiple times
the current tablet
where around the edges
the pen cursor will misalign a little bit however because the vk 1200 is smaller any variation in relation between the pen and the cursor is kind of more prominent than when working on larger displays
and many of you want to see me use it more i also want to use it more before this illustration i decided to use more of my normal work and coloring process
since i was testing out this tablet i wanted to be able to focus on the tablet and how it felt and not get wrapped up in the creation process too much however i did try to incorporate some new things i did learn in the digital painting video especially for the hair for this illustration i tried to make it more detailed and close to the hair shading style i used in the digital painting video
and then lastly i went in with my stronger highlights to make the hair look really shiny later on i do add some more highlights and i also add some stray hairs
for the tablet
there are some other tablets with a screen similar to this one for the same price however the vik is much smaller and it doesn't have a bunch of space around the screen
5 stars is because it does not come with a stand or power adapter also the pen misalignment around the edges is pretty noticeable however it is a nice little tablet and it does get the job done
if a tablet being small and not bulky is important to you you may enjoy this tablet so that is all i have to say about the veekvk 1200 and here is my finished piece of hisao thank you so much fluffy ramen for submitting your character
this is the
Intuos it's a thin
what's the difference
where are my note
that's drawing
Roundy's that hold it in place the medium comes with bluetooth so you can use it wirelessly or plug it in using the USB cord it comes with if you get the small you have the option of whether you want to pay for the Bluetooth or whether you just want to use it as a USB tablet if you choose to go wired you're gonna save yourself twenty bucks the battery on the Bluetooth models charges when you plug it in using the USB cable now I haven't been doing heavy use with it and I have been plugging it into different computers but I am finding that
and that is the feel of these drawing tablets like what does the pen feel like when you actually place it down and draw on the surface of the tablet
that's marketing speak for
it's very smooth
diagonal line test
looks good
what's that you want
spare nibs we
I prefer the pro pen couple of tips if this is your first time ever using something like this I would recommend actually using it for a couple days or a couple weeks to get used to it
move it directly in front of the screen that you're drawing out that's gonna help you out in terms of getting used to looking at the screen and drawing at the same time now
I've got a link down in the description but on a lot of those it seems like the settings are just an afterthought I get a feeling that Wacom has really thought through the user experience a little bit more for example
at the same time
I just want to map to this screen while I'm using this right now but and Wacom settings what they've done is they've let you set it to a program so I can set it to Photoshop and when I click on Photoshop now I have just mapped to one screen as soon as I tap Photoshop with that pen now I have mapped to two screens and it's completely customizable so I can do this with illustrator
that's pretty cool
Wacom did update the drivers about halfway through the review and seemed to clear up some of those things none of them were show stoppers for example when I opened up Adobe animate and I went to the pressure settings it just didn't exist
I couldn't find it
the small without bluetooth
that thing is phenomenal
I've been using it in Photoshop and illustrator and flash or Adobe animate over the last couple days but pretty much any software that you download and want to use for animation drawing or 3d programs
it's gonna work with that so if you've been looking to dip your toe into digital art for the first time this might be a good place to start if you have any comments or questions
I've got for now
it's so cool
wow it's super awesome
look it is speed

wow guys
wow let me

i see something pink
wow it's a cover
i mean assistant
and also here
fight too guys now
TV shows and cartoons providing good detail for text and books reading was not tiring with a sharp image the Amazon Fire HD 10 kids edition comes with a media tech 1.8 gigahertz quad-core processor and 2 gigabytes of RAM
life is about 10 hours long being a fairly decent amount of time however charging takes a little more time about five hours to top it up fully with the best on the market parental controls that give you access to control every individual app providing you with a deeper insight into how your children use the tablet
but not horrible
either one thing
I do like that
it gives it give it a better quality field in the plastic enos of the Augie and genta so as I said it's a 7-inch resistive touch Android 2.1 tablet
let's go over
first this is
headphone two mini USB
and your power
your power jack
they did work
I find very annoying
the power is sometimes you have to kind of press to get and they're on the back of the device so they don't make a whole lot of sense easily to use when you are you know using the device because they are in the back the nice thing is the
Augen gen touch this
which score between 500 to 2200 the the Samsung Galaxy Tab scores anywhere between 900 and 2000 the G tablets by viewsonic scores up in the to 1900 to 2000 range
UI on it
I think they kind of left that button in thinking there may be cameras because the box actually does show a hole where there seems to be a camera but there is not one there is no accelerometer on this device
UI weather calendar clock
I reader for books
you actually go to digital digital gadgets comm for this device they kind of resell it or the one to resell it for sylvain under the Sylvania name and they do say on their page of be updates
I have no internal memory available so I cannot install any apps so there's definitely some some issues here with their version of Android that they're you know they have on this device it all
so pretty much every reboot that I do is a total reset of the device that does not say my settings or memory so there are some issues that hopefully digital gadgets will work out for this device especially this device right now you can get at Sears and Kmart for 179
is it worth it
Android out here
I was not able to try out any games yet so I'm unsure of what capabilities are there the Augen gen touch was about you know was able to play games
there's a music section also and then obviously to enter email on here so this is the Sylvania seven-inch mini tablet like I said it will be probably for Black Friday for 139 at Toys R Us it's an Android 2.1 device not a very speedy device
I don't really expect that but you do get somewhat a decent as long as it doesn't have the issues that I'm having if you have a working a working firm wire here
I have on it
I hope a hope
I'll write with it
no use
you got a steering wheel all this work and everything worked and you got the mold and now the mold is gonna change as you see the blue to work but the mode is gonna change mode between up here on the top so if I hit mode right now I'm on Bluetooth and I hit mo of this power sensor so when I hear mo just gonna go to office and then here mode again
radio hit mode again
I like the tablet
I love this tablet
a man is hard
it does everything
you can control it from here play you've got a Bluetooth then it got these controls where you can dial the number or whatever you want to do and make a phone call you got a recent
I'm not sure okay
it's gonna disconnect whatever you connect it to if you go to here right here gonna bring up the equalizer got bass rid of trouble and they got the Hertz or whatnot you go down here and you can fade it from left to right up and down and you got a loudness
you know it kind of do it on his own depending on the time and day or whatever like right now it was nice so date the day and gonna do nothing because it's nighttime of course so system said it's a lot of technical stuff y'all not gonna really understand this but basically saying they got a touch tone to it and see guidelines the navigation front camera this
this is off
mine's just didn't come with heated seats or dual the door like my dual is not gonna work because I don't have dual that like it's not a premium so it's a track performance package
so that does work
you can change this
I will make a part two of y'all want me to but I'll show you how to change the whole layout of the whole thing and but that's good right there for Bluetooth we're gonna go to okay now
it came with it
it's a little
well phone link
okay first enter
Pablo's navigation that's with which navigation you want to use I currently got set the Google Maps but and when I come with it is the I go and that won't work without Wi-Fi the mat so you have to have Wi-Fi you see GPS monitor
come with its own
you can upgrade it
whatever update the vehicle
they gave my password
everything will look different
got radios on you
ya see what
now let's see
I want to make sure everything does work via trending my vid got Wi-Fi in it so we got the vit running so we're gonna hear it hook up the dead Wi-Fi if you press the home button right here it's gonna bring you back to the launcher
my door is open
I'm opposed boom
they go away
open the passenger door
sign into your account
okay that's cool
I don't want to
I'm good
don't counsel counsel
McMeel don't drop song
I got advertisements
I am monetize
I'm not my area is kind of bad especially what kind of Wi-Fi but I just want to show you how to work now watching a video so you can do that with anything
netflix yada yada
that's night night
press it again
just mute button
I'm not 100% sure
it's gonna load up
Google Maps but like I said you gotta have Wi-Fi to use Google Maps you don't have to have Wi-Fi to use their system it's called I go something let's see is there anything goes to cover
let's put it
because that's what comes with it but this right here shows you everything they use as far as you know the AC and all the hidden stuff everything so you got an IB
I ain't got no complaints about it only thing I would say is the Bluetooth now sometimes from time to time the Bluetooth like okay if your bluetooth connect disconnect it's gonna be an issue trying to reconnect like me
I want to know more about my Mustang man emu or watch some of my videos Savas Beatie V where we do savage speed stuff and had a Mustang and a bit over there and that will complete the review for the tablet
hi this is
I'll also be testing
I will leave a link to my Instagram in the video description just a little disclaimer before I start my review I was sent this tablet by Aliexpress to do a review and speed painting on that being said this review is based on my experience with the tablet and is a hundred percent my honest review
I'm working on
felt the tablet
the tablet can be pretty big but the tablet drawing area is much smaller and there's a lot of empty space that doesn't make sense but with this tablet it's the entire thing the pressure sensitivity on
so you don't have cords everywhere and really you can just use the cord to charge the tablet for those of us who don't really read the manual before starting use their products
what's going on
I'll leave a link in the description below if you want to check it out there now that I've gone through my thoughts about the pros we're gonna go to the cons
I have a few issues with the pin one being it's very rigid and there's no grip on it so if you're drawing for a long time it's gonna get a little uncomfortable after a while and you can't really put a grip on it since there's buttons that you have to access on the pin there's also no eraser end on the pin
what's really this is just a personal preference but the tablet that I normally use does have an eraser side where you can flip the pin over and erase and then flip back but really
my current tablet
I thought was a con next is I guess another personal preference but my current tablet has something called a touch ring where I can easily change my brush size or zoom in and out by moving my finger around this ring it makes things very easy and my workflow really depends on that touch ring and I started working with the tablet and I realized I didn't have one so I was kind of like whoa what do I do and I had to
I've been working with the same tablet for over four years now and I've gotten so used to the button setup and especially the touch ring that without the feature that I find so integral to my process I found it difficult to use this tablet
if you want to see more art related videos like this one thank you - who Yan and Aliexpress for sponsoring this review as well as all of my wonderful supporters on patreon
hey what does happen
Windows tablet it's got an 11.6 inch 1080p IPS panel 64 gigabytes of built-in storage 6 gigabytes of RAM and the trusty Intel Celeron and 3450 which is pretty decent
it's got a pretty good battery life for a Windows tablet and some stuff that we're gonna be talking about in just a bit so first of all this box that it comes in
it's nothing special
which inside you'll find
maybe once in the lifetime is talat into the back you'll also get some protectors some film projectors they can take off which are nice and keeping this tablet nice and clean
and here's where you'll find the jumper logo and the Intel Inside logo and two notches on both ends to open up the angle adjustment panel so here are the annual adjustments they can do and these are the two main ones right here and then it close it up and of course you can go in between but you just have to kind of adjust it yourself and get it at the right position now the American extension
it's actually pretty good
and if you have a tablet placed at an eye level then you can also go for the first adjustment which will narrow the angle for you which is pretty good now inside
Evo and this closes up just like so pretty simple and straightforward and it does seem like they had an idea of actually adding some kind of SIM card or another SD card
now something that you will notice here is that the casing is actually cracked around these edges and this is a pretty weak point in fact you can actually lift this and almost just break it off completely but moving
now let's go ahead and quickly take a look at the optional keyboard cover which has a touchpad first of all is go ahead and take apart this scratch pad protector and here is what it looks like so at a glance it has pretty much everything that you'd need it's got many keys on the top including brightness and volume controls we get a pretty decent arrow key and a quick touchpad
acrobatics the keys
and there you go
you're in tablet mode and if you want you can actually push this up and get some elevation get an angle at this keyboard and start working with it and that'll go ahead and move on to these software starting with these storage speeds of the emmc storage and the SD card slot so on the Left we have the EMG storage 64 gigabytes in total
it could be better
but that's that so
you get what you get for what it is it's not an SSD it's an MMC and then moving on to the right side with the SD card slot it's nothing to be surprised about it is running at USB 2.0 speeds and I have yet to actually see a USB 3.0 card reader on one of these tablets
and not only that
these are the speeds that you can expect from this laptop being in the same room as the Wi-Fi network and a quick look at the RAM in the task manager
at 1600 megahertz
now all
I would be showing you some online gaming and showing you a couple games here and there but unfortunately I simply cannot launch and run some of the games to play online because steam is offline and steam is offline because the Wi-Fi is not connecting
Steam and it seems like it's working it and the reason I think the Wi-Fi is starting to mess up is probably because I'm running off the USB and my guess is that the USB power is being chaired by the Wi-Fi module let's just go ahead and run a game and see what happens if it disconnects once again so I was going to do the stew with 24 players online
just simply forget it
Wi-Fi has disconnected again
let's see if my guess is right if you go ahead and disconnect all the USB devices so I'm running the OTG for the mouse and a small SD on the full sized and it seems like it's coming back okay so I'm gonna sing some what right
USB ports the Wi-Fi will actually start having issues and again my guess is that the USB is here are actually sharing the power with the Wi-Fi module which is pretty stupid and on top of that the Wi-Fi is already 2.4 gigahertz so it doesn't help that you get no Wi-Fi - so let's go ahead and take a listen and see what the speakers sound like you all right
in my opinion
now does it work
I can definitely enjoy a stylus pen like this even though it doesn't have any pressure sensitivity but overall it's very responsive in that regard but that doesn't help the tablet here because there are a few of all the flaws that we're gonna be talking about so the conclusion here what do I think about this tablet
well first
it's pretty big
the speaker's here are front-facing speakers and they do sound pretty okay and decent but they do leave some stuff to be desired when it comes to volume the selection of ports that we have here is not very generous
it's actually pretty small
all we really have is an OTG port a headphone jack a micro HDMI and a full sized USB port that is already cracked at box charging options are very limited
this tablet is through this port right here which is not very convenient and speaking of limited ports it seems like when we connect some useful devices like my SSD right here or anything for that matter like a mouse it seems like it actually affects the Wi-Fi and it disconnects and it disconnects the Wi-Fi and we end up with no internet it's bigger than Internet
it's actually quite disappointing
it's pretty ok
it's not that bad
it performs like it expects it's got a pretty decent amount of RAM and really not a whole lot of storage but that's ok since you have an SD card slot even though it's USB 2.0
but that is a given for multiple tablets out there and lastly when it comes to heat this tablet does get warm even though it is pretty chunky and it would expect it not to have that much it does get pretty warm on the front and the back when you play games and that is that now something
it's a local file
being played off a tablet and we get 4 hours and 20 minutes training time takes about two and a half hours which is standard for these kind of tablets and with that the conclusion should
what do recommend instead of this well surprisingly the Chewie sir Brook Mini not the full size surberg but the servic mini and that is because the sorbic mini has a smaller display but most importantly it is running a 1080p display if he has no Chewie likes to put really high resolution displays on their tablets and it pretty much hinders and kills all performance
CPUs that they like to put on their tablets and laptops that one else that has a USB type-c they can charge with it has more ports that it's overall a much better tablet
Wi-Fi and a whole lot of things that this tablet has issues with either way the last time I checked the price on this for Berkman II is much better considering what you get and one last thing before we go the keyboard here and definitely no recommended if you still want to get the tablet and that is because of the simple key right here when you press this key it will simply lock your tablet so if you are working and you accidentally press this key right here then your tablet will simply shut off and lock itself or go into sleep mode and that's probably gonna get very frustrating really quickly if you end up doing that very often and the touchpad here is actually not that responsive it has a bunch of gestures that get in the way you can't really tap and drag at the same time it's you gotta stop and then drag
it is simply full of problems and the only thing they're gonna be enjoying out of this keyboard is the keyboard part except for this part and this part because because these things right here are gonna simply get in the way of your experience and yeah that is actually pretty much for this video
so thank you for watching hope you have enjoyed and found helpful if you did hit the like button and subscribe cause like this and I'll see you guys in the next one check everyone
This is the Dash
For this display
We have the Epson m30 receipt printer and the Datalogic Heron barcode scanner, along with just your standard black metal cash drawer, and you can see it looks like a pretty nice all-in-one point of sale station right here, but it does a little more than your normal point-of-sale station, mainly is that it's a tablet, so that you can release it from the base, and take it with you if you need to line bust, or do some inventory, then you also have a tablet.
This allows the tablet to go from facing you to facing the customer, so it flips down, so if you're going to be doing imager capture, signature capture, or you need to show them something on the screen, like a warranty form or something like that, then you can flip it to customer facing, and then you can go upright.
that tightens down.
Overall price point of the Dash is going to be above 1000 dollars, it's closer to an all-in-one price than like a consumer tablet price, but you are getting a all-in-one tablet kind of in a one bundle.
22 inch second generation
my problem is now
i have two drawing tablets but i only have one drawing hand so i figured i might as well put my money where my mouth is again because if you remember last year i gave away one of those the first generation in this video
so first
we're going to take a look at the build quality we're going to take a look at the connections and then we're going to take a look at the stylus and then when we take a look on the inside what we're going to do is take a look at the pressure sensitivity and we'll take a little bit of a deep dive into the drivers that run this thing
that's one of the things that xp pen does very well some of the extra things that you get when you buy one of these devices we'll take a look at that stuff too
another thing that you get when you order a xp pen is this little cover here so you can run the cables through these little clips here to contain them
and then when you click this into place everything is nice and neat and it actually protects the connection because if this cable is flopping back and forth like this all the connections in here can get loose and you don't really want that okay
so that's the outside
obviously you get the owner's manuals and you get this really cool two finger drawing glove and you always see me wearing mine on this channel and the reason is when you're drawing on something warm not that this gets warm at all but sometimes in my office it gets warm and so if i'm drawing and my hand gets a little moist it sticks to the screen a little bit so i'm able with this glove
i'm able to come in here and draw and i don't have to worry about my hands sticking because of moisture or anything so now let's talk about styluses and this is the xp pen stylus if you remember in the first generation of the xp pen drawing tablets their styluses were battery operated so they would send you two and then a cable that you were able to then plug into the back or the top of the pen and then that would charge and you would have one charging while you're drawing with the other one
that doesn't happen anymore
um just because if you are constantly drawing you don't want to be in the middle of a drawing and then your stylus runs out of batteries and then god forbid that you go to find your other stylus and that one is missing so now you have to take a break you have to plug in your stylus and you have to charge it all that stuff
there's just a little more flare on the wacom one but the feel of it is the feel of the xp pen is a lot better now so the nib of the xp pen is made out of hard plastic the nib for the wacom
so what they do is they give you all of these really cool things that help sweeten the pot and this is by far one of my favorite things that they have come out with
is you can set this on the table while you're working and you can use it as a stylus holder and then when you go back to needing to draw you can just pick it up and you're off and running this container also houses if we undo the other side it has eight nibs in there and that little hole is the nib remover
is you take your stylus and you put the nib in that hole and then you tilt it just a little and you see how easy it is to get that nib pulled out there we go and then you just grab one of the other nibs and you slide it into the stylus and you're back in business and now let's take a look at the drivers because this is one of the biggest improvements that xp pen has done when they came out with the generation
one you'd go into the system preferences of your computer and you had like maybe two things that you could adjust one was the pressure sensitivity and two was what you could do with the rocker buttons here
now they have this whole interface and they have it broken down into a couple different panels the work area and you can take a look at the screen and do all kinds of you can calibrate here
let's drop down to pen settings you can actually set your rocker buttons to do different things depending on what application you're in and that's where you would uh add here
i just i like my stuff to just work and so i don't really mess with this all that much but here you can change the hardness like if you're a really hard drawer maybe you want to go towards the hard end and softer drawers can go over to the soft
i'm going to go ahead and leave that right in the middle and then if you make a bunch of adjustments to your stylus you click ok and it'll save your changes and now everything is incredibly custom so now that we have taken a look at the outside
oh before we go now that i have this open if you have an xp pen this is the driver and the driver needs to be running in order for you to be able to draw and use the tablet the way that you're trying to use it right by default this does not run and it does not run automatically
so what i suggest you do is when you have the icon up or even if the pen tablet driver is running what you want to do is go to that icon for the software
so what's going to happen is that's going to be added to the list of applications that are launched when you restart your computer and that's what you want to do
it's already running
let's maybe draw see
is i have the top button as the undo so if i put down a stroke that i don't want if i do the undo it will take that stroke off but with the xp pen the way that it's set up now you see it turned into an eraser so i'm going to go ahead and erase that line
i'm pleased
let's go to sketchbook and see okay so sketchbook is really easy all you do is hit the space bar and you're you're getting a lot of the you know your rotation tools and your zoom tools
that drawing in photoshop is bad but i feel like i need to do a lot of adjusting to get it to go to get it to feel the way that i want it to go if that makes sense
but if i switch over to sketchbook and i draw in sketchbook it just makes more sense right now um like how hard i press and how light i press
i've liked the sketchbook drawing and painting brushes a little bit better than photoshop generally speaking anyway so now let's talk about quality because all of this is fine and good but if it doesn't feel good or if it if it gets in the way of your creativity no money is worth your creativity
now the xp pen straight out of the factory it's 600 bucks the quality and the price together and all of the really cool things and i'm telling you this thing here is my favorite
i'll do it live on instagram and possibly on youtube if i can figure how to do both of those otherwise i'll do it live either on instagram or youtube
i'll cover the shipping
how's that sound
who's looking to get into animation graphic design filmmaking any of this creative stuff please send this video on over to them and if you haven't yet please hit that subscribe button and if you notice there's a little bell right next to the subscribe button if you click on that
only much bigger
you do get the black slate design in full effect with glass on the front and plastic on the back and the sizable bezel around the 10-inch screen does make this look a little bit like a picture frame of sorts but I like to think that it's more like a small Sony TV because it does pack quite a bit of that power screen nuts might think the bezels are too much but in reality they really help with the handling of the device as you are able to grip the tablet easily on all sides by resting your thumb in that space and it truly makes a difference and makes the bezel more welcome than shunned and if you look closely on the sides of the screens lower third
that you'll ever see out there and slab is really the idea that I get here as you're going to wonder how something so compact in its thickness can provide so much power
jack is left on the lower panel while the top of the tablet houses an IR blaster along with a flap that gives access to microSD card slot and the micro USB charging ports and as you may already expect from Experion devices these days those flaps mean that this tablet is rated for water and dust resistance helping the z2 tablet brave the elements users of the previous Xperia tablet Z
will notice a better feel all around helped primarily by the fact that the skeleton has been smoothed out on the corners by the same plastic material comprises the back
it has a little more to it than the soft touch found on the likes of say the Nexus 7 but it retains its propensity to get smudged handling is basically what you would expect from a 10-inch tablet but perhaps it's at its best in sony's capable hands and that is because again
because there's a lot of real estate outside of the screen for you to rest your hand and then of course the actual thinness of the device provides a very nimble and light experience
I've been doing already in this review just because you can and it feels comfortable and easy to do the display of the Xperia z2 tablet gets the same change as its smartphone counterparts mainly they move to an IPS matrix that helped the Xperia z2 get even better display quality along with better viewing angles
LCD color gamut along with the triluminos and then the ex reality for media viewing basically all of this means that you get a display with very deep contrast and great color production resulting in an experience that is quite cinematic in nature and if I may say very much what you think Sony would interpret media viewing and though the pixel density might be lower than found on certain competitors
the reading experience here text is still very sharp and it's not hard to read at all so ultimately you'll be getting a lot of watching movies reading books or magazines and playing games on here and you'll have a great time doing any of those things which makes the z2 tablets
a great media consumption device and all of that fun is accomplished with the help of a great processing package the kind of which are probably already expecting the Snapdragon 801 clocked in at 2.3 gigahertz
however and when gaming
I saw no issues with pretty much any game that I played on here whether they were sprite based or 3d and multitasking takes on a pretty simplistic motif with the Xperia I and the recent apps button and perhaps with the small apps as well but the main takeaway here is that all of it works about as well as it should without any major hiccups
if you really need to watch that movie while enjoying a relaxing bath you can otherwise you can be as clumsy as you want to be with your beverages around this tablet and it will be fine now
that you're probably used to already including NFC which you have the marker right there and you can pretty much say that Sony is the master of NFC at this point because they like to integrate it into pretty much every device these days you can even set up your Xperia z2 with the tablet to make it a real companion even screen mirroring is possible though the future I would probably use the most is the built-in network tether an IR blaster allows you to control your TV with the tablet's remote control app and after that you get the general slew of connections though my version is Wi-Fi only the dual front-facing speakers on the tablet are very much like the ones found on the smartphone counterparts
the sound experience can be catered to your liking with quite a few enhancements built into the sound settings menu they can bring up the sheer loudness or just the clarity of the audio quality
I did like that
it's a bit of a shame but if you can get your own pair of those earbuds you'll get a wonderful audio experience that is very Sony like in quality battery
it's standby time
I did use this tablet for a little while before I went off to Beijing the other week and when I returned what I had originally left at 30 percent battery life still had 20% left after 5 days and I was able to pick up the tablet and continue doing what I was doing on
its five days before
I went with one of my classic battery life tests here putting on my media consumption hat and watching two episodes of Top Gear which got the battery life down from 90 percent to 72 percent which I thought was pretty good
you'll be able to watch a couple movies easily on here and still have more than half the battery life left over for browsing the web and getting any other tasks you need done now
because it's fairly obvious that you're not trying to buy a tablet solely for its camera capabilities and the lack of a flash diode somewhat tells the story of the camera experience as the optics are more of a required addition rather than a defining feature
I will come in Sony for trying to outfit the app with quite a few features that you will find in the smartphone like the background defocus or the AR effect but without the quality to back them up they're just novelties and ultimately not very useful at all and also the 8 megapixel optics are plagued by a similar issue that you find on Xperia smartphones
you already have in your pocket probably especially if it's the Xperia z2 the only application generally find for a tablet cameras is if you're just sitting back on your couch and you want to send a snapchat or share something
KitKat retains the rather simple home screen experience with the app drawer accessible from the top right allowing you a canvas that you can fill with icons and widgets galore
get into the app drawer and you'll find a quick pull over from the left that allows you a few shortcuts and some customization options as is the case with most tablet
themes as you can see here with the spider-man theme that was free as some of them you have to pay for and even though the background and a number of system areas are changed like the bar on the bottom and the bar on top the icons remain the same
so there's that and finally you have the different applications that Sony implanted into the tablet like the Walkman which is still one of my favorite looking local music players and I would use it all the time if my music wasn't already in the cloud the album and movies applications allow you a nice looking interface for your different pictures and videos and of course there is
Play Store once again
because this is a pretty premium device from the build quality down to the software experience maybe - that camera there are some competitors out there like the Samsung Galaxy Tab pro 10 which provides a largely similar experience but has a higher resolution and of course Samsung's own version of Android
Sony's own style and you think that perhaps Sony rocks Android a little bit better and then of course there is the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition but its main trump card is of course that s-pen if you really don't need a stylus experience or the multitasking that
but we're glad to see that they kept the best of the Xperia tablet Z and brought even more to offer in this second iteration as far as media consumption goes
you can't really get any better than this tablet right here especially if you put down the extra money for those noise cancelling headphones that are compatible with it and when you hold the power of a small

That’s what I got.
End of 2019
I have desk space.
I can sit.
I can stand.
And I do.
Nope. Not a problem.
It’s not going anywhere.
I’m curious though, if I don’t use a protector, how many years will I get out of the glass? I aim to find out on the 24 Pro. Unprotected penning. And hey, I can say a year later after daily use, yes, there are two small barely perceptible scratches. So yes. Order a screen protector.
Off and back on.
But you know what?
Agh! It’s so loud!
Pro is defunct.
Right side, check.
Left side, slippery slope.
So naturally that $100 piece of equipment, that express key remote that I love and realized I couldn’t live without until I lost it, slid off and took the three foot plunge to the carpet.
The tablet stopped recognizing my old remote too, except I have it tethered with the USB charger like this and I put some painter’s tape to keep it from sliding too much.
That remote didn’t fall.
Why does it suddenly stop being recognized in the middle of animating, no matter how many computer restarts, no matter how much opening the remote cover and pressing the reset button within?
Is it Toon Boom?
It could be anything.
I suspect driver issues.
Smooth. Smooooooooth.
that has three buttons.
It’s a great idea, but my dinky monkey hands kept hitting that third button by accident while drawing. Back to the trusty two button pen. I know it’s vanilla. I know.
Aliexpress site which has software or different accessories with it but this is just for the tablet itself and that works out about 23 to 30 pounds depending on the site
so that's pretty sturdy inside box you get the tablet itself which has a protective layer on it and on that packaging you get a picture of their little mascot which is really cute
you have installed on the computer when you're putting a new one on especially if they're Wacom because they clash really badly so just always make sure you've cleared it in preparation of setting up a new tablet
you can make changes such as adjusting the working area to fit your screen dimensions changing your pressure sensitivity settings altering the function of the shortcut keys on the pen or the tablet turning
so as you know
I'm left-handed and I sometimes find it annoying when tablets default to right-handed mode when I'm trying to use them but this was really simple it stayed on the left-handed setting with the express keys on the right and it stayed that way when I turned the computer back off and on again which is something that some other brands including Wacom have actually failed at my first impression of this tablet is that it feels fairly sturdy for the price
it's very simple
one potential issue
this means that if you need to work with your tablet a distance away from your computer for example if you have a desktop tower on the floor you might struggle so
it's not the worst thing in the world but you definitely don't wanna buy a whole new tablet just to replace a functioning tablet or with just a broken cable
I chose to switch between pen and eraser to make up for the lack of eraser on the pen but I did find it presses down much more easily than my Wacom pen and other brands that I've tried so I ended up switching to the eraser more often than I intended to and rubbing out the lines I've just drawn the main thing I really liked about
I've never owned a tablet with a rechargeable pen because I constantly forget to recharge things and I know I would hate it so having to never worry about whether it has enough power is a huge plus also the pen
nib felt quite sturdy
I've used the pen
some tablets have a fabric loop on the side of the tablet for the pen such as some work on models or they have a separate stand quite frequently but with this one
I think this tablet isn't it to be fairly portable so I'm guessing a stand wasn't a priority but in that case I would personally like to have a little case for the pen to protect it while traveling in terms of using the pen it wasn't uncomfortable per se but I only used it for a couple of hours a time
I haven't really had a solid day to sit down and work so I've been working in a couple of hour increments in between retail shifts at the moment cos of Christmas so I haven't really had the chance to do all day drawing sessions
I definitely prefer the style of the pen I've used on other tablets and not sure why this one is so different so it wasn't uncomfortable as such for the time that I used it but it just felt more like the pen that would come a note-taking tablet or general entertainment tablet rather than a drawing tablet
as that makes sense
so if you want you can turn the tablet so that the express keys are facing you or facing away from you or to the left or to the right
that's actually very loud
so for example
I didn't change them because they felt comfortable to draw with however when it came to single and double clicking on layers menus etc sometimes towards the edge of the tablet it didn't quite recognize the movement and this is sometimes a problem observed in cheaper tablet models on the tablet surface
I initially did some practice sketches and clips to do with this to get used to working with an on screen tablet again after so long using a screen tablet and then I jumped paint tool
however as a point
Windows ink turned on
I thought it was important to mention that since it could potentially cause you to think your tablet is broken when it's just a feature of the operating system overall
it'll enable me to do that so if I do end up using it more I could give a review in the future for how well it performed long term for now from several weeks of use
I said it's one of the cheapest I've seen so it wouldn't be a huge investment for someone tentatively dipping a toe into the digital art world or for a parent buying on for their teenager
the setup was simple
it could do with the detachable and possibly longer cable and the pen has an unusual design which some people might not find comfortable for long-term use as for pros
it's very cheap
it feels fairly solid

about this tablet
I haven't had a chance to do any seasonal themed art because I've been really busy with retail work and freelance so apologies for a lack of any holiday themed videos
so thank you so much for your incredible support and I'm so looking forward to making more content in the new year provided copper doesn't come along and do something totally fun like decimate my channel
who knows better
start swearing a lot
so they know
I'm kidding anyway
I'm really sorry
I guess I might sound really stupid in this video since I don't have too much to compare it to but you know I got a start somewhere as they say
I mean sorry
this is output
you got your output thingies you got your your input thingies your HDMI 's and USBs and whatnot the the plug they sent me was unfortunately like a European one they might have gotten confused like which nation I am in or they didn't have any other plugs so unfortunately this is this is all I got
I don't know if that's like I don't know fortunately I did have a u.s. adapter for this so that wasn't too much of a problem but yeah make sure you have enough room for these things cuz on your laptop cuz the delt
here's the mechanism
of course the stylus
it's not computer it's recording so it also comes with this hand sock thingy which to me is very useful because I have a sweating problem because I'm always built up with nervous energy
all of that
I don't know but I just use my keyboard most of the time so I was actually kind of surprised with how easy this was to set up relatively speaking you just kind of plug it all in and then you download this driver thing and you're good to go
there's this like little keeping pouch for it you know it's it's just seems like too styrofoam ish materials put together nothing amazing but you know it does the job you know
Mouse if you're not in a paint program and everything else for some reason my film my capture screen recording thing is the only thing that it like weirds out on
it's already a drawing
I've been doing mostly traditional stuff lately so I don't really I haven't had much practice with digital art trying to go for a kind of I don't know what I'm going for really it's Steven universe
let's let's keep going
Perl is pretty simple
she's like super thin
I forgot about that
let's line the stomach
well see then
no siree well
so that's useful but we need to erase this stuff kind of regret making you guys choose the paint program because I think I would be able to do a better job on on Photoshop even even if I don't know that even if I'm not very experienced in it
let's do combination uh
I know they're pastel
like right
you know when I started this I was like you know maybe I should like try and make it look kind of good but now I'm just like uh no I gave up a while ago
do you need
well this was
I'm so sorry that that this is what my channel is so as far as I'm concerned the gaomon PD one five six zero is pretty much what I expected
I think it goes for something like close to $500 but yeah that's about all I have to say about it anyway my name is Soler sands and goodbye you
hey guys Leila here and welcome back to my channel and today I am checking out the part lo a 640 graphic drawing tablet and definitely want to talk about this art
just really quick
I mean not completely
sensitivity is amazing
you get your
I went to erase and I kind of couldn't because that's not there so I have to actually click the eraser and erase with the erasing tool and then click back again to pencil to continue so that slows down my progress just a little and I'm basically just playing around with poses trying to figure out what exactly I'd like to draw
I know I want to do like this portrait that the camera is kind of looking down all right and then when I have like a basic sketch or an idea of a pose and stuff like that it go ahead and I make a nother layer and it's gonna be another sketch and it sounds kind of excessive but it's kind of like my refining sketch and then I just lighten up my base sketch significantly and then go in with a different color and start sort of going over these lines going with a more serious look for my character she is a warrior and I'm gonna take this black globe off cuz I just I'm really not a fan of it
I don't know but I'm not too crazy about it all right and that's pretty much my sketch and then basically from here I create another layer and then this time I select all black
I'm genuinely impressed
what is a tablet
I need back in
I don't know the most expensive the most top of the line product ever and the truth is I didn't my first digital piece was just really awful but I learned obviously but I wish I could have saved myself hundreds of dollars in the process of learning
because it's just crazy to me that $30 can get you this because this was on par with if not better than the tablet that I had back in 2005 and I had gotten a Wacom in two O's so that was I mean it wasn't a Cintiq or anything by any means but that was pretty top-of-the-line I'm really in love with the pen pressure sensitivity
I feel it really gives me good line weight when I need it and I can go really soft or I can go just really hard and get this really thick bold line and that's amazing
and that mostly has to do with the fact that this is a pretty small tablet and it's more of a personal issue because the thing is I that have specifically stayed away from smaller tablets only because I know that my strokes are a lot longer and they're like that because I like for my lineart to be extremely smooth so it's just a way of drawing that I personally enjoy
one continuous line like so and so depending on what kind of an artist you are whether you make short strokes or long strokes plays a factor into what sort of a tablet you should get and so with the line art done
it's just about finding a way around those issues because I still came out with what I consider a pretty smooth piece that that I'm really excited to now color and so when it comes to coloring I go ahead and I make another layer and I place it under my line
art layer that way my lines will show regardless of if I color over it like so and then when I color I kind of like outline or block a certain area like so and then I just get my bucket tool and fill it in and then repeat the process and there are definitely other ways to color things and this absolutely is not the only way I used to use the selection tool and so the selection tool I'm talking about is just I select this little wand right here and then I go to my line
art layer and let's say this is a part of her skin so let's go ahead and click it and you see how it fills it in blue and click it right here because that's her skin
I can click over to my color pencil I click back onto my coloring layer and then I fill it in like so and so that was fast and I generally like it but sometimes I feel like it's nitpicking
I'm sure there are other ways to block in colors that I haven't looked into so yeah and then I just do my lighter areas for where the light would be hitting her skin
my line art layer
I know it makes no sense right now but it allows me to see if I would like to give her lips a different look make them a little bit open cuz they seem a little too tight lipped closed
well no
they're not really tattoos
I'm going to change it and so throughout the video you may notice I like zoom in and zoom out kind of like constantly and I do it just because like right now
I'm doing one of the locks and I'm shading it and I'm putting these little detailed lines on it moving to the next one and so on and so forth and then I don't finish the entire hair without zooming out and looking at it because I don't know what the end result is gonna be until I zoom out and I look and I'm like okay
I swim back in and keep going because if I just go ahead and do the entire head of hair without zooming out then I'm probably gonna be a little letdown if I were to zoom out and it looked awful so kind of like a time saver and just another thing that's really nice about digital art because I can just zoom in as much as I want well not as much as I want
and just really get all these little fine details that I want in the end result of my piece or as depending on how big you draw or how small you draw affects how much detail you can put in to your piece when you're doing traditional one weird thing that I've encountered is the pen has buttons on it which is normal my
Wacom tablet pen has little like buttons on it as well that you can tap and I was using it for color selecting like quickly like my colors and all of a sudden it stopped working halfway through and I initially dismissed it because I figured well you know maybe I just had it on the wrong setting maybe I accidentally changed a setting
I'm you know wasn't sure and I was having trouble when I installed this previously with getting into the driver customizations or the pen digitizer customizations actually and I couldn't get in and I don't know what is going on as far as that goes
I tried troubleshooting it
and for whatever reason
I can't customize settings the way that I need it to on the pen and it's a little annoying but I figured I should just mention that as one of the only issues I'm having with this beyond the pen just not having a eraser end and the whole size of the tablet not being able to support longer strokes kind of thing so just figured I'd mention it and that's that I'm so excited to have done a digital piece with this video today
I didn't have much trouble with creating this piece and I'm actually really so excited with it so if you enjoyed this video maybe comment like and subscribe and I'll see you next time
thanks guys bye
hey everyone so today
I couldn't find any great information out there specifically for this so I wanted to do a review so I got three different tablets from B&H first is the Wacom one and this is kind of their cheaper low-end model and then we got the Wacom Intuos
this thing is tiny
it's great for travel
it's just super simple
Intuos is a little bit taller because of the buttons the usable area is all the same on all of these actually so even though they have very different physical sizes the actual area they can use is all the same so then finally we have the Intuos Pro
it is quite big
it's got this big nice rubber strips on the bottom so it keeps it from moving around this thing is solid so you also have six programmable buttons here and you also have a scroll wheel with the button in the middle of it so you can use this for zooming
I prefer to actually use the pen for that and program it but the the program will programmable buttons are quite nice and they have a little raised area here so you can feel where the middle one is and then you can see on here that these little marks
but this is the actually usable area of the tablet so the rest of it is really just extra space for your kind of hand to rest on so the the pro model is is bluetooth enabled so you can use this wirelessly which I have been using and on a Mac it works perfectly
I have heard complaints from other friends that have a Windows machine that do have major lag if using bluetooth so that's something to consider if you have a Windows machine
that has faster
Windows but my Mac
so there's a switch here you can turn the touch feature on and off and I've quite frankly have found the touch on this to be pretty annoying so I usually leave
activating it when
and if you're gonna use the pro wired then it does have a USB C port so a nice modern port on that the other the Intuos and the why these have just the regular old
not that big of a deal but if you want to keep all your wire is the same then that might be important for you but otherwise they work fine
Wired there isn't a wireless available so that's something to consider and that's probably my biggest consideration of why I would get the Intuos instead so this particular into us is the wired version
I got this so I won't be keeping this one because of that but I will be ordering another one that does have the Bluetooth wireless because they do have this available in the Intuos
well for portability again
I would get the wireless version for the best portability so you know no wires everywhere the Intuos Pro again is it could work for travel but it is much bigger and much heavier so it's not ideal but it could definitely work
it's still not huge so it's definitely something you could use for travel so let's talk about the pins a little bit so first off these two have pen holders built into them
so that's a great option for travel to make sure you always keep your pen with you and then the the Intuos also has this but it's just on the side instead of the top so that works really well very convenient the Intuos Pro as you can see does not have that it instead comes with this little pin holder
um this base also has a little tip remover in here so there's just a hole in the middle where you can actually twist this to the side and pull out the tip so if you need to replace it that makes it really easy not necessary but it's kind of handy so I'll talk about the actual pens a little bit here so there you can see on the left is the Intuos Pro in the middle is the Intuos and on the right is the one so the one is obviously the shortest and the in twist is just slightly longer than that and the pro is just so much bigger than both of them and this is actually a pretty good thing
it just feels good in your hands just a really nice pin so see a close-up of this it's has a really nice thick base here that you can grab onto and it's also got this really rubbery it's actual rubber surface here so it's really nice
it's really comfortable
so when you flip this over and use it on the tablet it actually switches to the eraser and programs like Photoshop for photography really not necessary so that should not be a consideration for you but otherwise it's got buttons
that feel really nice
you cannot use this with the other tablets so I thought about I could just buy it the into us and get a pin from the pro and use that but they are proprietary so I at least I haven't found a way to use them with other tablets you have to use it with its model and the pro pen is very expensive anyway
so then you've got the this is the Intuos pen so it's definitely a step down so you can see it's got a little bit of flange to it for gripping on to now it's much more shallow than the pro but it still feels pretty good
it's totally usable
so it is skinnier than the pro as well so it just doesn't feel quite as good but again it's decent and then we've got the one which you can see
it's very lightweight it just doesn't feel professional totally usable but definitely not my favorite so other than that the the actual feel of these pens is a little bit different and I think it's actually the texture of the tablet surface rather than the Pens itself
it's just
it just kind of has a scratchy sound to it but it works just fine and the feeling of it the pressure and everything works just as well as the pro
and then we've got the the one this is more like the end to us and you can see that they probably use it pretty much the same surface on these but the the pro one just has a little bit nicer surface so other than that um to connect the Perot you just click on the the middle button and blue light will flash and then it says it's connected to bluetooth takes a second
disconnecting it's worked fantastically
that's one thing
I wish I could test but I'm I'm assuming it probably works close to the same and also I've only charged this once and I've been using it for months now so I haven't been using it like hardcore everyday but I haven't had to recharge it yet
I'm impressed with that but one thing I really do like about the pro is that you have this extra space over here so I'm a lefty so you would be using it
so that when you're working with it you're not hanging over vs. it's either one of these so if I look at the end to is I don't have anywhere to put my hand here so if I'm working on the extreme edge of this them a hand has to be hanging off and it's kind of awkward
it's not bad it's nice to have the the extra space on this one if you're right-handed it's gonna be flipped around so your right hand will be over here and then you have access to your buttons with your free left hand all right so now
I want to show you some settings that I've set up for the pen so I'm using it to his Perot so I have the pro pencil I did and then what I did was I added Photoshop as one of the applications
I've done is set it up to be control option as a modifier and then in Photoshop if I'm using the brush tool if I hold down that bottom button and then move from right to left that changes my brush size and if I go up and down it changes it from soft to hard
I can easily zoom in and out just by clicking and dragging anywhere and it actually centers where you have your cursor so it'll zoom to that area so if I do it up in this corner it's gonna zoom there so it makes it really easy to navigate so I love these
so let me
so this is without those settings turned on so you can see basically it's not pressure-sensitive so it's gonna be all based upon the size of your brush and you'd have to manually set the opacity so I'd have to come up here and change this
I really find this to be the exceptional tool is when I turn on the pressure sensitivity for the size as well so now when I brush I press really light
so that's a really cool setting and you can also go the other way and just use it for the size so if I turn this one off but I have this one on now the size is gonna change
and the opacity so you increase the really fine lines if you're really lightly touch or you can really come in really a blast an area if you need to so
I expected them to feel a bit different but quite frankly they're the same so I you know this one has a ridiculous amount of different pressure sensitivity levels and you know the the wacom one has many many less pressure sensitivity levels but for what we do in
Photoshop is photographers
I couldn't really notice a difference the only thing I really noticed was that the the Intuos not the into his pro actually felt like I get finer lines out of that but I might be imagining that
I'm not really sure but overall I cannot tell a difference and so that really doesn't matter in my opinion for photographers if you're a graphic designer you're like doing paintings something like that
yeah it's not that big of a deal so if I wanted to do some burning and dodging on this image I can create a new layer set the blending mode to soft light and now I can just come in with my brush and either paint black or white so black if I want a dark and white if I want to brighten it up
so let's start with the white and yeah we'll just leave the settings as 100% but my got my pressure sensitivity on so now if I wanted to brighten up these grasses up here you can see I can do a really fine area or if I press a little harder you can kind of spread that out see
and then of course if I wanted my opacity to stay the same then I would uncheck that and then it's just going to affect my size based upon the pressure
I'm going to go the other way actually so I'm gonna turn on the opacity turn off size so that way size remains big but how much I apply is gonna depend on how hard I press so again usually
so now let's say
I don't want that I'm gonna do that so I might have to actually just lower the opacity to do what I want to do here and I I need a bigger brush
do your really specific but I just wanted to show you how this works to start with so I can create really nice burning and dodging without the need for selections necessarily a lot of this
I can just get done by just going over and because I have really fine control you know this is not not exactly what I would do is just a demonstration and then if I need to zoom into an area again I hold down my top button and you can see how it zooms in
to where my cursor is so if I pick over here it's gonna zoom in to that area so that makes it super fast to get around and what I would recommend doing
I mean everywhere
so if you program one of these buttons to be the spacebar that turns of the pan tool and then you combine that with me the top button on your pen and you can easily zoom in and hold down this button to pan around or if you can just reach around you could always use the spacebar on your keyboard of course with the with a
Wacom one you don't have any buttons on that so you would have to use your keyboard but so there's also these panels that you can bring up that are from the Wacom software
brings up this
go to the lasso tool so it gives you really quick access with these bigger buttons rather than trying to pick on these tiny buttons in Photoshop and this is totally customizable
it's a little clunky
you really don't need anything bigger than the small and it's actually gonna cause you more problems because of the way that a tablet works so it's important to first understand that it's not like a mouse where you move it to get to where you want to go this area is actually mapped to your screen
that's where the cursor is gonna go so when I have this down in the right-hand corner of my tablet my cursor is going down here and if I put it up over here then it's going to go up to the upper left-hand corner so the thing is if you have two monitors then what happens is that this gets mapped to the size of both monitors so I've brought on my Wacom tablet settings for this which will help you make more sense out of this so you can see
I've got two monitors here and you can see here that under if you go under the the pen settings and then go to mapping it shows you how the screens are gonna be mapped to the tablet so in this case if I put my cursor or if I put my pin on the left side of the tablet what it's doing is it's going over here to this side of this screen and if I put it like right in the middle then it's going right in the middle of these two screens and if I go far over here it's going to the right of course so it's not like a mouse where you scroll it to get to where you want it's just mapped to the tablet and so the thing is with two screens then your active area when you're like using
half of the tablet so really fine adjustments become harder because it's such a small area to work with so what I've found is that it's best to actually map
two which is what
I'm using Photoshop
I've got it maps to both screens so when I'm not using Photoshop I can still use this as a mouse and go over both of my screens but if I have Photoshop active then it's mapped to the entire tablet and I actually can't use it outside of Photoshop really which can be a pain if you're like switching back and forth between applications a lot but I also have Lightroom map to this so it's really personal preference if you want to do this because if you if I now want to go to your screen I can't I would have to use my trackpad or my mouse to then go click something else and then
I think the ideal setup really is if you have a lot of money to spend I would get the medium size if you have dual monitors or a huge monitor and then get a small one for travel because the medium ones are
they're huge so
it gives you bigger area to work with but the problem with this is then you have to move your whole arm a lot further because of the way these things are mapped out so rather than just working in a tiny area you might actually have to like move huge distances so that can become really fatiguing and it might actually decrease your precision because you have to move in large areas so
I mean I can do some pretty refined stuff and if I meet you then I just zoom in and then I can work with this smaller area so I I really don't think the medium is necessary but that's just personal preference
so we're gonna do an unboxing gonna test it out and I'll give a bit of a review on it so let's go okay so here it is on the
Galman website itself
that this tablet is it designed for the first thing would be Android users so you can just take it out of your pocket of your bag and just use drawing apps and again games which seems to be the second kind of primary feature that this is really designed for
I will be looking to see how this works as a graphics tablet for artists of course so I took this upstairs where I'd have a lot more natural light now
we have a side pouch which has the USB cord the pen itself and then finally the tablet which also hides some USB and C connectors a glove and yeah we have the extra case over here on the side so everything just kind of comes in like that
I do like that
initial surface texture
it's got four
I used to use these tablets for years I would put them in my lap so for the desk users it does have some very nice anti-slip grips placed at the bottom
so you can place them probably any surface and the thing is not moving the other thing that I used to have a problem with when using a tablet in my lap almost like a game controller is the USB connection would often get loose and fall out and would add a little bit of wear and tear to the actual cord over a longer span well
I have had with
you know even pretty popular name-brand tablets such as Wacom in the past so the again the build quality on this is actually very very good so I went in
I use alt alot because I like to do a lot of coloring and when I'm digitally aiming and that allows me to just to pick colors really quickly at least from within the canvas now a mini alt on the keyboard here as you can see
nothing's really happening
I actually use is most of the time my drawing tablet which is on display too so but if I I noticed when I did switch it to the second display here I can't bring the mouse over to it
I just thought that was interesting that even though it allows me to do this and unless I'm of course missing something I can't make it control that so it again
is to see how it actually feels like you know to make some marks and everything so yeah that it's pretty good it has like a very firm surface then again
this tablet surface area is is a little quite a bit small and I'm typically used to so like one flick of the wrist and it covers you know a huge amount of space or distance rather but it's easy enough to get the lines down
I use a fair amount and it doesn't seem to happen tilt or rotation options that I'm usually used to on it so again on a budget tablet like this
I probably wouldn't use it on more kind of sweeping and gestural type of drawings but it's something kind of small or more um geometric or I can use the tools pretty well too just using like shift clicks or
and it's just good for something like this to warm up a tech on and tablet just to kind of get a sense for how these are working see like
Photoshop natively has a smoothing option - I can amp up so see it makes some of these lines a little bit more smooth but it's one of those things - like once you start using you know
it feels tiring
the new joy 11 addresses some performance issues on its predecessor and is now powered by a cherry trail-based intel atom x5 z8350 quad-core processor made it to 4 gigabytes of ddr3 ram
inch ips
active pen stylus
the tablet features a usb-c port for charging and data transfers and it still has a micro usb port a headphone jack and a micro sd card slot to expand storage
but if you were to use it for emails in some social media browsing this device handles the job very well what joy truly wants to achieve here is to combine both pc and tablet experiences into one single device which is why this device is loaded up with android 5.1 lollipop
conserve the tablet's battery life for a full day of use since there are productivity tasks that can already be achieved in android having dual operating systems on a single device is a great feature however when the device storage is split for both operating systems it becomes an issue for some sure you can expand storage with a microsd card but they can cost a lot if you were to buy those with fast
i wish there was an option for me to just have the device run only windows because i already own a phablet android device that substitutes my tablet experience when it comes to power consumption
ringgit if you want a better typing experience i just hope there will be a 64 gigabyte storage model offered in the market and i will gladly pay some extra cash for windows only model and let's hope that happens in the near future you
the one edgy
teenage me was so adamant about having why did I do that why have I never changed it after much debate on how big of a sellout I would be
it's great nice
alright let's take a look at this bad boy so it's got a pretty decent size and it's got an array of 10 customizable hotkeys on the side plus it's got this little circle button which
let's go inside
nice little fabric
it's in a neat
it's it's pretty light
I don't know if that's a style choice or makes it more aerodynamic or something I'm just gonna put that back in here and also comes with this handy dandy wrist guard
probably not as cool
it's easy to install
I like I'm thick
I like a chunky however I did play around with the pen sensitivity and did find it very receptive the thing I really liked and I think makes this tablet really
the inside is a button and the outside is kind of like a scroll wheel you hit the inner button and it rotates the function between scrolling magnifying and pen size though the pen size option doesn't work on all programs
okay the things
I just didn't find them in a cursory glance the other thing I didn't like was that I constantly leave my laptop on and just simply close it when I'm done I found this freezes the tablet and it's stuck in scrolling mode just unplugging the tablet and plugging it back in fixes this right up again this can be solved by me properly shutting down my computer but other tablets have had no issue with this
I have never had an issue with a tablet dealing with the programs I use this thing crashed more than if so facts of Ultron 4 and that video was hella cursed
just flat out disappeared
I do enjoy the scroll wheel button and the fact that the pen is battery free however I did find issues with the programs I use so if I give it a 7 out of 10
what somebody's and gentlemen
welcome back this videos
Android 9.0 Pi
it comes in at three gigabytes of RAM and 32 gigabytes of full-fledged storage along with a 13 megapixel camera on the rear it also has a front camera along with a screen resolution of 1920 by 1200
well of course first of all the price it comes in at a really really low price considering the absolutely awesome processor inside of here running at up to one or two point six gigahertz and of course three gigs of ram
so that can give you a pretty solid boost when you're trying to do things like gaming on here but at the same time it does a really really good job of running your day-to-day tasks like you know browsing the web watching YouTube videos
I would say that this thing is a really really enjoyable tablet because of the giant wide screen basically as a 10.1 inch full HD 1920 by 1200 resolution and the IPS display allows you to get really really creative with how you use it you know you can watch Netflix
and then all of a sudden you could be gaming after that you could be doing whatever and running all of this is a giant battery 6000 milliamps and it can give you up to 15 hours of reading browsing the web or watching movies or playing games now obviously a little less battery when you're doing more intensive tasks like movies and playing games but still battery life on this is pretty solid now if you run out of storage or something of those sorts you also get a micro SD card slot
storage as well
so everything that you're supposed to take off on a tablet that you would expect in the 400 to 500 range if this thing takes off at a much much lower price but you can see a new link below so awful
what's up guys
Pro from XP fen
entry-level pen display
I know if you're on a budget you can pick up a pen tablet without a display or screen for much less money but I have to stress that if you really want to get serious about your art or animation
IPS display with the color gamut of 72% NTSC eight customizable shortcut keys and a red dial which I'm excited to test out up to sixty degrees of tilt support a battery free pen understand
drawing on
this thing just feels great because they chose a matte finish on the display rather than a glossy one this means the colors will be dulled a bit but it provides a good measure of pen control
which for me boost my confidence while drawing so I'm glad to make the trade also full HD looks really great on such a small screen just don't know what to say to add to the drawing experience we have a battery free pen it senses 8192 levels of pressure which is expected for all tablets display or not these days
it's a personal preference than a big deal really but I does have an effect on the strokes that I make while drawing this pen also features sixty degrees of tilt support which as an animator
I'll show you the difference between the artists 12 Pro in my current drawing monitor but the display is only one of the best things about the drawing experience the express keys and dial are an easy tiebreaker going with the trend of best things first
so my hand doesn't get tired as fast but this thing truly shines when using it to scroll through frames while animating this may not look like much to anyone who doesn't animate but being able to quickly flip through your animation to check the movement of your subject is just really useful actually the Express keys
the customization is great
I can think of is that you can't press and hold down on an express key to repeat its function like a keyboard does but nevertheless it's just a small nitpick overall the drawing experience on this thing is just
in this design
it looks pretty cool
it wouldn't be that bad if the stand or the tablet had some vase of screw holes on the back so you can mount it to monitor arm so you can adjust the height that way but sadly none a present
it actually feels better to set this thing up on the couch and draw while you're relaxing but on a desk the angle of the screen forces me to look down at it which is really uncomfortable
I prefer a much higher angle for drawing an animating so I put some books under the stand which solved the issue for the most part to be fair though they do sell a height adjustable stand for 50 dollars so if you have the extra cash maybe check it out and see if it helps otherwise for me
anyway but those of you who are looking for a tablet to take with you to work or school should know that the set up is a little messy looking
I'm pretty happy with the build and setup of this tablet however I would like to see a USBC 2 USB C connection like their artist 22r tablet for those of you who have a USB C port on their systems because it would just make this thing that much more portable ok
what they included stand and to make matters worse the lack of ASA compatibility so with all that out of the way only one question remains can I recommend this 250 dollar budget pen display to anyone looking for a way to get into digital art or animation and my answer is yes the artist all pro from XP pen has earned the noble frugal seal of approval because of its premium laminated display awesome shortcut keys and dial and highly customizable settings in the driver software

let's review my product
hello everybody JD
no this is designed for kids in the fact that it comes with twenty pre-installed educational apps and it also plays the loudest Looney Tunes sound that I have turned on in Bell the night and forgot how loud the sound is until it's yelling and wait
I mean
my camera is not
Android go edition
you did
the idea hottie
there does so here
I've tried to figure out how to turn it off no idea but just FYI you are bringing this and getting it for your kids and your in somewhere where you need to be quiet
this tablet you know
that's entirely possible
there is a camera in the back there is room for an SD card because it does have about 16 gigabytes of memory with SH even with my few apps I've installed on top of the 20 pre-installed ones
of course you can delete and install different apps and adjust it accordingly to make it enough space but there isn't as d card slot for when and if you need to add a little more memory
it's about ten hours but once you start adding in animation or streaming or anything like that streaming is about 3.5 hours of Wi-Fi streaming and then five hours of offline video
that's really not bad
keep in mind
you need to charge it the first three times for six full hours even if the battery says it's a hundred percent charge it for the full six hours the first three times when I first started using this tablet the first two times I used it before the third official charge
I mean a decent battery life for what you plan to do with it and especially just kids games etc etc so it does have the Play Store like I said and some of these apps I've installed to use for my own just productivity just saying I actually really liked this tablet for um myself it's marketed as a kid's tablet but it's just a really cute size and it's just been fun so a lot keep in mind
Hooked on Phonics which is really the biggest seller and this one really is the biggest seller of all of them because it you didn't play different reading Lohan there's like different reading levels for the Hooked on Phonics which is really fun and cute and when you turn on the music obviously can hear it a little bit better but it's just super cute
just keep in mind and you can create different accounts on it so if you have different kids who are different age levels or what they can each have their own divided games and profiles on here
Darden math games vomits for learning sensory baby touch sweet Empire some other just cute apps some of them are just fun and some of them are obviously educational based so it's just a great little tablet and it's it's easy to hold
this is very grippy
kids are sometimes will sticky fingers sometimes candy or just other things on their hands with you all over and you can just tape this off rinse it put it back on
the camera quality mediocre
I need a super cute adorable selfie obviously I I mean you know the quality's not really that bad but it's uh but there is that front camera and then there's the back camera back there so that's pretty much it standard fun
which does have parental lock and other controls on this where you can fully customize it one of the apps actually set on the parental control and almost locked myself out being able to access the rest of the apps which so it works is basically what
it didn't help you
just stay definitely on the app that you said that they can play on obviously for older children that to be a little complicated they understand the rules of how to get around these things but for the under ones it's a good
Ted and there is also a screen protector on here to try and keep it less dirty even when I touch it if you can see any of that but my fingerprints don't stay on even after touching it which is kind of nice if you use any other kind of tablet you know that the fingerprints did all over and that seems to keep it just very clean looking which may or may not matter to you but it also helps keep it shatterproof if you do drop it
hello gamers so today
i don't really use them mainly because i end up confusing myself but uh for this review i was gonna try my best to try to use them and also real quick
well does it run
well honestly
yeah it runs pretty nice so i'll admit i was having some trouble with it mainly because recently i had switched over to using tablets that had the screen on it instead of just the flat surface but after getting adjusted to it it runs very nicely
the only thing that seemed to work out was the little scroll wheel in the middle which i was using basically this entire time to zoom in and zoom out
i'm really really not a fan of small tablets mainly because my body doesn't know how to stay in one goddamn place so using this tablet really had me feeling like i could just let loose it
what about the price
i definitely think that that's what it's worth for its quality i believe that my very first tablet was just about over a hundred dollars and that was a very itty bitty little small tablet
it's sleek looking
it's nice it runs
that is the end
because he's a little rambunctious and it's a little quieter when he's in school so let me turn it on and show you some of the features that it has this is the on/off button
is the home screen
it's in there um
it really does so
all right look okay
I'm gonna turn it down a bit okay and when when I have it on battery I I like to have really low cause it saves battery but I did purchase the adapter because you can run through batteries pretty quickly and I also purchased the carrying case because I don't want to drop it and break it
and the cord
takes pitches of the room and then you can take those pictures and he does really two things with them because it has an app where you can play with them and make them really jazzy so he loves that takes videos of the cat
so he has his games on here in the games you can purchase online mine the games some of the the cartridges have games with them also so here is games so he knows in there and pick the game that he wants and whenever you want to go back to something else you just press the home screen it's pretty easy self-explanatory
don't look at me because I'm just a little early in the morning but i'ma show you because it's this is what he just thinks it's just so much fun so this is the camera
is the camera button the camera button and you can also go up here and um they'll give you different funny things to do with your picture like here's a funny face so you can put this up and put your face in here and do like camera and he thinks that's pretty funny
he has a little bit of a heavy hand and I'm afraid he's going to press too hard right now because he doesn't have the dexterity right now to know not to press so hard so right now we're kind of just doing with the hand and um so
right now yeah
you've got to if that connects to your iTunes library on the computer so I'm working on that but this is just a lot of fun and you can turn
it's keeping him occupied
it's keeping his mind expanded and um it's just it when he gets over whelmed with you know busyness we sit down and we quiet time we read so it's just something that we really really love so
I want to thank mom central for sending this um for my little guy to review and I want to thank VTech and if you have any deaths that this is a product for you
thank you mom
got it now
christmas is fast approaching
it's a fairly average spec in today's market but that's not the key feature here is the parental controls and the app store but more on that later in the box you get the tablet a thick rubber bumper case power brick and usb cable plus a user manual with kids in mind
i know this
it's soft to touch and you can get a nice comfortable grip on the tablet too as for performance and from my point of view as someone who sees a fair few tablets
it can be connected to your home network via wi-fi allowing you to download that additional content if you wanted to there is only 16 gigabyte of on-board storage which should be enough as the games available are not huge
your child is allowed to play at the tablet for example they can use the tablet for one hour during four to five pm on a weekday and say two hours on a saturday only and if they try outside these times they just can't it's locked out and a message comes up on screen saying you cannot play if you're feeling mean
you can set different timings for weekdays and weekends but not specific days of the week there are also options to select which apps stories or features are available to use during those times which is also quite nice for me
there is an extra time feature add an hour or whatever you want just that one time without the need to change the existing schedules as for the app store
and then after that it's either a monthly quarterly or yearly fee which is 39.99 which gives you full access to the store download and play what you want for free
i'm pleasantly surprised
and it was great
i really like this
i like that
console or e-reader it's a solid seven out of ten for me while my daughter gave it a 9 out of 10 and it only lost a point because i told her it didn't have netflix
make sure to give this video a thumbs up if you have enjoyed it and if you want more make sure you hit that subscribe button and our future videos will pop up in your feed
Nova spirit Eggman today
let's get started now
I'll leave a link in the description below and they offer two and a half models when I say two and a half models it's because they actually offered that pika go and the people go pro and then the people go pro with 4G connectivity so that's not really a full different model it's just get added some new features into it now for the pika go they actually have the same CPU across the board which is an Intel Z a350
in a little bit then on the regular model they have the four gigs of ram with 64 gigabytes of emmc while the pro offers 8 gigs of RAM and 128 megabytes of emmc
this is the screen
this has a really pretty screen its IPS panel at a resolution of 190 to 0 by 1200 and they do suggest using a scaling a dpi scaling of 200 but
here's another feature
keyboards are disabled
total weight of
I am getting about that much even more depending on how your usage is because I could be using it and then leave it on the side for a little bit and pick it up later and you know allows me for a pretty long time charging wise
they do recommend using a 5 volt 3 amp charger and it takes about two hours for me to fully charge it from zero to full which is really good
I actually drained the battery out of this guy up to zero like it would not even boot up anymore so it took about two hours from complete zero any more than three amps
I tried now as far as connectivity wise you have a USB C for charging and also this could be an OTG they have USB 3 they also have a micro HDMI so you can plug it into a big screen for presentations and stuff and now for the 4G models
I had to mention that they got a little tiny optical mouse thing on the bottom you can see and it actually works really really well with tapping and everything but there is no scrolling and when
I first using this
I was actually a little annoyed at that but I was like wait this is a touchscreen and I could just scroll by you know moving up and down and I realized that is much better because the way I hold it would be like this anyway so it worked out keyboard
typing on
and if you're not used to it you might hit those instead of the space bar but takes a few seconds to get used to it and you can type just that normal speed
it's a weaker cpu
it's actually coming from this area but very very light heat otherwise this thing somehow keeps itself cool without having to do anything or make any noise and that's one of the craziest features that
I didn't think I would at first but I've been using this for the past two three weeks and this has completely replaced my laptop not my desktop but my main laptop
little light work now
I do a lot of system admin work and also a lot of remote administrator from work so I do like mo desktop SSH all this other stuff a lot of things that don't really require the use of the CPU because I'm remotely connecting and also some light media work which is watching videos reading
Excel or Word
I mean if you need some more horsepower than that then yeah this might not be the guy for you because it is on a weaker CPU but ultimately for system is remote administrative remote management
I could read this normally and I have no problems reading it as well as you know pulling up the keyboard to type on this wasn't a problem at all another thing that I do like to use this on is like this type of mode where it's like a kind of tablet or stand mode you can say so I could watch my videos and just leave it on a stand without having to view the keyboard
I actually own the first triple e 701 PC and I love small computers and to find one that actually fits my needs which is like remote access and stuff like that
I thought they were gonna replace my big laptop by a smaller laptop but this I cannot type on this this is horrendous and keeping the GDP pocket - that didn't work very well either because you couldn't actually turn that into a tablet mode and I found myself being annoyed that is always stuck in like a laptop mode on my lap
it is a weaker
N 4100 was a great CPU for this guy or even the core M but you gotta keep in mind if you're gonna use a stronger CPU you're gonna be drawing more battery and it's gonna require active cooling which is a fan which will create noise on this guy
which is the 369 for this guy because I find myself using this like I said more than my main laptop that I paid $1,000 for is it made for everyone
you need remote administration
this thing is great
if you do a lot of like number crunching or video editing ya know this is not gonna work out for that do I recommend getting the pro version highly recommended you need the RAM Windows 10 eats up so much
so you know when the next video is gonna be out my friend and I started the gaming channel and now we are up to Episode two of our wild eight series so be sure to check that out and as I say my nerd cave hack till it hurts
I know I'm not gonna like it and then finally you get around to watching it and you're like I really liked that that's exactly how I felt about the artist 12 in fact I felt so good about it that I'm moving it to the top of my list of favorite 12 13 inch drawing displays because of its size
basically that means that it is a second monitor for your computer you plug it into your Windows or Mac computer or laptop or whatever and you can draw on it using the included pen
unlike most other displays it's full HD that's 1920 pixels by 1080 pixels now that's not a super high resolution but on a smaller screen like this when you condense it down it actually looks really good also has a 72% NTSC color range which is pretty standard for this kind of display
I personally prefer a little bit more texture but I will say I got used to this pretty quick and I didn't find it to be a problem at all the plus side
the display itself is pretty thin in light it manages to fit in a good number of Express keys along the side and they're customizable you can set them to different keyboard shortcuts
that too is customizable
I like to map my brush size to this so I could just swipe up and down to change sizes even though it's nice to have I'm gonna nitpick a little because really that's what I do
what's in the box
the top lid becomes its own pen holder and along the bottom you can unscrew it and find your extra nibs you get a drawing glove and you get a cleaning cloth
it's nothing special
but it's solid
so what's your finger
what you got there
I'm working on that
so you're not gonna be accidentally clicking it with your thumb as you draw also has an eraser on the back you flip the pen over and you can erase with it
hexagonal design
I don't want jitter
I don't want waves
I used this mostly out of Mac but I did install it on Windows to do a couple pen tests and I was finding it performed about the same across operating systems
this drawing test is one that I do when I first start using a display because it tells me what settings I want to be fiddling with just to make it feel natural and good for me when I'm drawing if the pressure blows out too fast I start looking for the pressure curve in the settings if I get some jitter or some I look to use a program with some stroke straighteners on my drawing program to help me out
I would call it a noticeably warmer spot and it didn't really affect me at all in fact I had to look for it in order to find it and overall I would say the things that I'm pointing out here are really nitpicks
because what we're talking about here is a device that cost 250 dollars whenever you reduce the price of the thing that you're looking for and you buy something cheaper you're gonna be making some trade-offs and I feel that the trade-offs you're making here are very very small
compared to the amount of value that you're gonna get and then kind of drawing quality you're going to get so basically what I'm saying is a 250 dollar device has no business being this
believe it or not
this is crazy
it's called game center
i mean
what's in the box
check this out
this is called canvas
you're on canvas pro
let's unbox this
okay hold on
let's lift this up
let's take this
oh this is sturdy
damn okay
y'all ready for that
say yuri on
oh my god
it's a glove
oh that was
that's tight ain't it
okay yuri huh
all right okay
here goes the instructions
okay check this out
look at this pack
if i'm not mistaken i think i know what this is something to kind of clean the screen with because you really can't go across the screen with tissue or anything like that because it'll scratch your screen
okay but yeah
check this out
y'all getting that
i'll probably put it back on there but yeah this that exact glove that they gave you was so you wouldn't really touch the screen with your physical hand and it's the same material as the claw
this is for
no they're not legs
okay anyway
okay the on
yeah okay now
i'm pretty sure they sell them somewhere if you just if you mess this one up but if you spent a thousand dollars for 700 you're not gonna mess it up
okay anyway
zoom in on that
get that man
that's just my guess
i'm an artist
it feels good
okay yeah man
that was smart
and i'm pretty sure that this would screw in like this and we'll have this put together the next time we view this video on it and we'll actually be drawing something on it but yeah if you lift up it moves so this will sit pretty high for you man
this is a 22
this is the hdmi
now this baffles me
this is a design
vga out yeah
two three one two three four the power cord the power cord the glove and this cloth all in this box and they thought of something they said they give you a a dongle with it
hey man what y'all do man you know they gave you wine okay and you can you get the stand which is going to be very helpful when we come back in our next video and we actually have a cold anime on here or a portrait or something
i'm glad they
but you get these manuals the glove the pan and i see that sticks to that unless you take it out of there one two three four cords and the stand with the screw
tag out there
so we'll probably be playing a few games talking to the manager there finding out what deals they do on what nights you know and you know yeah something to do man something to look at something to be positive about something to have to wake up to do to go do this that of going to the bowling alley all the time
let me give you a closer look at that so this is an IPS display on here as well so really good viewing angles and when I first turned this on
I thought to myself
let's be fair
you know
I'm very very impressed
this is the sort of pre-installed apps we have of course got the Google Play Store on there as well installed pretty much any app that you want and it's running Google Android version 5
it's nice and snappy you do see some lag and jitters in some screen transitions but for the most part it works extremely well and playing a game on a screen
balance and the speaker's just at the top of the screen there you can see two speakers and they work really well front-facing as well so many tablet manufacturers do a great design up front and then they put the speakers where you're going to hold the tablet what use is that that's no use at all
cuz you're going to be muting the speakers even having them on the side isn't that fantastic but for me the front-facing speakers when you're watching back a movie was a really good move really very very good decision now
we've got micro
we've got an input for the included power supply and then we've also got a little pinhole mind if we take a quick look on this top leading edge we've also got the volume control the power on/off button and then we've also got that rear facing five megapixel camera so this has actually got a really nice array of ports and it just works extremely
well what more can
I say the main selling point is something like this has to be that screen very very nice screen little bit cumbersome to use in portrait orientation for reading but certainly for browsing the internet multimedia use watching back videos media consumption
there's slightly different tone
so we've got this harder plastic material here and then this soft touch rubber material around the outside and that also goes down these sides as well and that just makes it a lot nicer to grip but it does show fingerprints a little bit more
I think they've done that to accommodate the speakers which are really good speakers and the price point that this is coming in that is very impressive indeed now I don't talk about prices in my videos because they changed so so quickly
this is the hannspree

another product review.
In this video
I’ll do a side-by-side comparison of their hardware specs and features, and I’ll also run some benchmarks to measure their performance, and will see if the price is deserving of the product
One USB charging cable.
is that the new
S21 which is the one on to the left is slightly taller, and its bezel is slightly thicker than the S20, that sports a thinly bezel and is slightly shorter.
If you look the base of both models only the S20 has its internal speakers positioned there. So I’ll startup both tablets, complete their startup wizard’s, and proceed with their system and hardware information.
And to begin, let’s compare their system and hardware information. Under system it shows that both models have the same mainboard. The S20 comes with 3GB of RAM, and the S21 comes with 2GB. Both RAM types are DDR3.
On the CPU information it shows that both models are running on the same CPU which is a 64 bit octa-core cortex A55 processor clocked at 1.6 GHz, with support for 64 bit ABIs
Both models do not carry a 1920 x 1080p resolution hence why you don’t see the HD icon appearing at the bottom of the both videos. However if you activate Chromecast you will see that the HD icon and the 5.1 icon appearing on the both tablets.

so hi it's sible
i'm actually recording this from an airbnb right now i set up a kofi to help with moving costs if you're able to chip in or want to support my content i'll put a link in the description under the tablet information
under that which i didn't realize for the entire video i ended up peeling it off later but i drew the majority of the piece i made with the tablet
i took it off
the colors improved significantly
there's a power cord and hdmi slash usb cords to connect your computer in the box as well it also comes with a pen stand which includes a nib remover on the bottom and a bunch of replacement nibs inside for when your pen nib wears down the pen is lightweight and very cylindrical
there was a noticeable
wear on the web after i'd drawn with it for a while but the friction of drawing on the matte screen protector for so long might have sped that up
this tablet doesn't come with a stand but the company wanted me to include this clip to show you how you can get a free one if you purchase through amazon
i did have an issue initially with getting my undo command to work properly with my program paint tool sai i contacted gaomin and they were very helpful in walking me through possible solutions
that shows more of the character's face and expression to kind of show off this advantage of the tablet size the character in this piece is my oc and i'm planning on turning this design into a shirt once it's finished her name is koha and she's a yandere
if you couldn't tell from the drawing i'll have a full speed paint of this piece up on my channel later but for now i wanted to show um some clips of me actually drawing on the tablet
thank you so much
if you watched this far um let me know if you guys would be interested in more voiceover videos in the future i was thinking i could potentially do like a q a or speed paints where i talk about the art piece
yeah the cursor
we can already see how the tablet looks like right now it is in this protective sheet but I can tell you guys that the size of this tablet is not too big and also not too small that it will not take too much space of your working area which is pretty handy
I haven't actually tried that feature but I'm very curious so I might have to try it on my phone because I actually don't own any tablets something else that I also want to mention which is pretty cool from this tablet that it has got a rotation feature meaning that you can tilt your tablet in whatever position you want and you can still draw with it and it also has got a pressure sensitivity that supports over 8,000 levels downloading and installing
all you have to do is go to their website and select the software you have and just download it and after you've done that all you have to do is extract the file on your desktop and install the driver after your installed
I only changed my Express keys to some tools that I usually use when drawing and I did some little tests on my program which is Medibank and it works pretty well the pressure sensitivity was working pretty good so I didn't really change much in the settings
I'm gonna talk about the illustration that I'm doing in this video and also what I think about this tablet if I like it if I don't if I recommend it if I had any problems with it and stuff like that so talking about the drawing I decided to imagine if ramen was a girl and I lit she drew a girl in a ramen bowl and I really liked how this concept turned out and the whole thing about food and drawing food I just really liked it so I decided to go with it because I already had like this idea from like a long time and but I never really put it
I guess onto paper even though it's not really paper but you get it so I'm really happy on how it turned out and I finally decided to include the sketch part as well and I think I'm gonna be doing that more often since I think it's more complete of a speedpaint even though I know
I complain a lot about the sketching part because it usually takes a long time for me and also because I usually take breaks a lot of breaks because I usually get distracted a little too easily and I don't pause the recording so I just leave it on and I just when I have to edit it
I think she's pretty cute but I kind of struggled with the bowl because I never usually draw food but then I realized that drawing the food is actually so much fun and I should probably do it more often and probably practice and if you guys would like to see more of these kinds of drawings like food reimagined as people let me know in the comments down below because I would love to do more
it's so much fun
I didn't do anything
I wanted to do sort of like a table scenery kind of thing but then I thought that it would take too much time and I was already rushing through the end of this drawing because I wanted to finish it so bad so I just decided to go with a simple gradient background and then I added ramen dreams as a title sort of thing
I really liked how that turned out but I kind of struggle with that too because I made a bunch of different X's and I just didn't know which one to choose so I ended up going with one and I really liked it
I did use different colors because I didn't want it to blend in with the bowl because I wanted the bowl to be the main focus of this drawing of course but I just still think that it clashes too much and it just doesn't fit with the drawing at all so I really don't know I I don't know what
I guess I don't know but if you guys have any constructive criticism it's always welcomed like I said it helps me improve so don't be afraid to do that now
it's pretty cool
you could also use it as a travel tablet because it's pretty small it's not that and I got that small and it doesn't take too much of your working space and for me
that's a struggle so
I'm used to my old one which is thick and this one is legit the same size as a pencil which I don't understand why I'm having such a struggle with this one because I eat
it only works if it is if it is connected to the charger so I always have this pan with a longest cable attached to it which is pretty annoying
yes it's great
you don't have to do anything at all actually so it's pretty cool so make sure to check their website which I'm gonna link it in the description down below for more info about the prices and everything and if you're interested in more the company anyway I really hope you liked this video

i'm terrible at putting on screen protectors and i just wanted to preface the video by saying that so you don't think that's actually part of the device it does include a screen protector
so that's something
it's not too lightweight but it's also not too heavy it does have a usbc port at the bottom which is fantastic for charging when you first turn the device on it takes a minute to load and then you're presented with a beautiful screensaver
the store our notes storage and apps because the cool thing about this particular tablet is you can install additional apps so say you like reading with the kindle ereader
the included
i personally prefer to read an e-ink tablets if i'm going to be reading a book or anything over a couple of paragraphs so if you're like me you probably want to look at an e-reader instead of an actual tablet but what's nice is this combines elements of both
that works really nicely the harder you press the darker your lines are going to be but you can also adjust these settings on the device it picks up on your writing almost instantly so it does feel a lot like writing with an actual pencil the screen protector definitely helps to feel more like writing on paper a lot of options for adjusting the size of your lines as well as the brush that you're using so if you wanted something for art this is also a pretty cool option
it supports the show
we're discussing mooring
most exciting model because it is the ultimate evolution of both the tablet and laptop as one of the newest models the CF 20 is fully rugged and comes with a removable keyboard
it's great for firefighters police officers and military and overall great for those leading a durable lightweight maximum performance laptop tablet hybrid the CF 20 has a great 10.1 inch screen and is only one point three inches thick
LCD screen the CF
the digitizer will still work with your glove but can also sense when a stylus is being used and only detect that making your job a lot easier in getting signatures and handwritten notes the CF twenties primary battery can keep you working for about five to six hours
there's an option for a second hot swappable battery found in the keyboard and hot swappable means that you can exchange your low battery for a fully charged one without turning your computer off
webcam with microphones
there are also options for rear-facing camera or readers like Barco smart card or fingerprints and a whole lot more like every Panasonic Toughbook at boring tech the CF 20 comes with that solid 3 year warranty detailed warranty info more technical specifications and compare and contrast breakdowns are available on the Mornington website the CF 20 is a groundbreaking addition to the Panasonic Toughbook family lightweight convertible and high performance
Waring Tech you
oh and n they also make an 8 inch version and have recently made a video on that but I've had a lot of people ask me to pick up the 10 inch so I figured I'd go ahead and do a quick review on it
the 10 inch version
I have in
this video comes in at $79 and the 8 inch version is 64 performance between the two is pretty much going to be the same because they use the same
we get the tablet
we have our 3.5
millimeter audio jack micro
Android 9.0 Pi and like I mentioned they have the same internal so I guess the deciding factor would be the size of the screen and as you can see the 10 inch version Dwarfs the 8 inch version
Amazon if I had to choose between the two I would go with the fire 10 any day even if I had to pay a hundred and fifty dollars for it but like I mentioned they do go on sale all the time
and it's a base
Android there are five
Walmart apps built in that you can disable and if you've ever messed around with the fire tablets you know it runs by OS - modified version of Android but I personally don't like it so first thing I'm gonna do is go over the specs on the on 10 inch tablet
it's the same
GPU we get 2 gigabytes of ddr3 in the on 10 16 gigabytes of internal storage plus a microSD card slot 802 11 BG in an AC Wi-Fi so you can pick up 5 gigahertz Bluetooth 4.0 2 megapixel rear camera and a 0.3 megapixel front-facing camera
so if you're looking to buy one of these just to take pictures with kind of forget about it a 4000 milliamp hour battery and they claimed 5 hours of battery life and like
I don't think playing video will last 5 hours on this tablet especially at full brightness and finally the operating system Android 9.0 Pi with full access to the Google Play Store there are 5 Walmart apps pre-installed and you can disable them
I'm gonna be running some benchmarks testing out some native android games emulation and some video playback so here it is the tablet is actually pretty snappy and down here we have this little
I have disabled these in the settings when I first booted the tablet up there were two updates that I needed to install and one of the updates included a new security patch from May 4th 2019
you really have no clue how long the manufacturers gonna be serving updates running a quick speed test actually met some pretty decent performance out of the Wi-Fi chip in here
this is the single core score as you can see the on 10 the on 8 and the fire eight are around the same performance they all have the same chip but when we move over to the fire
10 it more than double the score of each of these tablets so with single-threaded tasks the fire 10 is definitely where it's at moving over to the multi-core section of Geekbench the on 10 8 and fire 8 all around the same score but the fire 10
that'll beat out all four of these tablets here but when we take a look at the ten eight and fire eight they are really low on the scale and the final
you will have some stuttering but overall it performs a hundred times better than I ever suspected it would so I wanted to test out a Bluetooth controller with this I opted to try the I pega 98 III
they're about 27 bucks
you can find them on sale sometimes for around 15 but it's an awesome item to have with a big tablet like this and by the way this is the rockstar game bully from the Google Play Store
I can exit the game and I could stream pretty much any game that I have installed on my gaming PC here's some n64 emulation using moopan 64 + FZ from the Google Play Store
Play Store works great
32x game gear
there's thousands of retro games that you can play at full speed using retroarch with this tablet and finally some video playback if you want to stream from your favorite service like Netflix Hulu HBO GO
Cody playing a 1080p
it's really not a bad tablet for being $80 a made by Walmart like I mentioned at the beginning I would definitely opt for the fire 10 if you need a bigger tablet but if you're on a really tight budget this will get you by
the 10 inch
I will leave links in the description but your best bet is to check your local Walmart and see if they have them in stock either the 8 or the 10
it'd be really cool
thanks for watching you
I get I think that this is a really good drawing tablet because of this little tool right here known as the correction tool now if I turn that down to like say like a little number like five and I draw you can see my lines are really messy and it's close to the pen but in my opinion I personally use a higher number because it's easier to do
I always use 40
USD on Amazon
got your 2048 levels
got the stylus pen
I hide my weed
these are the cables
it doesn't have the retractable button at the top but instead has the charging port if the light is red it means it's charging and is that full charge when the light is off
connect the USB to the tablet and computer like before aside from the two buttons on the pen you also have 12 additional shortcut buttons on the tablet that you can program and once you're done drawing you can slip the pen into the convenient pen jacket on the side of the tablet
so now if you can't find your stylus after you used it last time it's your own damn fault and we're back again to the actual usage of the tablet just a reminder before you use this tablet make sure to delete any drivers of previous tablets that you have used before this recording
but there's actually an extra sixteen soft buttons so these buttons are the ones on the tablet on the left side that you can actually press their tactile buttons but these ones are just above the active area of the tablet and if you enable them over here with the enable soft keys you can actually tap them with the stylus on the tablet and it'll apply whatever shortcut you've registered into it so right now these are just the default but I guess just to test it out you can see that number two is registered as B
and for the keys
it's this one
it would definitely save space on my desk if I don't have to use the keyboard seeing as I don't need it right beside the the actual tablet that would be pretty convenient
so that the scale ratio of your tablet will match that of the current monitor that you're working on so have that on so your squares will be squares hit apply and that should be
yeah that should be good to go again pressure sensitivity working as intended good stuff good stuff and I guess now I will be drawing my character as a as a test maybe
I'll draw my head
but you know
so here's the head
I guess I'll just drawn the neck and I'm definitely doing less undos because I feel like my strokes are a little bit more accurate with the size of this tablet
okay let's see
well what face should
I draw mmm
let's try a really tired face that sound currently feeling therefore it'll be much easier to draw because I am empathizing with my drawing sometimes when I like to draw something more serious I actually add a nose in my character but on every other occasion no nose actually when I draw like these really detailed faces and this is like pretty much the only time I end up using pressure pressure sensitivity
I like adding multiple
oh age yeah
it's pretty good
I think the the hardest thing for me are was doing angled lines cuz normally on a tablet monitor you could just you know tilts tilt your head or pretty much tilt the actual tablet like it's a piece of paper and you just draw that angle but on a regular tablet like this you have to just you know stay upright and draw angles the best the best that you can and hope for the best all right
it's beautiful okay
I didn't really draw yours but yeah just I just wanted to test out a more detailed drawing than the last one cuz I think the last one was better for sketches
hey this
it's not flexible
it's pretty much
yeah similar dimensions
you definitely bring less wires because the the Cintiq you need like all the charging adapters and all that but this one is just a USB cable so throwing the tablets or on the cable and you're set
ah thanks pretty good
I haven't really
I pretty much only tried this in tech and yeah the 13 and the 22 and 24 so once again thanks to Gelman for letting me try out these tablets
hopefully this helped because a lot of you and a lot of you are trying to get into more digital art but you have no idea where to start and a lot of the the tablets are there are pretty pricy to be honest and ever since I started
I think the speed of the setup like the driver downloads and all that this is pretty smooth for for this tablet and same with the s 56k so I just that running smoothly and how I've had no problems setting it up
hi this is
and you can use it like a laptop but you can also fold the screen down so that it's facing away from the keyboard and use it as a tablet or prop it up and sort of use it in a tent mode style
it's not the fastest
especially if you're upgrading from the earlier system with Ivy Bridge of Sandy Bridge or something else we've got USB 3.0 full-size SD card slot speaker over here we've got another USB 3.0 port HDMI
headset jack
is this little glowing
guy in the corner here makes sense to have the power button in that position when you're using it in tablet mode because you can sort of just tap it turn the screen on or off
I haven't pointed out
when you're folding a device so the screens back 360 degrees and you're using it in sort of tablet mode like we looked at lenovo has been doing that for a while with their yoga laptops
the keyboard is actually a touch sensitive silicon keyboard with sort of this rubbery texture to it and that means that the keys are there's a little bit raised above the base
so let's go ahead and open notepad and start typing it works reasonably well but I find I miss keys every now and again because you don't have that sensation of actually touching the keyboard and sometimes I wanted up pushing down a little bit harder than I would really like to on the keys just to make sure that I've hit them properly
meaning that it's really designed first and foremost to be used as a tablet but it also has this physically attached keyboard that you can use whenever you'd like now
I have it set up so that I'm using the full display resolution but a lot of the texts and images and other things are set to the larger setting
you can adjust this
it's kind of hard to see anything unless you zoom the heck in it does give you a lot of screen space if you really need it for some reason but so you can run a lot of applications side by side in this mode but it would be hard to actually see what's going on so for the most part you're probably gonna want to go with this larger setting or maybe somewhere in between
where not everything is quite so tiny but it works pretty nicely if you want to do side by side applications and sort of have them show up in full screen so instead of going at the largest text and fonts this is sort of the second largest setting but for the most part I found myself just using the default settings this is how it looks out of the box in terms of performance you can see
what you'll notice here is that certain parts of this application actually looked just fine to the file and the image and the layers and the colors and these menus and everything looked fine
it's more that they're a little ahead of the game here and this is something else that you're gonna see on a lot of newer laptops or tablets that have high resolution screens when you're running
my internet connection has been a little slow here but and you can even run multiple apps side by side here so let's go ahead and load a YouTube video so you can see that word
YouTube and Netflix
we could switch that over to the Kindle application or games or other things doesn't have any real problems running multiple apps on the same screen so overall I'm pretty impressed with the performance of Windows using it as a desktop or as a laptop computer works pretty well other than the keyboard
I've edited some videos
I have no complaints
Dell says I think that you might be able to get a little bit more under some circumstances but in in my tests about seven hours seems seems right and that's not bad for a machine that is incredibly thin and weighs just about two and a half pounds does not have a user replaceable batteries
charger is reasonably compact
gigs of ram
if you're really looking for a tablet you might want something thinner and lighter and cheaper this is Brad Linder with Laputa and a video review of the Dell XPS 11
nowadays most people have multiple devices in the house swapping between them depending on your mood or usage at the time a tablet is one of those useful devices that bridges the gap between your smartphone and a laptop does a dragon touch max 10
fill this hole
thick making a comfortable tablet to hold on for long periods at the rear the smooth back is broken with a lighter grade dimpled bar at the top and bottom
the max 10 has a 10.1 inch ips full hd display at a 1610 aspect ratio the resolution is set at 1200 x 1920 and a screen density of two to five dpi brightness set to low is perfectly usable indoors and outdoors on a grey cloudy day however on a sunny day dialed up to maximum brightness
whether you're catching up with bbc iplayer or playing among us with your friends on the right you find a headphone jack power button volume rocker and a reset pinhole on the top
during testing the wi-fi strength signal was excellent even from a couple of rooms away similarly connecting a bluetooth headset and listening to streaming music was reliable the dual 1 watt speakers are located along the bottom edge of the max 10 not the best place to position
here are some samples
the dragon touch max
10 tablet has an arm cortex a55 octa-core processor running at 1.6 gigahertz this review model has three gigabytes of ram and 32 gigabytes of storage the hardware specs are more than capable of handling day-to-day tasks like web browsing gmail music streaming of spotify catching up on tiktok and using office apps
pi this gives it a positive thumbs up as there's no bloatware to uninstall and gives the tablet user optimum gui experience the one downside is the questionable security updates or even android os updates in the future as the last google security update was november 2019
i won't be holding my breath during testing i played pokemon go useful with built-in gps but no 4g sim slot call of duty mobile rebel racing and among us
here's some gaming footage
end graphical power on the tablet as all the processing is done at the data center xbox game pass and google stadia to name two plug in your headphones and connect a bluetooth controller away
you go the max10 has a 5000mah battery with the lowest brightness set you can get around 8 hours battery life with the mixture of browsing streaming and gaming on maximum brightness expect around 4 hours charging from 0 to 100 takes around 3 hours 3 pros and cons of the dragon touch max
use the max
10 free of bloatware making the max 10 highly responsive and optimized subpar speakers the audio and the max 10 is definitely nothing to write home about poor positioning of the speaker grill at the bottom add to the muffled sound cameras another weak point of the max 10 the front and rear cameras perform badly in the right lighting conditions
no updates don't expect any software updates from the max 10 past android 9 one of the weaknesses of budget android devices manufacturers don't tend to prioritize security or os updates the dragon touch max 10 tablet for a budget android device hits all the main features well enough to satisfy 99 of the customers
the dragon touch max
touch max 10 tablet
thanks for watching cheers
what's up YouTube today
I miss reviews
the charger the charger cord and a two-year warranty card and that's it see that just saved us some serious time now on the device itself as you can see no buttons on that side no buttons on that side and here we go
there's a little hole here you can put something into like a toothpick or paperclip and that will reset it back to stack how you originally got your device on the back
here's our camera
here's a camera light
you have the dragon
I believe and this is your charging port and as you can see it's the old-school one you didn't get the C so that is what we're working with so I'm gonna turn it on
see what it can and can't do and get right back to you all right while we're waiting for that to charge up give you a little more info about the dragon touch m7 tablet this
hopefully it is charged by now and we can jump over and do some benchmarks and check some programs out and see how good this thing runs alright now that
I have some HAP's installed and got familiar with the product and got to customize the way I like I can tell you what will work and what won't work
it's just slow
it's just
that's pretty rad quality
this is another negative
I did a Samsung Galaxy Tab E and it got 1 to 30 and that's like a $200 tablet so just to give you an idea but this is not a good score but we're gonna use it in a real life scenario not just a test benchmark and the hardware is
it's just slow
it runs pretty decent
pandora works great
that sounds just fine
it's pretty cool
that's a pretty cool feature but for the most part people looking for this tablet is probably Kendall or maybe to browse and watch video streaming companies like Netflix Prime video Hulu and Disney Plus and they all work great
this isn't really fast
that was really fast
check out some originals
let's check out who
there you go
Disney Plus
is that you know
you can see
this is tweet
hey what's up
this case does not come off it also has an IR blaster that you can see right there so if you want to use it with your stereo or your home theater system you can
I'm not the hugest fan of plastic when it comes to the design of tablets and phones but it feels pretty sturdy pretty solid considering you don't get a lot of like those creaks when you when you bend the device or anything like that often my complaint with a tablet is that the edges are so sharp that it digs right into the palm of your hands and it becomes really uncomfortable over time so the rounded corners are definitely appreciated
initially that the menu buttons going away and now on to performance which is where the tablet kind of starts to fall apart a little bit dual core processor which some people would say
hey you know
like in the responsiveness
pull down sometimes
you never know what you're going to get browsing the web was okay but again when you're scrolling through a big web page there's just a little bit of extra jitteriness when you're scrolling through and you detect it more and more over time playing games
I play dead trigger
2 Riptide gp2 real racing 3 and overall they were there pretty enjoyable but again just Little Bo jittering and stuttering throughout the gameplay that would crop up here and there that would just kind of pull you out of the experience
I would expect
I did notice that standby time if I left it in my bag for a little while it wouldn't last more than a couple of days standby time actually seemed to not be that great and then of course there's the software which is Samsung's TouchWiz UI
certainly has its fans
I wouldn't necessarily say that I'm the hugest fan of TouchWiz but it really gave it a shot here a multi window mode that allows you to pull up two different pages side by side
stay which actually uses these sensors to track your eyes and if your eyes are staring at the screen and it knows it it'll keep the screen on doesn't matter what your screen time
though like there is on the s4 so keep that in mind and I just have to go ahead and go on the record and say that Samsung built-in keyboard is horrible
I man I you get more wrong than you ever get right with the Samsung keyboard but overall you know TouchWiz brings a certain level of extra features to their devices to Samsung devices
all right
there's the display which like I said 720 display but it's perfectly sufficient and a very nice display considering that some software features that are included with TouchWiz are actually very handy and useful so that gives you a little bit of extra usefulness out of your tablet purchase on the con side
I would definitely say
performance and responsiveness were an issue throughout the user experience and I definitely noticed it more the more I use the tablet and then price compared to the competition you know that the iPad Mini is only
I don't walk away from this review thinking that there's one particular thing that this tablet is especially good at and you know if you're going to recommend it to people to buy you want at least some reason to recommend them to do so if you're a big fan of samsung touchwiz their hardware aesthetic
tab 3 8.0
hi my name's
turn one tablet
it can be quite worrying knowing what your child's getting up to while they're online you set up a profile for the parent you then set up a profile for your child and you put your child's date of birth in the parents side of it is called the curio genius and you actually set different types of restrictions which is great you've got so much control app management pre-loaded ones for their age will come up
then you can decide as the parent which apps you would like them to see or that you don't want them to see going again to your curio genius part and you can say different times every day or you can actually have the same amount of time every day or obviously at weekends you might want to let them have a little bit more time
it's easier what
I like about it
it actually comes with office apps as well so as they get older and they do you know they've got homework to do and schoolwork they can actually do them on here because you've got you know spreadsheets
thanks for watching bye
so this one has a core core i7 uh 8th gen processor windows 10 of course elite x2 and i got the lte lte version as well so that has that has advanced
uh advanced 4g advanced 4g or advanced lte it also came with the um with the rechargeable active pen which i have broken the the tip of there unfortunately it uh fell on itself but um i have uh charged it many times with this port here and it's still working still working through here so it charges um with the usb c connection which is the same as the connection that comes with the um with the tablet itself and it uh magnetically connects to each side
so if we open up the um open up the tablet here it is um i liked the i like the thin bezels that they have um on this particular one which is on the on the g4 model um the previous hp had uh bezels that were about this thick on the left and the right as well so it was a quite a bit of a larger quite a bit of a larger tablet
so this is a detachable detachable keyboard obviously because this is a this is a tablet so you can detach it just like that and then it goes into excuse me it goes into uh goes into into tablet mode um so then um then you can use it for um uh for anything you want uh with the windows
this is actually quite quite a good experience and it has uh bang olufsen uh speakers so the the uh the the audio quality and the video that you get out of this is actually pretty good uh especially um especially considering it
it doesn't uh it doesn't do too good in in in daylight uh in bright daylight unfortunately but um for most for most most users um i i'd say to be it'll be quite good
nits or so
i believe it's uh closer to 16 by 10 um aspect ratio but um overall it's been um it's been a a really um really quite a good quite a good tablet for um for work and quite a good tablet for um for entertainment as well just looking at the tablet itself here
it's got a nice
it can go down to um go down to an angle like this here which is um which is quite good for um for riding with the riding with the pen riding with the pen is is fairly good
but it's not um not something that i would sort of do um every day so most of the time i just leave the pen um attached attached to the side attached to the side there like that so this this tablet has volume volume buttons on the left
uh two of which
um this one is the i7 with 16 gigs of ram and a 512 gig ssd so it is the uh it is the spec'd up is this backed up version of the of the tablet
i'll just pop the keyboard pop the keyboard back on so i can show you guys a few things to do with the um with the with the keyboard so um the keyboard has a couple of different positions
um which gives the keyboard a little bit more of an angle and then it's still fairly solid but kind of um kind of bounces around a little bit when you um when you touch the keys but still very solid as i said before
looks quite good when you close it as well with the um with the with the back of the back of the keyboard here has a um a leather leather hp logo on it and it's all um great leather gray leather on the back there which is really nice
um so another thing another thing i just wanted to show you guys with this tablet is it actually works quite well in um in in portrait mode as well and it's sort of similar in shape to an a4 piece of paper so if you bring it up like this it'll um change the um change the rotation to to appear appear like this and then what you can actually do is just have it down
you can use it as a as a writing tablet actually works actually works quite well in this in this mode or if you're if you're reviewing if you're reviewing a a document documents also look quite good in this mode because it um it fills the screen fills the screen a fair bit more
um so i'll just put the pen over here so so you can see that um you can almost get almost basically get an entire a4 page on the screen especially if you go into especially if you go into full screen uh full screen mode as well
it looks um it actually looks quite good to uh to preview preview a document and just be reading reading a document full size at the full 3000 by 2000 um 2000 resolution uh bang olufsen bang and also speakers sound quite good possibly not quite as good as the ipad pro but uh certainly certainly they do pack a punch and they probably got a fair bit more bass than i was expecting and they sound um sound a fair bit better than my uh than my phone speakers as well which is um which is fairly impressive
um to um to include the new 10th generation um intel processors but um they may be doing something slightly different this year or moving away moving away to go for more of a more of an arm processor but um in general the 8th gen i7 goes alright
it's um you've probably noticed if you have a look at the hp website these are actually very very expensive um it cost about 3 000 australian dollars um when the surface pro 7 uh launched for about 2 000 australian dollars
so it was
and the only real additional thing that it offered is is the slim bezels which microsoft seems to have fixed with their surface pro x although albeit that is a arm-based tablet so that's something completely different kettle of fish and the only other thing that h sorry that microsoft didn't offer was is microsoft
just um just off
but i'm not in um and i'm not in wi-fi not in the wi-fi area but um they were just the the two things that microsoft wasn't quite offering um but i'd say that this tablet in comparison to a microsoft one is um it it certainly um certainly packs quite a punch although you do have to deal with the price
which is a little bit disappointing to be honest because the the specs on this said that it should last between eight to ten hours now i have found on video usage
i expect it actually does last up to about eight hours when watching a uh the video when i took a took a flight the other day i downloaded some some netflix
um on the windows 10 up here and i was watching videos for about four hours and i only used about half the battery so uh by that uh metric
i'd expect it to last a full eight hours if watching video which is uh which lives up to hp's um hp specifications on this but um unfortunately for real world usage like my actual work which is what i bought this device for it
um the battery dies in about um in about three hours and that three hours is on um on battery saving mode uh down here so if i um if i have it running i need to have it running on on battery saving mode um to actually get the full three hours and that actually completely limits the um uh the processing speed and you can really tell that it's that it's limited so it's actually a slow three hours um of battery life so not not very impressed um with the battery unfortunately but everything else about this tablet has actually been fantastic so um i guess kudos to hp for the rest of it but i feel like they perhaps were trying to make it as thin as they possibly could and um unfortunately have skimped on the battery here um so
but it feels um it feels quality um it certainly feels like a quality tablet in your hand especially especially when you uh when you fold it up um with the with the included with the included keyboard
uh differently for this
touch max
10 tablet
because it was so affordable the price tag was so cheap but as i got it into my hand start using it i actually like it more and more and the feel of holding it in the hand actually feels pretty solid
this has a octa-core processor with three gig of ram and a built in 32 gigabyte of storage of course you can expand that up to 128 gig by simply inserting a micro sd card
now again it comes
just make sure you check the safe extra 15 bucks and apply the coupon when you check out and the price will go down to even lower than the 2 gigabyte version itself
so let's take a quick look around the max 10 tablet here so the display as you can see it looks very vibrant and clean especially for its price tag guys so at the bottom of the tablet right here
and i'll show you how it sounds and what the volume is like later now on the front of the screen right here if you look very closely in between the two speakers you see a little dot right here
that way you can insert a headphone in here and listen to your music and be immersed totally and it also have built in bluetooth so you can use your wireless bluetooth earbuds or loudspeaker as well
so it feels pretty solid now the round edges on all four sides i believe is plastic but it does have some pretty good weight to it and that's why it feels pretty solid itself
is it has voice activation and voice command so i can just say hey google what time is it right now and immediately just like that 8 16 am just like that guys
isn't that pretty awesome
so very very accurate and very sensitive and works very well as well so now i installed several games on here as you can see and we're going to test it out in just a second but the first thing i want to test out right here and show you is in settings so if you go to settings go into system and about max 10 so you can see right here guys that this version indeed has 3.0 gigabyte just to answer many of you guys question
why most people say this 2 gigabyte and why some say 3 gigabyte again because this has two different version and this is the latest version with three gig of ram guys
so let's go ahead and uh first of all watch some youtube videos and of course we are going to be watching my own videos so let's go ahead and check it out and as you can see it runs fairly fast and smooth
all right the next thing we're going to do is let you listen to some audio clip and this is faded by alan walker so as you can hear it guys
millimeter jack
that way
you can insert your headphone and you can also connect your wireless bluetooth or bigger speaker onto it and then totally be immersed in your music that way so so far i actually like it and this you can absolutely multitask with this tablet as you can see right here i have youtube open up along with uh chrome and i am also watching movie on chrome as well as you can see right there so you can load up plenty of other movies on your web browser as well and let's see
come on okay
i got one
somebody's behind me
oh whoa whoa
okay hold on
what surprised me is
i was playing these already but the graphics and everything got a lot better and down so you know overall i really think this is a pretty decent tablet especially for the price tag guys very very affordable
that's what i've been using it for gaming and then watch youtube videos and watch movies on websites as well and been sharing with the wife as well as the kids
so let's remove this box and there it is guys so let me try to show you something here so this is my book and back there as you can see
that's my camera setup
i believe this is absolutely a pretty solid tablet for its price range and i do actually like it so oh and i totally forgot to remove this sticker in the back here so let me go ahead and remove the sticker and check that out guys dragon touch looks and feels pretty pretty nice guys and one last thing i forgot to mention is right here
hey guys today
here's the box
the packaging looks simple
mm reading height when your pen gets close it detects even without touching it it has a 1000mah lithium battery and charging time just 2 hours and you can use it up to 10 hours and supports mac windows and android
you need to connect to the cable and you can use it wirelessly on android devices and all the pages tells you the same thing but just in different languages and there's another small booklet a quick guidebook
let's look at this pack here and see what else do we have a standard usb type-c to usb type-a from tablet to pc when you wish to charge and there are one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven so eleven extra pen nibs inside
maybe the machines just went too fast and put one extra in there all right and we have that otg connector for android two types of adapt adapter one is the usb type-c and another one is the micro usb and this tiny little hit is the wireless receiver that you need to plug into your pc so that you can use the tablet wirelessly
keep it nicely
yeah nice and easy
no glove no case if you need it you can purchase online down in the description below and let's try to remove the plastic cover and try to touch with the pen and see how does it feel on the surface and i try clicking those buttons and it sounds and feels pretty okay
same build quality with the deco 01 v2 and you can see here compared to my hand it is even smaller and if we compare to the pan size the height is about the same with the pen and when we draw here that's the sound it produces do and next before you can use it
just connect the provided cable the usb type c to your tablet and the usb a to your pc and it will show the light here in red color that means it is charging and after charge
hold the on button
then there you go
blue light appears then
after you install you can search for the application name pan tablet and the icon with the brush you can customize other functions to those but two buttons on the pen left click right click middle click eraser and etc you can also choose which monitor screen you want to map to and over here
you can drag to manually set the mapping of your table to the screen and clicking the pressure area there allows you to test the pressure sensitivity level and you can even adjust the curve to the likeness of your own drawing behavior at the bottom right settings shows you all those 8 customizable button keys on your tablet and you can set to any shortcuts that you use often for different application softwares
so normally i will
if it has the line will crook and i will also try with spiral lines to see how smooth the curve goes and i will also draw long curvy lines to test out the pressure sensitivity
so let me just draw some characters and see how it feels no lag issues so far even though it is connected wirelessly from the performance i think the connections are really good and it won't get disconnected nor give you any issues after that
now i can use this deco mini 7w to write notes while having classes take important notes during meetings even drawing is great inside microsoft word which means you can also sketch a quick diagram pie chart or illustrate during presentations next
it can't function nicely
here comes the conclusion
can you believe that
yes definitely so let me know what you think about this tablet whether it is suitable for you let me know down here under the comment section below if you like my videos and hope to see more videos like this in the future please hit the like button and subscribe to my channel and also turn on the bell notification button so you won't miss any upcoming contents
so let's go through
what are my expectations on what this device brings to us as consumers and I think on this one particularly I think that taking in mind the prize what you get is quite acceptable and I think it is a great purchase if if you actually buy this tablet for just you know the casual Netflix watch or YouTube
you know not really for powerful tasks as to expect it is under 50 pound tablet here at the UK so you really can't expect a high performance on this one so you know one of the first things that I I didn't really like as soon as I took it out of the box and start you know
and when you when you touch it it it has a feeling of it doesn't glide smoothly when when you put your finger on it so it kind of reminds me of that
I move any further
I just want to let you guys know that the cameras on this one are really poor and I'm not going to leave any kind of pictures or videos of this device at the end of my video when I did a full review
but you know it's it's really not great the back camera to take pictures you really gotta be in a bright bright environment and even then the picture is not gonna look great so you know if you buying it for the cameras
it is quite scratchy
so as you can see about a week's use and it's called you know already a lot of lot of scratches as you can see and yeah so the build quality on this one is not great but having the price in mind
sometimes you buy a device and you pay a lot more money but you don't get a case so you know maybe it's an extra ten or five or ten pounds that you know you're not paying to get a case on this one and it keeps the back quite good as you can see the back is pristine doesn't have any scratches or anything but obviously in the front it's going to be a little bit different on that so moving forward the software on this one is quite good for where you pay you get a stock
it's an Android go edition so you get the gold apps but you can also download some of the normal ones but obviously they will a bit more heavy on the software but nevertheless if you don't over charge this one with games like 49 and you know those those kind of heavy games
they're not great
I will advise to put a micro sd card on this one to try and install apps on it and stuff because what would happen is that some of those apps are going to struggle to function properly because the CPU just can't cope with both things
that's probably what
so for 80 gigs
it's not great
I can go and show you a sample in a bit but I just want to show you how my usual test game runs on this one and you can see how it runs and it does the job
you've always got to take that in mind of the price and I think for the price where you get is quite quite good and as you can see it runs
I will show you
I've used about 28% so I've installed four or five apps that I need module and it's you know I still got about 70% of storage left so that's not bad and I'm not using a microSD either so it's sufficient and so I can we complain on that one too
now let me show you a bit of YouTube so I've put the unboxing of this one and I'll show you a bit of the speakers as well you are topped up 480p
I always say the best placement for a a speaker is at the front of the devices that's why I like the most but you know it's a tiny speaker but it does the job I mean you can hear although if you out and about doing you know your staff and maybe if your child is trying to watch some YouTube on the go it will probably struggle a bit with the speaker but then again I think it's sufficient for where you pay can't complain on that either so overall what do I think about this one
go on
thank you guys
hello youtube today
milagro laptop 7.18 pro
it's a dual core 1.2 gigahertz processor 16 gb storage 1gb ram dual camera with 3x zoom 5 point capacity the multi-touch screen 12 motion sensors and the battery of it eight plus hours
uh here we go
it's completely simple
it is typical 4.2.2
lock screen unlock it
uh just take accelerometer
yes it's working
we have other friends
in the elixir app
the wi-fi location display resolution is 600 by 976 and the one at 174 dpi camera resolution is very low 640 by 480 although the flip card says that it has hd camera and it captures 30 fps
nothing is here
you can see
samsung galaxy tab
you can compare here
we can skip that
the game runs fine
nothing no lag here
it's good actually
let's go back
let's take a look
the resolution is very poor and in the settings we have picture size qvgr vga store location scene mode only these functions here and we can switch to the front cam actually camera quality is same at both sides so overall this tab is good for those who don't want to do anything on the android phone and milagro company is providing us this tab in 5000 rupees at flippedcard.com
it's a gorgeous display
TK let's go ahead and check out these zenpad z10 the box that this comes in again is a Verizon specific box as well as the horizon at the top the a Suzanne pad z10 and of course we get a picture of the device opening the box will automatically see the tablet itself the rest of the stuff in the boxes
I'll explain to you why of course USB type-c 2 USB type a cable to be able or not only data sync connected to your PC but also use it with the break to be able to charge looking over the specification of the hardware
so you're gonna be getting really nice colors just not AMOLED deep but it's gonna be pretty good especially for outdoors a power button volume button on the right side and their protector
if you want to sync up information on the back we have the 8 megapixel main shooter a little bit of a glass panel here and not really functional more of aesthetics the issues grounding and of course the Verizon branding all the way at the body some of the main benefits of using at NUI specifically on the ascent ad is the ability to do to turn it on or to turn it back off
I like to keep it on so I'm going to a double tap and then swipe up this is a feature that a lot of us usually look for and added as a special feature in a lot of our the other thing I definitely enjoy is the ability to be able to tune the display to the color level that I want now by default comes with balance
turn that off you can go to pivot gives it that nice little punchy quality as far as also customizing be able to add the hue and the saturation level to the way you like it
Android 7.0 is tilith current rom as well as August 1st 2017 it does have a built in as I mentioned to you guys as Simba rectly from Verizon so if I go into speed test which is something
I always love to do when I get Verizon tablets or don't connect the devices because I'm just surprised on how fast we ever look at data processing and the fast that has the thing I was able to run on
I was able to get sixteen and two super fast connection super reliable connection the other thing I also enjoy doing here is obviously using this tablet or in jewelry content so this tablet is very functional in the sense of that it's running Android
it has connected applications that you can use while you're at home or on the road and that's really where you get that main benefit here you have the ability of using Wi-Fi at home and of course you can not only that you also have to Bolivia share in your connection whenever you're traveling so if they're sitting in the car you're traveling with friends and family you'll be able to use this shared with your friends so you're using the tablet and join your content and then they'll be able to do the same
Need for Speed
especially when you have it on the tablet because you have such real estate you can enjoy watching this you can be able to enjoy the entire library of course play video
so let's say
Netflix doesn't actually work
let's go ahead and go with settings we'll go then on the left side so you notice that this orient the actual split screen to the level that you want and then
youtube is 1440
that's the maximum
I enjoyed this
so if the sound is always going to be reverberating and coming to you the best experience if you're able to hold it in your hand and put your hand on the right like when you're holding your tablet to be able to enjoy your content
I know a lot of people will and probably try to use them but I'm gonna give you guys a quick front facing and back facing video example of what this tablet can do so
it's not gonna be the best video but the main benefit here is two things a it's actually a decent sensor for a video conferencing so let's say you're using Skype you're using is what's happened
you're doing video conferencing
you can even actually draw over the display when it's off to do off certain applications you have all your connectivity right here at the top including the mobile tethering hotspot you have display notification and the application that
here we need
can we can customize them as well and you can turn them off individually or set them up differently the other thing of course we have battery it does have a 7800 millionaire battery
seven inch display
even though it kind of looks like a fingerprint sensor for all intents and purposes this is a button of course we have camera and we can change the lockscreen widget so those are the ones that we have them
and about tablet
UI is pretty
this is a Verizon branded tablet so you are going to get the Verizon applications you have Cloud messaging plus as well as the my Verizon application not that much blood where overall I think it runs pretty good and of course all the Google Play applications installed out of the box
consumption tablet it has enough horsepower to be able to power any game that you'd like to play on it of course the display would be in the 2k display IPs and it's almost 10 inches
Hulu your online media of course even YouTube and it is optimized to basically get the highest resolution on YouTube as well the one thing I want to mention to you guys is it is running Android 7.0
so if you've ever taken your tablet and left the house and you have a Wi-Fi tablet you realize first thing obviously all online media anything that connects to the internet gets shut off
you're not gonna have that issue not only that you can also share your tablet's connecting with some of the same with you one of your friends your brother for me
so his tablet is a Wi-Fi only tablet this one is an LTE connected so we can both be online both enjoy our online content at the same time and again it's strong enough as I showed you guys with the speeds
most of the things you want to do with it and it is very nice small light and compact so let me know what you guys think in the comments below like and subscribe as usual again
hi this is
Windows 8.1 tablet with an Intel Atom Bay Trail processor you can use it in portrait or landscape mode and you can run a variety of different types of applications including sort of fullscreen
Windows 8 style applications and desktop apps as well so it's a full-fledged tablet that's about the size of an iPad Mini or a little bit larger than say a Google Nexus 7 tablet with a 7 inch screen similar in overall size and weights
maybe a little bigger a little chunkier but if you wanted to you could use it as an application as an inexpensive tablet for Netflix and Kindle and these sorts of full screen applications for watching movies reading books surfing the web and so forth or you could run full desktop applications
it's still less powerful
let's take a quick look around the device we've got volume buttons power button and with Windows 8 style apps a hidden power button just sort of turns off the screen
we just support bluetooth
a mouse and other devices using wireless connectivity instead of USB if you wanted to let's see take a quick look at a couple of apps here is that we've got the Kindle application that handles video just fine it's got a 1280 by 800 pixel display
I find it comfortable to sort of hold this way and and read but because this is sort of widescreen and I feel like it's just large enough to make to column view more comfortable and I find myself mostly reading using it in in landscape mode pretty comfortable to hold but the amount of text I find is just a little bit more comfortable this way but it's nice to have those options so let's say let's go back to the desktop view here
it does not so you have to tap a button to get it to work and that's one of the problems that I think a lot of people have had with this sort of to view version of Windows where you've got the desktop versus the full screen experience so it takes a little getting used to but it doesn't doesn't work think you're gonna have a better experience though if you did audio playing in the background here and this is the sort of situation where I would hit control-alt-delete but and so that's a pretty example of the frustration that you might get when you're trying to use Windows 8.1 on a touchscreen only device now like
I said you can use external keyboards and there will be an external official wireless keyboard for this device but it is not available as of the time that I'm writing this review now
and that's one of the things that helped set this $300 tablet apart from many others is the fact that you can use this pen to do some nice things like and maximize this say you wanted to go to the C Drive and hover
preview different applications
you can do that so it gives you some of that capability that you would normally have with a mouse but instead using a stylus so that's one of the nice things about
the stylist stylist also supports handwritten input and pressure-sensitive input but it's not quite as responsive as some other third-party or some other devices like one from Wacom or n trig so for instance
my handwriting is awful but sometimes it's just not even hitting the screen sometimes it's not noticing when I lift the pen and you sort of wind up with these extra lines so artists people with better handwriting
other might have a better experience and it does support some pressure sensitivity which is nice but it's I don't find it to be necessarily the easiest device to use with a pen
hopping it in is incredibly simple and then you can cover it up and carry it with you and there's a cutout on the back for the rear camera which is nice
but it's definitely a nice device to have especially if you are using an external keyboard you can prop this up and use it a little bit more like a laptop that way so overall in terms of experience it gets about six hours of battery life under heavy sort of traditional windows style use
that's actually not what
I was looking for just wanted to show you that it does have Microsoft Office installed and that comes pre-loaded again a little bit easier to use if you had a physical keyboard but you can type this way it would be easier if you're holding it
you could use this as a replacement but there just aren't as many high quality windows apps for tablet usage as there are Android and iOS apps I would say and in terms of your overall experience using it for sort of notebook or desktop replacement
the screens a little small and the fact there's only one USB port and that's the same one that you use for charging it makes it a little bit difficult to use for those purposes so during my review time with this I've sort of enjoyed using it but I've rarely used it because just for almost any task
hi i'm wazzy
that was uneventful
it comes with a battery free pen which is great for those of us who constantly forget to charge their pens and then think their tablet is broken when it stops working
or if you're particular you can customize the colors as much as you want here's a bunch of stats that you can pause and read for yourself if you're interested and now that everything i'm contractually obligated to say is out of the way let's get into the real review
there's a delay on the button press so if you spam the undo button in quick succession you're gonna have to wait between each press and because the buttons are on screen i tend to second-guess whether or not i've actually pressed them or i'm just waiting on the delay
i hate screen tablets
this tablet changed how i feel about screen tablets for the better and as much as i love this tablet we must toss it down the stairs since this tablet didn't come with the case i had to put this pillowcase on it to keep any shards that may happen intact
it's different for everybody
but i genuinely enjoy this tablet and i hope that if you're considering jumping from a no screen tablet or even directly from paper that you'll look at the galmond pd 2200 with its matte screen and if you're watching this video in november 2020 galmon is having a sale of up to 15 off
i also want to thank my patrons for their continuous support because toxic cure wouldn't be anything without them and i really hope i was recording because i bit my tongue like eight times
they work well and they have very firm thick back when you click on them the USB cable will go to this place here if you are a left and that user you can turn this around so that the shortcut buttons are on the right side and reverse the USB see here to have the cables go up
Windows there is this additional functionality for Windows Inc which you may have to toggle on and off while troubleshooting the wrong software you are using when there is no pressure sensitivity
you should probably leave this as default because the whole drawing surface of the tablet will be mapped to the entire monitor and you can choose to use the pen as a pen or as a mouse when in mouse mode
and this is where you can customize the 12 is go shortcut buttons up here is where you can create different sets of keyboard shortcuts so you can create a set for Photoshop and other set for illustrator or whatever software you use you just have to click this plus icon there on the right side and browse to select app that you so
let's try some curve
so we're photoshop
I have the smooth thing down to 0% so when I'm drawing this I can see that Asia's of the curve they have slight jitter so it's not as smooth as I expected
I mean
now one thing
I notice is sometimes
you can see here there is this sudden thickness increase before it drops down and here at the bottom you see that is suddenly increases the thickness so the transition
let's go up to 50% and see what happens so this is now at 50% and I can still see those abrupt transition but now the curves the ages the March as soon over there
I like to have the smoothing at 20% right now I'm drawing at 300% zoom so there is some pixelation I like to draw this soon because it allows me more control
alright it seems fine unless you are drawing something where you are always changing the pressure then you may not notice that abrupt transition so here with this very simple line drawing it works fine so when drawing
you have to install the welcome into this driver in addition two weeks driver on your Mac OS to get pressure working affinity photo on the Mac works well pressure sensitivity works and this app is quite responsive so no issues here of this
but that's because I'm zooming to 200% surprisingly the thin and thick transition here it's smoother compared to that on Photoshop and there is no abrupt change to the transition from thin to thick
I think it works
it works
MIDI back paint Pro
works really well
it's very responsive
I can see that
there's this like broad change to the thickness as I press down harder and here you can see it goes down properly to a thinner line and then a property back to a thicker line so there is still that same issue that I had on Mac OS
I don't think so unless you are someone who likes to draw with very long lines and like drawing curves so is this going to be an issue and it comes to drawing well
I don't think so
I mean those issues
this is clip studio
paint pressure
it works fantastic
so you have to come into the preferences and click this radio button here or we have in order to get pressure working other graphic software that I have tested are quita Medibank paint
Pro and affinity photo
so you don't have to install any additional work on drivers so when it comes to drawing it performs generally quite well unless you are using Photoshop for some reason this combination of the tablet and flow shop
it's fifty to fifty-five dollars the price will vary depending on where you get it output some purchase links in the video description below as well as links to more details and information about this tablet
thanks for watching
so hello everybody
we have your pen
we have a micro usb to connect from the tablet to your pc devices and the most important and crazy things on this tablet that you can connect them to your android devices your tablets and more so just
let's start baby
they saying
and your pen
okay guys
okay how we see
okay so this numbers and buttons is your choice to just give them a letter and uh control that you want that they're gonna do and that's it so let's explain you now about the smart pen of huion so let's start so guys how we see
it's your choice to make your right tick or thin so if you pull it up so it's gonna be thick if you're gonna pull it down it's gonna be seen so this is all i have to tell you about this huion pen software and let's go to the work area so let's start
okay so one you have the option to change the tablet rotation okay so it's very easy and very better that you can change rotation of the tablet so you have several options to place your tablet two
okay so guys now
i use photoshop
so let's start
we've got
what's in the box
but yeah that's dud
4 pounds 99 pence so it isn't overly expensive and then we've got the actual full manual as well which is really decent considering like you know the de lys or ml the relatives that could probably benefit from that and they wouldn't know how to operate the device or where to find the manual online and so that's pretty convenient and it comes in six languages as well
so that's that let's have a look at the actual tablet itself so we've got an 8 inch device with two cameras one on the back one on the front and I'll cover the specs later on it's made of plastic and it's quite of a fingerprint magnets and that was a speaker as well and so that's that we've got a volume we've got a power button volume down volume up on the side then if I believe correctly up we've got a headphone jack on the very top
and no
but this unit only has a memory card slot so this device can be upgraded up to 100 with a hundred twenty eight gig memory card and the actual internal storage of the device is 42 gigs
that flap is a bit fiddly will take me a while to put it back in place and then we've got the charging point next to it as well and nothing on the side
that's that we do have some sort of a screen protector already on the device itself and then let's crack on with the actual tablet itself so I have to admit that an 8-inch display IPS display
it's actually really nice
nothing brilliant
you can set up timers for certain apps you can block certain apps you can set pin codes for apps and so on so for example if you want your kid to watch
YouTube for two hours
then we've got a swipe pattern pin unlock if we want to keep the contents of the device safe storage like I said we've got 32 gigabytes of internal storage
and can't really tell which one it is unfortunately can't find any details but that's dart schedule power on and off if you want to save the battery overnight if you're not gonna use it overnight you can schedule power on and power off so it's going to turn off
let's say at 10 o'clock in the evening and then power on at 7 a.m. and if you'd like to when it comes to display settings and we can set up for example what's called a display theme so it's like dark mode light mode so it those spots dark mode like in any
so let's have a listen and let's have a look at how it actually looks and then when it comes to the battery life itself we've got a four thousand milliampere our battery
I'm doing now playing void tyrants and it might not last that long but to be honest I have to admit that that battery combined with the 720p and screen and the power not that powerful processor but still pretty decent gives at least three and days of battery life when you watch
so if you're looking to buy a drawing tablet then keep watching because i'm going to be giving my honest review on this tablet including the pros and cons with all that
let's begin the tablet
i love the way
this is packaged
it's just really nice
the first thing out of the box is the tablet itself which is inside this nice sleeve to protect it right as i pick the tablet up i immediately noticed how light it was
and they work great
while traveling with your tablet next thing is the pen nib sleeve which holds a mini plastic bag full of eight pen nibs and the nib clip nib nib clip nib clip ugh
cause knowing me i'd lose all these pen names otherwise next thing is the pen sleeve you can just slide your pen in there to keep it safe but when i tried it it felt like really snug but i think that's just me speaking of pen nibs again
if you're wanting to use this tablet for like a long time long long while then you'll most likely have to buy more just down the line from the store or something
thank you cards
i'm so glad they included it the glove i got fits me perfectly but if you have like bigger hands it might not fit you or it'll be pretty tight or something i'd say my hands are like an average size so i didn't have any issues but uh just keep that in mind next but next thing or some chords you can connect to your tablet next thing are some cords that you can connect your tablet to your device and the drawing pen which comes packaged in a plastic sleeve
really nice pen
once you set everything up you have to go to gaomon's website and download the latest driver for this tablet if you have a driver downloaded from like another company
it was immediately recognized with by my computer and i was able to move around my computer freely even without the driver which is great since some tablets i've used in the past required you to download the tablet driver before being even able to move around your workspace but while that was working i was unable to use my mouse but after installing the tabber driver it worked perfectly fine
so don't be alarmed
everything worked out
you know i can
i'm not sure if it's because my past tablets haven't been the best or if it's just this tablet like a new tablet or something but i can go from the thinnest line to the thickest line of one pen brush stroke which is amazing to me you can go to the settings and change how the pen pressure works too
if you're not a fan of it i only changed mine a bit and even then it's so great when i was trying to test my pen pressure out on the tablet client itself
i have no idea if this was like the fall on my computer again or if it was just the tablet i've seen other reviews and it worked fine for them so i but for me
i'm not scared that i'm gonna scratch or anything i've been using this tablet non-stop for like a week or so i don't know i i can't count and i don't see any scratches on it even if you did manage to scratch it
i doubt that would really affect your artwork since they would be so insignificant that it wouldn't matter in the grand scheme of things all of the buttons on the tablet work really nice
the pen pressure is like the exact same exclusivity paint um but i wanted to try it out on sigh like really bad but i don't have it on my computer so i'm sure it works fine though so don't be alarmed or anything overall
stand like my previous tablets so i can keep track of the pen and the pen nibs better but that's just a nitpick either way i had a really fun time reviewing this tablet so go check it out links are below in the description if you want to buy one
I have been sent another gorgeous little package that I'm very grateful for from a lovely new company called sterling tablet now sterling tablet take orders both on Facebook or by email and will drop links to both in the description box below
or you can just order them for yourself becoming these gorgeous and hard drop bags you get 100 tons of tablet for two pounds fifty which trust me especially judging by
there aren't many people
that I'm gang
this is incredible
it's soft it's crumbly
it's not chewy
it's very sweet like
that is a booster
this is absolutely gorgeous
I will leave a link in the description box below to where you can pick up a bag of this for your so if you're from the UK but outside of Scotland I would especially urge you to try this because there is really nothing else I've ever had
that is like tablet
welcome to moss review
we're going to do the unboxing of dragon touch notepad max 10 plus and then we're going to look at the settings uh we look at some of the videos pictures and we'll just pretty much try
yeah break the seal
keep that there
so we have features you know implants getting started about application pre-install applications connect to a wi-fi network internet navigation connect to a bt device bluetooth device optional connections specifications troubleshooting and contact us
c cable charging cable we have an adapter warranty activate your two-year free warranty now and that's pretty much everything in the box and so we'll be uh looking at all the settings the videos uh pictures uh all the applications and everything that device has and then we'll uh do review so we'll just continue with the says everything next okay so now we're just going to turn on the dragon touch and see what starts up as and what sentence and everything pretty much asks you to do with the sticker before attention please read this instruction carefully before using remove the thin film by grasping the corner of the film and pull it away from the screen
please charge it for two hours and try again to par on press the power button until the screen lights on tap and hold the lock icon slide and touch the unlike icon to unlock the screen
let's turn it on
let's flip this
let's go back to the top and we'll pick united states and we'll press start okay so after i did the network information it pretty much did update and now it's just asking me copy apps data and stuff like that and so i'm just gonna say next
i'll do that later
anything else
let's see uh manage
clear all and so
there's a calculator
we have calendar
see how that looks
play store settings
that's where i want to go sound recorder youtube and yt music so we'll go into settings we'll look at all the sentence aspects of this so i'm not going to go into network because it will give my network information so i'm going to go connect devices and so you can pair it
we have these are all the files that are on there and your auto calculator and pretty much all the basics we have battery so it gives you all the battery information show
here's the brightness level
there it goes
so it has an internal 32 gigabyte storage but right now it's taking 7.46 gigabytes so for all the apps and everything you can free up space so it tells and if you click in them it tells you what games are in there you know other apps file system everything photos
um so it's pretty much a standard has everything that you would expect from uh android 10 and it has all the photos settings everything you could do and we'll just be doing some other tests
uh we'll put game in so we can see if it lags uh youtube so we can see uh how high resolution can go when you watch a video so if it lags or anything
you just never
okay so now
see the location greg
i have already mobilized okay so here we have the gameplay as you tell the touchscreen works very well have no issues with the touchscreen swing quick and responsive zoom in zoom out
now let's see
oh so we've tested
how the tablet works things we like about it might be some negatives um i've yet to find negative so far especially for the price point in comparison to a lot of tablets that i've seen tested
10 has great specs
yeah okay so i just wanted to mention before i do the review that i just run some several tests because people were in the cam that there might be virus or anything that or a chipset that they uh pretty much do track in or malware and i did run avast mobile by super anti-spyware uh and several other ones that are online and offline
so um i didn't find anything and so i don't know if the person was uh navigating the web the you know internet without uh antivirus a lot of people do that
uh anti spyware anti stuff that you know root root kit and all that stuff to uh prevent from uh you know getting hacked or getting your information stolen or stuff like that and uh now
and i just know you know you should always be uh protecting your uh your devices and that's one thing that yeah might be uh you know a little bit of a cost because you prefer the premium to actually protect you
you have to spend monthly description or apply pay for a six month or or one year for protection but um but overall i just want to indicate that uh for people who mention that uh i just got mine bought from amazon
no issues ran many tests no issues and if you're talking about the chipset their software which i've used to make sure the chipset didn't have any issues so um again so
um i make to differ on that you do have to kind of slide it perfectly into the slot if you don't then it won't read it and so and it did take a while for it to format but right here
there's no lag really in watching a video same with gaming everything works perfectly fine also um several things um you'll see the in the video here how the lag is pretty much non-existent also in the gaming and so that's really good about the tablet
i'll give it like a three out of five because the manual needs some um things that need to be inserted like how to remove the sd card how to slide it
just uh make the customer where they have to question it and you know have to research online for it and so that's one thing i would advise the uh dragon touch to pretty much add into the manual or even just do a qr code or a qr scan where you can scan and see a video where is you know presented everything that the actual tablet does and um more thoroughly than i covered it but um pretty much one thing the components i would say i would give it like a four out of five component
quality is excellent
very impressed with it
um one thing
uh more thorough
i mean it feels like you're going to break it when you try to insert it and also when you remove this on how well or how long that will allow me to do that
so that's one thing i liked about it but you know there's certain things that just need to be improved on the the audio um for the tablets great i would give it like a four out of five
there's it's just a great tablet i can see it lasts in a while and i will indicate in the description if that i have any issues with the tablet or if it dies or if for any reason it just stops charging but that's just common with every tablet
that literally died
and so and both of those have many issues with charging and the charging port you know dying so and also it becomes laggy or there's just been many issues so i'm guessing this will have similar
you know
you're good if you get three or four years so but that's something that we pretty much already figured from having tablets for the last thing like eight nine years so but overall i would give this a tablet like a four out of five
it plays games
also you have to be in a stable position to take where it doesn't um like have a ghost in effect or you know like distortion and your picture or video and so that's another issue so but that's common with like cameras any type of cameras so overall i just want to say that this is a great tablet and for anyone that wants to purchase it
descriptions are down below
hi everyone today
pro drawing tablet
hope you enjoy
very simple design
we don't see many details on the surface except for the logo so after we open the voxel says a tablet in package the felt pouch for lips with bending clip and lips inside
jacket and micro usb
the tablet has run a site smoothly flows from tablet level level to table and makes strong comfortable lego tablets also it has 12 express key buttons on the left and 16 space keys on the top
surface while drawing
also when i tested the tablet i made the speedpaint for you enjoy is cause this scene is yes um oh uh actually i've already drawn many things on the tablet but i didn't recall the process in conclusion
i don't want it
oh i is
take from western
don't overthink it
we'll drink it drink
it down yes
we'll drink it
drink it drink
you get a wall charger and a USB cable that's about it plus a user manual and if you really want to they do have a $20 coupon for Walmart books this tablet does use a micro USB cable for charging and it's located on the bottom of the tablet over on the right-hand side
we have a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core MediaTek MT 8163 same exact CPU that's in the Fire HD 8 the GPU is also the same we have that Mally T 720 and P 4 but we do get a little more RAM but it's a bit slower 2 gigabytes ddr3 in the on tablet vs. 1.5 ddr4 in the fire HD 8 for the display
IPS display
out of the box and booted it up for the first time 16 gigabytes built-in storage plus a microSD card slot and I have tested a 128 gigabyte card and it works fine here for the battery 3,500 milliamp hour and they claimed 5.5 hours
that's probably reading books and for the operating system we get Android 9.0 with full access to the Google Play Store and now there is a little bit of bloat built in here
Bluetooth 4.0 0.3
we got those apps
it is all up to date and I'm not sure how long they're gonna be serving those the first thing I always usually do is run some benchmarks so I'm gonna go over those I will be comparing the benchmarks that I ran on this tablet to the Amazon Fire HD 8 so the first benchmark Iran was Geekbench for
all of these scores you're about to see are pretty much dead on with each other now if I ran this a few more times on the on 8 let it cool down it probably could have scored higher or just as high as the fire 8 HD they have the same chipset as for multi-core and Geekbench
although it wasn't by much and like i mention if i ran this several times on each tablet we could get the same score on each of these the final benchmark
I ran was 3d
Android phones
it does vary quite a bit on the download but upload stays relatively the same and by the way this was connected to my 5 gigahertz network next up we have some native
I've also tested YouTube
Netflix loads right up
it's definitely not a high-end tablet but the price reflects that now between this and the Amazon fire 8 HD the 8 HD does get a little bit better battery life and it sounds better but performance screen and everything are pretty much the same
they're very similarly priced
and you never know these could go on sale at Walmart at any time if you're interested in picking one up I'll leave links to Walmart in the description but your best bet would be go to your local Walmart
thanks for watching you
now I've got a different art tablet for you guys this time one that can work on your Android tablets and phones the HS 611 comes in three different colors coral red starry blue and Space Gray
you get the tablet the pen the step replacement nibs and two USB adapters one for your pc and one for USB micro the tablet itself comes with 10 Express keys one of them fangled touch bars and eight multimedia King so you can jump around different programs with them
change your music that you're listening to and all that fun stuff it also has this little fabric loop on the side that you can use to hold your pen
I personally prefer a larger active area so I have an easier time of doing detailed work without having to zoom in so much the pen it comes with this your bog-standard 8001 recognizes
your levels of brush
tilt you know
the Pens aren't interchangeable
anywho we get this
no no the stand comes with plenty replacement nibs and ways of course next to nothing so it's really easy to knock around now as you can see here the Huey on campus
we also get these two USB adapters to use if you want to connect the tablet to any Android device you get us PC version and I micro USB version here
I tested but each one there is no cursor whatsoever that kind of defeats the whole purpose but who knows maybe if I drew on an actual Sun Sun tablet and maybe it would be better now if you want to see what
but here's a link up in the corner there if you want to see that right now though let's dive straight into drawing and see how it works so here we are in animate
CC once again
you've got that whole disconnect of where you're looking until you know where you're actually drawing it's going from a spring tablet to this where it's pretty jarring again but I picked it back up pretty quick
it is a weird sensation though it really is via the pen the pen works pretty fine is it's good but I will note though that I had a harder time
I don't know if it's because of the tablets different or what but so yeah I had a little bit more difficulty controlling the the pressure weight of the lines even with their fiddling around in the driver suite
I don't like them
and it just zooms me and really quick or zooms me out real quick kind of aggravating right in the driver suite though you can disable that so that's fine
it's super lightweight and it can connect to any Android device which is really neat but as I did say before like drawing on my wife's phone and using the art programs there was no cursor representation
I did use with Adobe sketch art flow and Adobe Illustrator draw and not one of them have the cursor like I don't know if it's because the phone is old but yeah I've had difficulty drawing in those programs via hopefully or maybe if anyone else's you know use this on a Samsung tablet like you
the main selling point is this thing is it's small and it's very portable so you can go to like a coffee shop with like a little laptop or surface or whatever and just connect it up and just draw away
it's not bad
it works perfectly fine
Android phones and tablets
I did have a little bit of trouble with the pressure control even after fiddling with a crusher curve in the driver's suite they'll get the job done so no problem really just beware that you will have to put more effort into controlling the pressure than you normally would so three point seven
you get ten
you get a decent pen with 8,192 levels of pressure tilts up or adapted to allow you to use it for the Android devices and it's really portable so yeah I can't really knock it
uh to which
i'm very excited
it is the first tablet that i'll be using by the company so i'm very excited to test it out and i have no idea what to expect so first we'll do the unboxing then we'll test it a little bit and then i'll create a quick painting in it as well so we can truly tell what what it's like to work with it because the tablet is all about that experience so let's see what kind of experience this tablet will bring us
it's beautiful very thin
we have the stand
we have the glove
it's kind of funny
oh my god
then we have this pen holder so i guess you can put the pen here and also here and if we open it up we should see the pen nibs
ah there you go one detached there you go put it back cool and that's how you remove the pen nibs and finally the most important pieces the least fun but the most important are all of the cables so here we have your three in one cable
it has your hdmi port and then the usb one and this is for power you can also use the extension for power and then you have to plug it in
let's look at all of them separately in more detail a short little break to remind you to hit that like button and subscribe to my channel if you enjoy this content and hit the notification bell button so you don't miss any more of my content
alright guys
i found this manual
it shows me to open this up first and then i guess select which one of these i want to be using at and i love when it stands very tall
we have our 50 degrees and i am loving this and i think this part also like falls down so that i can finally put the stand here because it has to stand on something
let's unpack this
i love the design
it's very simple
that are customizable
it's just very simple
um i think it's very important for me because i do love the simplicity of just connecting it to my laptop and not needing to use the power cord but we will see how it goes and if this will be able to just work with the tablet and my new laptop i just bought it so definitely if it doesn't work then you know it's gonna be a problem because it is a new laptop so let's open it up
so here's this cable
and self-explanatory i will leave a link down in the description where you can also download the drivers and install them then i did some basic testing and as you can see i decided to just draw straight lines and it worked so well the pen the stylus picked up the slightest movement so i was able to see the super thin beginnings of the stroke and it was just super cool
um here and there which i wasn't sure about why they were there so i decided to play a little bit with the settings on the tablet itself and maybe adjust it to the way that fits me better and i noticed that there was a difference after i did that because obviously all of us kind of perform differently but this pencil i can tell you the stylus picks up on your slightest movement and if you don't like it you can always adjust it
there was not no weirdness here as well except this one little guide that i wasn't even sure whether or not it was my fault or this stylist's fault i did a few sketchings just to fill out the pen and the tablet before i could start actually working and creating a little painting
the only way to understand whether or not a tablet is enjoyable and works for yourself is to start painting or drawing in a way that you always do because all of our styles and techniques and processes are different for me i don't rely on pressure sensitivity as much for the variety of width or opacity or even the straight lines
the testing is cool to just get started but the most important thing is to fill out the tablet when i actually draw if you want to watch the entire time lapse of this painting many other paintings as well as different digital painting lessons that i've created on my website learn.yourartpath.com people who support me on patreon have access to all of these files time lapses and lessons so check it out a patreon.com or learn.yourartpath.com
want your tablet to have um i haven't set up most of the keys and i just use the top ones for like you know the brush the eraser and then the undo button
i enjoyed it
so if you worked with any other pen display tablet before i feel like you will jump right in and you will know what to do and it will just feel like you know second nature to you
the tablet to your laptop and it should work as a pen tablet now so display is off and i have to look at my screen and then draw on a pen tablet
i adjusted where the stylus is working and it worked so now i was able to continue the painting and look at my screen while i do so and just paint from there which is also super fun and like super cool experience for sure so i enjoyed that a lot as well overall
so you guys
after all the testing i feel like it is a very good option especially for those who are just getting into digital art for one being that you never know if you enjoy pen display or a pen tablet more so because this one is two options you can use it as a pen to slay or a pen tablet
you know
i thought it would be a little bit less comfortable but actually i had a lot of fun so yeah i feel like it's great if you want to take it somewhere with you to go like to work or sit in cafe and draw someone especially if you can just use the usbc cable to connect it to your laptop or your phone if you have enjoyed um you know why not
it's so portable so for sure very cool option for beginners intermediates and those who want to take it with them to travel and thank you so much for watching this video you guys hit that like button subscribe to my channel for more content
This is the XP-Pen Artist 15.6 Pro, NOT to be confused with the regular 15.6 or the 16 Pro, even though the 16 Pro happens to be exactly 15.6 in diagonal - which is the same size as this tablet, the Artist Display 15.6 Pro.
What is the difference?
Pro, and you actually lose the scroll wheel and the tablet stand for a very slight improvement in color quality and report rate - which is how often the tablet sends pen position data to your computer.to
Pull that off.
The other pieces you get: a manual, warranty card, cleaning cloth, artist glove, adaptor cable for MAC computers, tablet-to-USB-HDMI-power cable, USB extension cord, four power plug options for various countries. To use the international converters, close the pins on the main box, get the pin shape you need, and slide it into the closed pins.
The wheel clicks as you turn it and offers a little more resistance than other XP-Pen models, which gives you a better feel for what you are doing with it.
Go to xp-pen.com/download.
Unzip, double click, install.
Restart your computer.
Turn the tablet on.
You can also choose if you want your tablet to show a copy of your monitor (duplicate displays), and you can change whether your tablet is to the left or right of your monitor.
X’s with your pen.
Settings, where you can change the color settings of your tablet, and, if you are left-handed, rotate the tablet screen 180 degrees so you can pick it up and turn it to get the buttons out of your way.
and the scroll wheel.
You’re all set!
Now, for the review.
by how much resistance
The pen supports tilt.
The problem with this is once you activate eraser mode with the pen button, when you click back to the brush it might suddenly seem really difficult to make nice strokes.
Similar problem with Toon
In a way this is nice because you can turn the tablet off and back on again and it’ll work fine without having to restart your computer (an issue I have with my Cintiq), but on the other hand all of the windows over there stay over there.
artwork critiques Photoshop
I was curious to see what other competition was out there and so links of course in the description below if you're curious and Inver card shipping container your going to have a display ready white card box
with some nice artist
I'm not a technical specialist and I'm really just interested in what this is going to be like to use from the point of view of an artist inside you are firstly greeted with a felt material branded slipcase for the tablet itself for when you might be throwing it into a bag alongside your laptop and below
you're welcome then in
white plastic tray is firstly there 8192 pressure levels battery free stylus but has a very firm feeling nib a solid rubber pen pot which is a weighty material that does not unscrew but does grip for pen well and also inside is a folding black plastic
stand with metal arms for using the tablet on a desk and it's very similar to what you might find with some of yawns smaller displays as well then in a further smaller card slot
USB memory stick and then you have a branded smudge guard glove designed to keep your lead fingers free for delicate stylus use while stopping your hands natural oils from smudging up the screen over time and letting it glide smoothly over the surface and then you have the tablet contents and set-up guide which I'm never going to read and then lastly a branded dust cloth for keeping things clean as for that tablet screen itself
it has an overall flat edged slate design in a harder black plastic shell with a fair few silvery plastic buttons around the edge and it looks like it's just thick enough to take some weight so all in all you can expect to get the shelf
ready box
Leeloo Dallas multi cable the 8 K pressure pen weighted pot tablet instructions the spare nibs USB memory stick and then not forgetting for thank you card and the smudge guard glove now
firstly it's worth talking about that all-in-one multi lead which is designed to reduce the amount of clutter for more portable tablets that you might be setting up and taking down on and off again whilst on the move or on holiday
right hand edge
I learnt today that my PC can only handle two screens at once despite having three ports on the back of the graphics card which is why my other monitor is off
protector does give it a slightly textured feel but also gives an ever so slight maddening effect to the visuals which otherwise pop fairly well for 15.6 inch 1920 by 1080p screen sits closely under a flat smooth surface that runs right up to the edges and it does seem to put the tablet design over the ergonomics ie it looks quite good but might feel a little less easy to use
however those screen colors stay consistent at up to a hundred and seventy-eight degrees giving it a very wide viewing window which is great and also the screen feels are very close to that surface resulting in minimal parallax
lovely up in each corner is a grouping of eight dots to mark the placement of some of the very small buttons which run nearly flush along with the top edge of the tablet and Visa in fact Bosco's programmable quick access keys which can be found on either end of the top edge depending on if you want to use force tablet for right over on handed use
the dots themselves are placed on the front as you actually have no line of sight to the buttons when using the tablet and without them your fingers would easily lose which one it might be floating over by touch alone
the clean
but having them on there is certainly better for not at all and along the outside edges near the top you will also find a read says scroll wheel which is boss toes answer for zooming in and out of your work
the top are small enough and close enough together that they seem designed for a younger user or someone with smaller hands as you'll only be pressing them with the tip of your finger and they have very little travel at all now
it is great to have these options available for either hand but worth noting that it's far more awkward on the right-hand edge for left-handed users as you can't quite get a controller style grip around that edge due to those connecting cables but further down that right-hand edge
I did find that
if it does actually make it sit pretty firmly in place on the desk unless you're going to give it a good thorough push and it has two small folding arms at the front bottom in order to support four bottom edge of the tablet and keep it in place first and actually suits of this size tablet perfectly so no complaints but do be careful
if you're adjusting the stand angles was for tablet is on it as you'll likely be peering over the and you don't want to tip the thing onto the floor by accident as it's not locked in place it does however sit there nice and firmly when you press your weight onto it over the screen area without wobbling the stand itself or sliding around which is great as for the
it's got a mildly
textured single plastic body with some silvered ends and as mentioned it is battery free it has a flared area near the NIP for comfort over time when in use and the two buttons on the edge
work just fine now
at all
but this nib might be a bit too rock-solid if you're used to at least a little bit of feedback as you do your work now if we take it out with the nib changer
provided you can see that these nibs run a much deeper than you might find on another stylus pen so it might be but something a little bit different is happening with the equipment inside for weighted
rubber pot is a single thick solid piece so it sits well on the desk and because of its texture it grips for pen and very well locking it firmly in place and also you get that cheeky
Bosto but in fact due to a host program for my raid on graphics card settings getting in the way now this took me a bit of a while to work out but if you have a raid on graphics card in your computer just want to end the program in task manager before installing the driver and following that the tablet worked fine with Photoshop registering for pressure sensitivity straightaway
but you might need to also go into your display settings to set the tablet screen as the main monitor if your mysteriously getting touch screen selections coming up on your main computer screen so in the driver settings menu
which for me personally was going to be control outs as ed for the lead button to be my undo then ctrl alt and shift followed by enter escape save and rotate for the rest of the buttons
which is something
I strongly suggest you make sure is turned on just to stop it from thinking but whenever you rest your drawing hand on the screen you're trying to zoom or move for canvas and you can also go into the settings menu to turn the touchscreen off completely if like me you tend to be happy enough with just using the manual scroll wheels on the side and so there are plenty of interesting bits going on with this tablet but for me the proof is in the pudding so I sat down for an afternoon to draw a simple illustration and get an overall feeling for the Bosto 16 HD and so now I'm just going to give you my general overall opinions well firstly
it's large enough for you to lean into for a long session of work while sitting at your desk with the computer without feeling too cramped and it's also just small enough to pop into someone's bag or some overhead luggage packed alongside your laptop and the fact that it's powered directly via the USB from your computer saves the need for more cables or a separate plug charger now having a touchscreen function that you can easily turn on and off is great but when trying to zoom in and out of my work
I did find it to be a bit clunky and it would often take a couple of attempts before registering my gesture and using that touch function to rotate was even less responsive
but that being said
so that may soon all be smoothed out when it came to using the quick access buttons on this tablet although I certainly wasn't navigating them by touch alone as they are eight
right on the corner and the rotate button at the other end without much fuss only really getting lost in the middle and because it's a mechanical action instead of a touch bar the scroll wheel on the side actually worked perfectly well for zooming in and out of my canvas as for the screen quality
I did find a fair amount of color discrepancy in the red tones compared to my main monitors and I found myself checking on another screen to see how the art looked from time to time
which for me personally made it feel a little bit too and unresponsive if I'm going to be extra picky and it wasn't quite sensitive enough for my lighter gesture strokes and because there is barely any nib travel
there is another thin screen cover layer but gives it a matte finish and a very slight sense of texture compared to a smooth screen and it's also just interesting to note fit in the world of dedicated drawing tablet screens
Wacom that are actually investigating touch screen technology to go along with their tablet stylus pens so my overall thoughts are this with all of the bells and whistles going on with this tablet
very visually exciting packaging
I'd say that the market for this tablet is somebody who's just getting into digital art and looking for their first tablet screen alternatively someone who's just looking to see their money go as far as possible as far as options are concerned as having a quick look at the
I can see price-wise it's certainly undercutting competition of the same size so I'd certainly say that this is a tablet which does for job and I'd recommend it if you're looking for something on a very tight budget or perhaps looking for an ideal gift for a younger person but beyond all of the shiny extras for core thing for me personally is always going to be the pen and screen experience and it doesn't quite hold up against some of the slightly more expensive tablet brands although to be fair
so if you are a serious artist looking to get into digital or someone who's already well versed with digital tablets and just looking to find something that's more portable
thank you to boss toe for sending one of these over for review and again if you are interested for links are of course in the description below so if you have any questions or thoughts on this tablet yourself or any other troubleshooting tips about getting it to operate like I did then get yourself into the comment
section below and of course make sure you're subscribed for more reviews and art stuff in the future because it really helps me out and I'll see you next time take care
let's get started
now all opinions are my own but I do appreciate them sending it out to me because I've actually never heard of this company prior to getting this product and I've had a really good experience with it so far so I'm really excited to show you everything that there is to know about it so that you can decide if it's a good choice for you now before we take a closer look at the actual tablet itself
we've a user manual so quite a bit of information here in a variety of different languages and we also have another little box in here we have a USBC cable for charging and data transferred
so yes this tablet is USB see which is fantastic we have a SIM card removal tool and we have a USB wall adapter so all the essentials to get started so at the moment you can pick up this tablet for 250 $9.99 now
I'm sure you'll agree with me by the time this review is over but I feel like this tablet is very fairly priced considering everything that we are getting here now
another cool feature about this tablet is that not only does it work with Wi-Fi but it also features a SIM card slot and you can put a SIM card in the tablet so that you can get mobile data on it so I know that if you wanted to get that feature with an iPad for example you'd be paying quite a premium and nowadays with so many people using hotspots from their smartphones
but if you are one of those people that wants that feature then it is here for you and that's something that you can't really find nowadays too often with too many other
Android tablets now
looking display makes the tech last t30 an excellent choice for content consumption now we have very thin bezels over all around the front and of course the display is very large at 10.1 inches
SD card expansion
the storage capacity
that's definitely an option
in the backside of the tablet we do have an 8 megapixel rear camera and overall the front and rear cameras are nothing special and I would really just recommend using those just for video calls
I certainly wouldn't take this tablet on vacation or something with the idea that you use it as your primary camera now internally we're getting 4 gigabytes of RAM and we're getting the mediatek helio p7 II processor and this is really where the tech last t30 shines the fact that we're getting a Helio p7 T in this tablet for the price that's being offered at is really credible deal because that actually is a very solid processor you're gonna be getting very decent performance with it and I did run a benchmark test with the tablet and I'll show you the score right now but basically I got an overall score of one seven zero seven to six so that's a much better score than pretty much any other lower end Android tablet that you could buy right now especially compared to you the various Amazon tablets the performance that you're gonna be getting with this tablet is dramatically better
now the device also features either beefy battery at 8000 milliamp hours which is nice to see as well the software on here is Android 9pi so I wish it was Android 10 but to be honest
Android 10 features that you really want anyway and you're gonna have no issues playing content from all the very popular video streaming apps and music apps like Spotify and if you want to go on Instagram on here
pretty good
microphone as well
I'm very impressed with the materials that this tablet is built out of so I already talked of course about the front panel here but I really like the design I like how the bezels are pretty small but at the same time
they're big enough
that it gives you a space to grab onto the tablet but another cool thing is that we are getting metal around some parts of the tablet including the back so this is all metal
and you have to remember too that we are getting cellular connectivity with this device which that also costs a premium to include but take a look at the left side here the tablet we have the dual speakers a noise cancelling microphone and the power button then on the other side
we have these prongs here to connect to a keyboard so teclast does actually sell a add-on keyboard that you can connect to the tablet for an extra 40 bucks now
I did not get that keyboard unfortunately but it looks like a really nice accessory to go with the tablet so you might want to consider going for that that will also provide the display with extra protection as well so it kind of seems like a no-brainer but it is cool that they do
which is kind of strange and we have the volume buttons so this is definitely a great choice for watching video content whether you plug headphones into this or you end up just listening to audio through the speakers
so if you are someone that wants a tablet to use maybe on the airplane for example and you want to load up a bunch of different movies then this is definitely a good option for you
so thanks to that
I mean
I would say that if you're someone that wants a tablet to watch movies or play any sort of videos or you want a tablet to read books off of or listen to music basically any sort of content consumption
those games will be fine so you can do gaming on here too and technically if you buy that keyboard attachment you could use this tablet to write documents and do things like that as well so I feel like this tablet is a good choice for someone who maybe doesn't know how often they're gonna be using their tablet so they don't want to invest too much money upfront but if you end up getting this and you prove to yourself that you're using it all the time and you're getting your money's worth then maybe in the future you might want to consider upgrading to something even more premium such as an iPad or if you get this and it suits your needs completely fine then just keep using this so basically in conclusion
I really find to be helpful because I'm a big fan of just doing a hotspot from my phone instead but it is there for you so if you did want to get a tablet plan from a carrier you can put your SIM card in here and get data and this really is a step up from most other lower end
Android tablets that I've seen so I feel like it's priced very fairly considering that we are getting four gigs of ram and the mediatek helio p70 if those various features were in a smart phone
they're happy with it in general but if you enjoy the video give it a thumbs up my name is Kevin this is the tech last t30 and I will see you in the next video
is here hope
oh no guys
it also has express keys here on the right side and as well some buttons at the top this tablet can be connected to your computer or an android device and look what i found
are there tablets for left-handed people like the buttons are always on the left side from what i've seen mean you can't use your right hand to press on it okay
i'm getting off topic
i guess
just pick the right driver for your tablet on their website and in our case it's gammon m1220 and you're ready to go it also asks me to allow some permissions though
i could just pick what each button does but here i had to match the keyboard shortcuts with each function and i don't use computer often enough never to know all the keyboard shortcuts so it took me a while to figure out how to set things up other than that
everything was easy
the pen works good
i am drawing
so that's why i'm recording it like this and i did not record the whole thing because it's just a lot of me struggling since i'm just not really used to like looking up at the screen like and then drawing not right on it
i really i noticed that when i just usually draw it's i can't make as thin of the lines if i don't reduce the actual size of the brush but with this i can like make really thin lines and make thick lines
i think except that i was just getting confused with where i'm drawing and that's it and i'm just gonna draw something really simple because again i don't want you
it's it's pretty good
don't work if you're drawing with android device but for a computer there are express keys and also like the top navigation bar thing and it's not expensive for a drawing tablet so that's good and you
that's just how
I say it
Amazon for example you can still get the tilt functionality but it requires a bit of a firmware update and I'll link all the details to that in the description down below as well we're on our a channel sponsor and I'm releasing a video reviewing one of their devices however in all of my reviews of products
I cannot give you that perspective however I have used many different tablet devices both display tablets and pad tablets and I feel that does give me a bit of a good idea as to whether a device is worthwhile or what the features that it hits or doesn't quite hit I like and whether that should affect or shouldn't affect someone's purchase
huion in spray
Express keys meaning that there are eight little keys on the device that you can use either on the right or left of the device depending on whether right or left-handed which you can add keyboard shortcuts to such as ctrl Z
I found was kind of surprisingly good in ways that I didn't expect I want to start off by going through my use experience chronologically starting off with the installation of the drivers and setting up and using of the tablet obviously unboxing it's pretty straightforward
there's a few other stock stairs and things such as the USB cable to plug it in the pen the pen holder which also doubles as an S Pen in holder which comes equipped with spare nibs inside but a vise installation and setup is really straightforward as has been my experience in the past
don't get me wrong
I've made entire games and animations with pad tablets it's never really been an issue but I have had to allow for three or four hours to warm up to the device until I was comfortable with it
all right point is it's hard to quantify why this was the experience and you could in theory put it down to just me falling into place and drawing comfortably because I've done it a lot in the past however I do feel like the drawing area of the tablet must be similar to that of a mouse pad where it feels quite comfortable to work within that range of motion plus the surface of the tablet
I don't have very fine calligraphy motor skills but I really felt like hey maybe I should try doing something that would be a challenge to me and requires some finesse on this thing and I wrote the word calligraphy and a calligraphic font
it was really comfortable
I mention this is because I tried drawing one simple character at a small medium and large size just to see how it felt drawing in all of those and I felt like the result and the drawing experience was most comfortable at small and large moving on to the tilt functionality or lack thereof because I'm an idiot when I got to the Statue I was like oh okay so
I wanted to in my use in reviewing of this thing quantify if that really made a difference or not and I couldn't figure out how to use it or if it was in use or if it was even that relevant to feature for digital art programs because I couldn't figure out how to activate it or if it was noticeable or not it turns out that when I installed the drivers I had a program open in the background and I already had the previous versions of the drivers installed which I sort of ignored warnings about it turns out
I didn't really install the drivers I discovered this because I just couldn't find the tilt functionality and in attempting to find it I found an art slat brush program that is entirely focused on tilts functionality called Express II and it sort of shows the 3d rotation of the pen and it wasn't showing any 3d rotation so obviously I knew something was up uninstalled all the huion drivers started from scratch and AH everything clicked into place
I'm kind of glad that I made that mistake because I experienced the device without any tilt feature and then immediately after with tilt enabled and where I previously was a little skeptical or didn't know how much of a difference it would make
obviously starting off with that expressi brush program that I mentioned you can see the entire 3d representation of your brush on the screen tilt and rotation and the actual use of it in the program is obviously a completely different experience
which is obviously what
I think a lot of the tablets are used day-to-day probably have you know the the tilt and rotation and all that stuff in the same way but I think because it's such a small form-factor and affordable tablet
so that's my overall chronological experience over that four or five hours using the device and I want to give you some overall thoughts and impression of course with the disclaimer of it
being a four to five hour use case but the problem is if I am too excited about a device especially if huion sponsored the video it might come across as biased so I'm going to start off with the cons
it's a double click but it adds an extra step and a little area of uncertainty if you slightly move the pen when it presses down it's just less accurate and more minutely time consuming than it needs to be the shortcuts and Express keys
I don't use them so I could take them or leave them but I obviously think it's great that they're there because 8 shortcut keys is useful for people who use shortcut keys
you know
this thing felt great
looks fantastic and the build quality feels really sturdy and clean but the most important thing when it comes to a tablet especially a hard tablet is how it feels to use
you want to be able to sit down at this thing for five to 10 hour sessions a couple of times a week at least and feel comfortable with it and I think this thing takes so many boxes
a tablet for me
I find myself editing and using the laptop because of the form factor if the laptop is better for hotels and flights and all that stuff but every now and then of course I need to draw now in the past and on a recent trip this was what I would also bring with my laptop a mobile studio pro
I found myself through the process of travelling mainly just sticking to the laptop because swapping between them was uncomfortable and the form factor of the laptop is much more
I don't know usable over a long term basis and to my new friend here that I've been reviewing in this video I am going to from now on for most of my traveling where I don't expect to be doing a large amount of lengthy art sessions going to bring this thing along with my laptop and as far as peripherals and extras to bring with it
that's the weirdest thing
having come from a professional animation and game design background and having used so many tablets and needing so many different forms of tablet and drawing utility on the go this thing brings me sort of a new world of utility that

like this tablet that
I'll see you later
I sell ebooks
but yes getting productivity work done on a tablet isn't always as convenient as let's say it is on a Windows or a Mac device now today we have with us the Alcatel a310 now
and we're gonna tell you if it is a great content consumption device kicking things off with the build of the Alcatel u310 it's made of plastic the rear panel however has a textured finish which adds grip to the device
but it's nothing to complain about as it acts as real estate for a grip when it comes to the build you get what you pay for play a YouTube video on full volume and even though the speakers on the tablet are loud the entire device vibrates
we saw the spider-man homecoming trailer on the tablet from the Reds and blues of spider-man's suit to the day and night scenes in the trailer it all looked good on the device
Netflix on the tablet
I can't help but highlight the lack of crispness on the display we've been spoiled by the Full HD resolutions pixel density on smartphones that the 1280 by 800 pixel resolution of the tablet makes content lack crispness for everyday use
ebooks is alright
Lux the display is quite reflective even under indoor lights and that can be a problem moving to the sound the audio from the tablet itself isn't the best when it comes to fidelity even though it is loud
the tablet does have two front-facing speakers for a stereo experience and since they are front-facing the audio is in your face which is good the tablet is running on Android 7 out-of-the-box with a light UI overlay for the most part the UI is stock
the tablet also comes with built-in FM radio which is great as far as customizations on the UI goes you have a bunch of interesting shortcuts at the bottom of the lockscreen these include a shortcut to the Google assistant clock app calendar and camera
it feels slightly grainy
games like asphalt 8 play in a low framerate which doesn't give it an enjoyable experience if you will play games like Farmville or solitaire then you should be fine when it comes to battery life
now if you're someone that's looking for a tablet with a display that is large to watch movies on especially if you're going to be indoors all the time then
yeah you may want to however if you want an overall great experience for about 12 thousand rupees and don't mind a device that is half the screen size are actually a little more than half considering you can get up to a six inch size display for about twelve thousand rupees with a lot better overall performance
I absolutely like it's got a three by two aspect ratios got some features that you find on other devices like say the surface but they've done a very good job in making this business friendly and also really really productive pricing starts at $8.99 for the Intel Core M 5 version goes also core m7
it's got a mini
DisplayPort which is key
you've got a speaker
grille one on the right-hand side full USB 3.0 you have a USB type-c which you use for data transfers also the charging port for this device which is actually pretty nice and again you can see how the profile looks on the back
that's an 8 megapixel camera the ThinkPad logo the little of course blinking icon there and as we pan down with the open kickstand behind that is your micro SD card slot
it's different from the way it is onto the surface line but this thing is still very sturdy now you can actually lay it on and you can increase or decrease the angles
you find on a thing pad tablet you know it locks into place for better type in it's much sturdier you can see the thickness of the keyboard is also not too thick but it has some thickness so that you can actually type well
of course you've got your track button there in the center if the trackpad if your think pod user and you're moving to this and you'll be very familiar and it's a backlit keyboard also so it gives you everything that you need as a user of a thing pad or at least in the business space all together so in whatever working environment you and this tablet does a fantastic job and one thing
it is fast
it is seamless
it's on the right-hand side of the of the tablet and it works very well so you can jump in and do all the things you need to do working on you know articles documents or browsing the web
it's very functional
this is a standard
think back stylus
so there's really nothing too crazy about it but it handles very well and you can get some really good functionality out of it so in terms of this productivity what you get from this is really solid now
battery life is about 10 hours with the ThinkPad tablet which is you know standard affair for most tablets besides you can get up to 16 gigabytes of RAM in total and as I said a terabyte of storage now you increase that battery life also by using one of the productivity modules which is an extra battery pack that pushes it up to about 15 hours of battery life for you so oh and also you can add things like a pico projector and things like that so there are many ways to make this more versatile now in terms of weight it weighs two point four pounds so this is not a heavy tablet but this is something that can give you a lot of productivity and if you're on the go you work on the goalie and you travel a lot and this might be the tablet for you overall
Oh! And also, I just got a brand new mic, so you can hear an improvement in the sound quality and I think it's- What!? Milo, look! Another one. Now I have two!
[Milo] Audience schmaudience.
This one is $650.
and so
let's get into it.
Here we go.
A nice clean box.
Ready, guys? Oh.
Look at that.
Whoa! It's shiny.
Right here.
Whoa, check that out!
That's super awesome.
Now it's connected.
Check this out.
Looks pretty nice.
Look at that!
The colors look accurate.
Look at this.
See those nibs.
That's so freaking cool.
Guys, you see that?
Look at that.
Oh, wait a minute.
It's color dodge time!
Here we go, Sloan!
The colors look great.
It looks accurate.
James, move real quick.
I'll probably bring Milo.
Popcorn, I love popcorn.
You like it, huh?
they're really really noisy
government tablet
he didn't come this
so it's really messy
sorry please sit okay
yes that's really nice
you also have USB yes Pete USB cable USB cable for tablet and we have a cable for recharging the pen and this is a pen and a lid which is pretty cool there are these buttons like I can't make easiest and up
these are really long
it looks pretty
it feels pretty nice
though the pen the panel feels pretty nice what this thing is although we have a manual about how to install the golem on tablet driver and also the this thing and it won't it won't be that hard because so the government tablet driver is the only thing that I installed on my computer and didn't got a blue screen so it won't be that you won't be that hard
it's really good
I think ok
look at my first
I'm not crying their tears so I want to really thank for the calm on table - I'm really thanking for gamma tablet for choosing me to review the tablet and I saw sending to me
okay so okay
let's let's draw something
hello from teenagers
I don't see any a real review of this thing but I think it's going to like really shock the market because you know what it's cheap and at the same time you get a lot of good features compared to the even more expensive ones on the market today so yeah a lot of people would be like huh
react the last time
okay it's got a 15 and it also has the new 8000 ish level of pressure sensitivity and this one it's meant for the high-res so you see the resolution right here 5080 okay and also the response rate is supposed to be faster than the old stuff the old stuff
I see 230
this thing is just a little box white box with no fancy you know the packaging stuff but inside there make sure you check there's the manual and open the other side you will see the space nibs and the oh and this one fake
yeah the fake CD
okay now the stylus looks better than the older version that comes of the small tablet and the the a thirty and such like that they look almost identical with the buttons and the nib but the look overall is improved
okay right here
at the back
they have a hole
it's battery free
it's kind of kind of cheap but it's better than nothing and you can actually store this thing here to protect the nib when you're putting it on the table which
I like okay
just you'd be like
and it's smooth
it's a touch pad so you can do five things swipe swipe swipe and swipe and then you can't like DoubleTap okay so I will show you what I did with these and it makes my drawing so much better and then one two three four one two three four now over the button there is no like there is no very vivid kind of sting sticking up to let you know that
Express keys and also the swipe adding the extra five so that's a lot of features now compared to the hue on that I review before they don't you don't have the Express keys right here
the shortcuts the soft keys or they call but anyway this is already very good now on the side this is what I really like which is the USBC connection and also it a little switch right here that lets you switch on or off for the side right here that touched but touches they have touchpad
I do need my keyboard because I need to use the shortcut keys in medibang and such but this one you do not basically you split it there and you can use right away without hassle now
it's the same pen
I believe but just different look and a new look is definitely one big improvement because I find that the new pen you do have more grip over it and definitely changes the feel of the whole thing
okay for this tablet
you just need to go plug the thing in and it will detect your tablet right away and also you can have this okay and then the a 30 and then this one okay
and you can just pluck remove pluck remove plum remove and it will be able to sense your tablet and change all the settings accordingly when you plug in different tablets which is superb
that is very important at least for me because I have such so many tablet and now I'm like I dedicated this machine for doing you know filming with this kind of tablet via cran
only okay so yeah
I go like this forward zoom in backward ISO mode okay and then when I swipe the right side I rotate the right swipe the left I rotate the left so it becomes super double-click
I grab a color
okay like a brush
I will want to put a piece of paper over it for a little bit more control but surprisingly if I try to like write Chinese and stuff like that it doesn't really have that floaty feeling okay whereas the s 640 problem because like when I try to go like this okay and fast it just kind of like floats and sticks okay
the bottom left side
okay and then
the left side is outside so it decreased and the the right side is increased so I can increase and decrease the brush size without touching the icons on the menu anyway so doing normal like casual art with this thing is definitely very fast and speedy
I really do like it especially I can also use the old pen and then draw with the same kind of feel but like if you have the open and you got used to it you can always swap back to the old pen which is a really nice feature and you know if you have the small tablet you have a spare pen
it's just very good instead of having to like always have to change the pen because you just change the tablet okay so this habit the react a or 50 okay
this is my little first review of it and I will be doing more videos of this tablet for sure to demonstrate to join but actually you know what this is not a drawing review
I need some space
you know but if you only think there's a little bit tiny bigger and consumes the space board okay so there goes the this tablet and can see the size difference between this six inch okay so just like that
okay okay
how many star
I really like that
is it good
let's get drawing
so tablets can be super super expensive and typically once you get one you stick with it for a long time so when gaomon asked me to review one of their tablets
i want to say that gaomon did send me this tablet but it is not a sponsored video so i will be giving my full and honest opinions on this tablet
keep in mind though that a majority of my life i have been a traditional artist and have only really used a vague tablet in my ipad to create digital art so i am by no means a digital pro but this is just the opinions of a tablet from a basic girl who does basic art but all the basic information for this tablet will be in the description
so when you're drawing your hand doesn't get gross wet on your screen and you have a smoother drawing experience an adapter plug that is set to your country that you snap into the power and a little pen stand that also holds more nibs for your tablet as well as a little hole in the bottom that helps you pull off the nib in case you need to replace it
this tablet was super easy and very user friendly for people working with a tablet for the first time or for people like me who are dum-dums and need things simplified
you are the screen
i typically work with is a lot larger so initially i worried that this screen at 11.6 inches might be way too small to work with but if you're upgrading and moving from working on a laptop or using one of those plug-in tablets to this
the screen protector on it does make the colors look different than they do on my desktop monitor so that is something to be wary of especially when it comes to coloring your work but i loved how quickly i was able to set it up and really enjoyed how lightweight it was it
once it was all up and running i set up some of my hotkeys i always need a control z because your girl is constantly tripping over herself and making mistakes so that was the first button that i set up the only thing i will say for setup though is it does not have the little pressure sensitivity curves so you kind of have to make adjustments and then check them out and then adjust them afterwards again if you might need that
if you're like me you aren't sure about setting up anything that has to do with pressure sensitivity or anything like that but luckily when i started scribbling in clip studio paint the sensitivity seemed to be just fine but if you go to adjust your sensitivity settings just keep in mind that it doesn't have one of those typical graphs that can gauge the sensitivity on it so you might need to adjust it a little bit test it out and then go back and forth a couple times but this part really wasn't a problem for me
there was a little bit of an issue with the calibration when it came to clicking on things and there also was a little bit of latency when dragging the lines but it did not hinder the drawing performance at all
i tried recalibrating it
obviously i just felt like clip studio was so much more cramped on a smaller screen and i had to adjust the windows in the program so that i could see the canvas a little larger but overall i liked this tablet fantastic drawing abilities easy setup just a little bit tiny and then it also doesn't have a stand in the back digital art professionals would probably look for something higher than this but for young artists or for people wanting to get used to digital art
i think i would have been just as satisfied until i could find an upgrade later on down the line as of recording this video gammon actually changed the price of their tablet so the pd 1161 used to be to 39.99 but has since been brought down to 203.99
you can get an extra 15 off of the gaomon pd 1161 bringing the tablet down to 173.39 which i believe is worth the price for what you get with this tablet
tablets are going to charge hundreds more so i think the gaomon pd 1161 does the job especially if you're just dipping your toes into digital art for the first time but anyway
they do have bundles
if you scroll down a little bit further onto the amazon page for this particular tablet where for a little bit more you can get the tablet with a display stand or extra nibs in case you need them speaking of that
i don't know why but that was very entertaining for me but i wanted to thank you once again for sending me this tablet doing things like this makes it so that i can recommend other things to you guys or just have more knowledge on different art supplies so that way when people ask me i can give them a good answer
i hope that i can do more reviews for tablets like this in the future so the next time when someone asks me about drawing tablets i can recommend them and give them a decent answer
An Artist 12 tablet.
Oooo, check it out!
Oooh Check it out.
Wow, look at that.
I'm not sure.
You guys ready?
Lots of cables.
I gotcha, okay!
It looks pretty sweet.
That's so pretty.
Wohh! Check it out!
Look at this.
8192 levels of sensitivity.
That is insane!
I like it.
Before and and after.
Ooooo! Look at that!
Oh my god!
Hey guys, welcome back.
Oh my god.
Just an FYI.
Another really cool highlight
Do you breathe fire?
I'm super excited.
Ooo look at this!
Look at this glove.
Isn't that cool?
because you can actually see what you're drawing on top of which does make it a lot easier for drawing and it will increase your workflow so as I said gearbest sent me this so thanks very much for them and at the moment it cost three hundred and seventy pounds which is similar to the Huey on which is a similar size and is obviously way cheaper than Wacom Cintiq
it's a 21.5
I just slightly prefer that and it comes with an HDMI connector and a VGA and USB and charger and a stand which is pretty much the same as the Huey on so in terms of installation it was easy to install
it's when you go to menus as a top corners that you might notice a bit of distance and therefore click slightly the wrong button when you're not used to it but I don't see that as a big problem especially as the difference in price is over 2,000 pounds compared to the Wacom
they seem so similar
wobble as they're drawing straight lines slowly you can see the pen just shakes lightly and it goes away from its target but both critter and Photoshop now have smoothing tools which will deal with this problem
I can't really tell maybe I'm not an amazing artist that would notice these things but I have been using the work on about five hours a day on average for the last month and now I've just gone across to try this ug and I'm not noticing a lot of difference with the pen sensitivity
Wacom is a nicer experience but for the price if I was starting out and I wasn't as serious as I am now about my art and getting a few sort of freelance pieces in I would definitely go for the ug
I'm quite comfortably drawing without a problem and selecting things menus and so forth in critter and I go across the Photoshop and do a bit more just to make sure that it's working in Photoshop as well and it's nice and comfy no real differences in my 3d program I use blender and I've noticed that I get that dreadful circle when I hold the pen down for too long and it's always in one brush when I'm sculpting I get that slightly with my Wacom as well so I think it's a Windows issue rather than anything to do with the UG but it was a pain and I tried all sorts of things to undertake menus and look up different things but nothing was really working and I'm pretty sure again that's a Windows issue and not aug you but it is something to bear in mind if you do a lot of sculpting in blender you may have to find some way around that or find out how to solve that problem also in the 3d programs
I noticed one other thing that when I was shooting around the menus quickly I had to tap fairly hard to select things whereas when I'm using my work home I can quickly tap and there's no problem I think that's just something to get used to rather than something to stop me using it
great value
Wacom if you are a serious artist and you're okay about spending a fair bit of money because you're getting freelance work or whatever or you're just really that into it then obviously go for a Wacom
Sony so far when this default tablet was launched in 2015 and when this video was made the price of the Japanese version was around $150 in Indonesia so whether this experienced d4 tablet is still quite decent or reliable to use today first
let's look at the design the Xperia z4 tablet still uses the omnibalance design of Sony at the time which is a boxy shape with a flat back and curved corners for Moda material made of plastic
the size is 10.1
when low-light condition from the camera fitter are quite complete same as this on the Xperia smartphone for the rear and front cameras capable of recording maximum video at Full HD 30fps even the EAS filter or a steady shot also runs on the rear and front cameras overall for the camera
Xperia z4 tablet uses a Snapdragon 810 processor with three gigs of RAM and 32 gig of storage the first time I bought it the OS that was used was still Android 5 lolli pop but then it can be update to Android 7 nougat
there is a screen mirroring feature where we can mirroring the screen directly from the experience my front on this tablet for multitasking performance and open/close application it can run smoothly and quite quickly yes
but the good things
use like gaming hit is still there but the hot area is just around here and not evenly distributed to the whole body so it is not too annoying when we use it so basically the heat is still there but it's not too annoying the Xperia z4 tablet has 6,000 milli ampere of battery foreign durability
yes out of
hello everyone today
m10k pro drawing tablet
this is a tablet that you need to connect to a computer in order to use it just to give you the bottom line up front this pen it supports pressure and tilt sensitivity
it's accurate line
quality is good
it's consistent and predictable
anyway i'm just going to present to you my findings and you can decide whether or not this tablet is worth the money and at the time of this video
this is usb type
quality is pretty solid
the tapered ends
they are very firm
it's not that straightforward
those buttons can be assigned to mouse clicks as well and there is this switch display functionality which is useful if you are using dual display so that when you use this function you can jump the cursor from one display to the other display and back here you can also use the shortcut buttons to launch apps the scroll wheel here has already been pre-assigned to zoom in and out scrolling and changing of the brush size to switch between those three functions
in the middle of the scroll wheel there will be a label that appears on the screen to tell you what function you are using work area is where you can map the drawing area of the tablet to your monitor
so you'll be able to use the tablet like this with the shortcut buttons on the right side however the cable will be pointing downwards because this micro usb this is not reversible
the cursor will not move so i have to open the driver and then the mac will be able to recognize the tablet so the workaround is to go to system preferences and launch the driver
whenever you start your mac or login drawing performance is similar with the various drone software i have tested on windows and mac os so i will not be showing you all the different software
so it's very easy to draw thin lines with very faint or light pressure and the lines they taper very nicely very gradually pressure sensitivity works really well the transition from thin to thick
it's very smooth
sensitive scroll wheel
it's really sensitive
so you can see the cursor there depending on the device that you are using you may or may not see the cursor so let me just pick a brush okay so this app that i'm using this is concepts and it supports pressure sensitivity so you can see the thin lines and the thick lines and because there is no driver needed to work with the android or the tablet
there is no way for you to customize the pressure sensitivity for the pen and also in a way for you to use the physical shortcut buttons on the pen and also on the tablet the ideal way to use the android phone with the tablet is to have the phone in vertical orientation
in which case
it's very disorienting
when you are writing or drawing another thing to note is when i hover the pen over the active area i do not see any cursor which makes it impossible to write or to draw all right to conclude as long as you are using drawing software on windows and mac os
um it's definitely unpredictable
and the pen
it's very sensitive
i have the tablet on top of my laptop because if i do this the screen is kind of far away so having it like this allows me to look at the screen a bit closer all right so for us 17 i think the pricing is very competitive compared to other brands that i have reviewed before so i do think it's worth the money
I got the smallest version out of the three sizes it's available in the S size is ten point six by six point seven inches out of which the active drawing area is six point three by three point nine inches
it doesn't sound like a lot but it actually works well even with large 27 or 32 inch screens however if you want more precision and freer hand movements you can get the large size which gives you twelve point
one by eight point four inches active area the easiest way to imagine how big each of these tablets are is by comparing them to the international paper sizes so the small tablet is similar to an a6 paper size the medium into us is like an a5 and the large into us has a slightly bigger active area than an a4 paper
the connection is USBC on the that or you can use it with Bluetooth and the tablet charges itself and connected by cable and works for several days after full charge connected wirelessly although the connection on the tablet itself is USB see the other end of the cable is standard USB which works well in many cases but you will need a converter if you are using newer laptops or netbooks
it has an impressive 8,192 pressure levels on both the pen tip and the eraser which is exactly four times as much as I have on my older vegam into us
stand which allows for further customization depending on the type of friction and drawing field you prefer for the medium and large-sized into ass pros you can even buy different texture sheets and replace the drawing surface to make it smoother or rougher compared to the default resistance the design of the new in toast pro is beautiful and really comfortable to work with it has no hard edges and it is made of premium materials like anodized aluminum and glass fibre composite resin
well just like the touch pad on the macbook pro you can zoom pan and rotate in most applications and if they are not required you can easily disable them with the switch on the side of the tablet
I'm drawing but it's very good to have that quick turn of an on option drawing with the Intuos Pro is really smooth and you can easily use it for any type of professional creative work
if you have never used a pen tablet before you have several alternatives if this is an issue for you if you have more budget you can get an iPad pro with an Apple pencil a vacuum Cintiq pen display or you can also get the paper edition of this new viacom
I'm working on
I am very spoiled though as I have both a big Cindy and an iPad pro so I can switch back and forth between various digital drawing modes to sum it up the 2019 into Austria
I ever tried
click on the link in the description or the join button to become a member if you want to work on future projects with us and see the whole design or illustration process live
And there's also tilt sensor sensitivity [too] so with your pen it will actually Adjust the thickness and the angle of [your] lines if you tilt the pen on the tablet as well So really really nice features on this particular tablet
Depending on which application you're in so it will actually show you what the function of each Express key is next to it on the little screen, and if you flip the tablet round then the orientation of the screens Rotates as well, so it works for both left, or right-handed users So really really well-thought-out and a nice nice addition to these new interests for tablets here.
So really really nice
I'm just going to pop that [down] a Second and show you the pen that comes with the tablet you get the pin itself and you also get a holder for the pin
one step further and improving the design over previous generations now prices online start from [200] pound for the small version of this graphics tablet right up to [430] pounds for the large size which believe me is large and takes up a lot
[of] desktop real estate
Now this medium version.
it's 330 pounds and Increasing the creativity and productivity of your artwork and [the] way in which you work is really really superb and this Product has impressed me because I think wacom have really thought out the design especially the addition of these little led screens
I think that's a really really nice feature [if] you want to check out the full details then head on over to Wacom - Europe Com the Url [is] at the bottom of your screen now.

hi everyone today
we're gonna be reviewing the HP pro x2 612 so for more information to skip watching thank you the HP pro x2 612 is really designed specifically for the business users and workers
who would need to do a lot of content creation it comes with two separate parts and also comes with a nicely packaged charger although I have to say and it's probably my only downside here did notice straight away how well fingerprints showed up so I'm not too fond of that but other than that I think has been really nicely designed with the Hewlett Packard hinge logo an HP mirrored logo on the top as I previously mentioned
so it's really accessible
it has up to 1024 levels of sensitivity to give the best precision possible in terms of specs it has 8 gigabytes of RAM running on an Intel Core i5 processor with Intel HD graphics it has a 12 and 1/2 inch 1080p full HD LED backlit touchscreen display with great viewing angles weighs around 2 pounds and has integrated 3G 4G LTE so they can always be connected making it ideal for any business user
it has two cameras
it has all the ports and functionality that you would expect from a traditional notebook on the left it has the power connector a display port USB for charging an SD card reader
when you're just using it as a tablet without the keyboard it still has a lot of supports including a SIM card reader micro SD slot a USB port headphone jack and the power connector
you also have some ventilation which doesn't get to you one but you can hear it a little bit when it's working quite hard but that's to be expected currently available for around 1,200 pounds which for a business professional convertible notebook and everything's too bad the HP pro x2 612 is fantastic for speed connectivity flexibility and security so
hey everybody it's LAN Seidman and I'm always on the lookout for cheap tablets especially ones running Windows and I found this one from a viewer suggestion at the Microsoft Store
for only $79
it's from a company called new vision and this is running with the full version of Windows 10 but it is packed into a nice little 8 inch tablet here that we'll be exploring in this review today but I do want to mention in the interest of full disclosure that I paid for this with my own funds
nobody is paying for this review and no one is reviewing this content before it is posted so take a closer look now at the hardware and I was very surprised with the build quality on this
it does have some bleed through when you've got a solid color on screen and that's pretty common with these low-cost IPS displays but the fact they were able to get a full HD IPS display into something so inexpensive is a pretty good deal and I'm not going to ding them too much on that you got a capacitive home
you'll see the performance is pretty much where it should be with this chipset inside of it it has though only 2 gigs of ram and only 32 gigabytes of storage and that might present some difficulties especially if you want to install a lot of software on it
there's some ways you can mitigate that a little bit and I'll show you as we get through the rest of the hardware here but generally pretty limited but again you're only paying $79 and you have to keep your expectations in check
Windows this is Windows
I did stick in a fast 16 gigabyte card to give me some space for installing some steam games on it and that's one of the nice things about steam is that it does let you install things on other drives including SD cards so I do have a pretty phat SD card in here and I suggest looking for a more premium card with a very fast
you've got a micro
Windows device would I believe it will also support some of the wireless display adapters too because there is Bluetooth and Wi-Fi built into this of course so you can get into some of those other displays if you want to view that without a wire over here you've got a single USB port
USB device into this but it doesn't let you charge at the same time so there really is only one effective USB port on here you can use this to charge or you can plug a device in but not both
so this is it
USB port many of these tablets do this one doesn't but you do get with something that a lot of Apple users don't get anymore is a full headphone jack there which also serves as audio input
looks very nice
although if you are watching online video with a browser my suggestion is to use the edge browser on these low-end devices especially for 60fps video as I found Google Chrome does not perform as well with these devices
I was noticing that when I was downloading updates as I mentioned before those came in rather slowly but also some of my Steam games as I was downloading sometimes would trail off a little bit in the process of those things coming down and I'm seeing similar behavior when I'm out browsing the web
so sometimes the page will render and everything will come in very quickly as it is right now at least for what you would get out of one of these low powered intel chips other times
gigahertz Wireless n radio
it's not supporting AC
it's really really no rhyme or reason to it maybe it just doesn't like the Wi-Fi routers I have here at the house one thing I did notice because I'm running multiple access points here that it was sometimes going after the lower powered access point on the other side of the house versus the higher powered one that was nearby
bench org pedometer test which is a way of measuring how fast the web performance is irrespective of bandwidth and there we got a score of twenty one point four four which puts it right in line with another atom based device
Windows app would install
I can scroll through this newsletter template here and make some adjustments to it and it's not going to be as fast as an i7 based monster but you're paying 80 bucks here and getting very usable performance out of this little tablet here
I've got a review to this down below but generally I think it's working fine especially given that you don't have to pay all that much to get a pretty useful little computer here now
sometimes it does a little less than better but we are running at 1900 by 1200 so I if we reduce some of the image quality and went down the 720p
we'd have a more playable experience but this does give you an idea as to what this little processor inside is capable of doing so pretty impressive performance out of this thing and I'm running the Optifine performance enhancing plugin and you can run theme on this of course because it is a windows-based computer so let's take a look and see if rocket
it just doesn't look all that great but it does give you an idea as to what you might be able to squeeze out for performance on this little tablet a lot of the triple-a titles like GTA 5 and others do not perform its nicely but it is cool to be able to play some modern stuff on this device just in a very low resolution but there are a number of games that do play well on these little tablets
things that are like 10 years old or so so half-life 2 and many of the games from that era actually do have some decent performance on here even at 720p so there are some gaming options for it
these also work very well as game streaming devices so you can connect via steam in-home streaming to your larger gaming PC in another room for example and use this essentially as a remote monitor of that game and that seems to work
okay as well but remember you've got the USB port limitation here so you might be running on battery while your game controller is plugged into the port but of course Bluetooth controller should work fine and on the 3dmark Cloud Gate test
we got a score of 1547 which puts it right in line with other devices running with the same or similar processor in this generation so real good comparative here is the voyeur
Lenovo mix 320 as well now one last thing to take a look at is how well it can handle some higher end video playback so I've got Kodi running here with a blue rey MKV file full resolution and bitrate and it's running just fine on here as it does on other devices with the similar processor
HEV see stuff like this test file do perform okay so I think if you're running stuff off of maybe a mobile phone that some mobile phones now are starting to do HEV C recording
you'll be okay but I don't expect some blu-ray conversion at a very high bitrate and HEV C to work but the raw file from the blu-ray the MKV file
believe it or not the screen does get gummed up with fingerprints a little more than I would like but generally it is better than many of the other cheap tablets I have looked at that
to offset is very limited storage especially when updates come down and there's no room left on the internal storage to install them so that'll do it for our review here of the new vision $79 tablet and this is LAN Simon

now right when
why is that important
.it is important because the packaging really shows you if the company's serious about their products or not it comes with a pen holder with eight nibs inside of it.
whatever you get two
I've used a lot of Huion products in the past and all were mostly with the hassle of charging the Pens every now and then whenever the battery died and they used to die just suddenly upon you.
I kind of missed on my older Huion tablets and it was really good to experience a battery less pen on a Huion product and there have been many products in the past and but this one was the first one which I tried personally and I was so glad that Huyen has finally started making these pens and the surface due to which the pen is battery less due to the specific tablet using electromagnetic resonance technology
click and the bottom click well now it works as E which means earrin and most of the software because there is no eraser on top but really to be super honest with you all I have actually never used my previous pen
I am saying very portable and not absolute portable because there are smaller sized pen tablets available from Huion but if you are as huge as the mountain from Game of Thrones then this size is definitely portable for you
it really felt premium
fun fact
MuBotso lame. human
if you ever forget you are using a tablet to with the mouse and the keyboard and you gamepad if you're using it too while working on Photoshop or ZBrush hahaha
I'm just kidding
and god damn there is a programmable touch trip right on the tablet which you can use with your fingers touch so zooming in and out with this is a frigging amazing experience
she is constantly sketching and painting for her projects and her first impression by working on this tablet's were rock-solid we both love the response so much on Photoshop we both were really surprised
the surface didn't feel exactly like a paper but it was very very close but that also means that the surface of the tablet will be less prone to scratches unless and until you send your pen tablets to fight the world wars of the world where all the pens and their nibs fight together for the ultimate win if those kind of matches exist
gone are the days when we used to easily suspect and feel that there was a certain kind of response difference when it came to competing tablets like back home and other Chinese tablets
and who you on who you specifically has come so far and there's hardly any usable difference which I could feel with this latest tablet which who Yan has sent me to review and which is really good because now we have so many affordable options specially in India where Rock'em has always costed an arm and a leg and a kidney
I have been using pigeon pen tablets for years now and many smaller studios have also been using it so it has reached a stage when there is almost no difference so vacuum is like an apple now in pen tablets where you pay a premium just for the name of it
great you would have no problems with the tablet by sketching or shading or painting or carving stones well not the last one now in the beginning of this video
HAAAA APPLE go work with wacom and those two dongles will work with both of your micro USB and USB C phones see this is how good companies take care of you not by removing 3.5
use it or not
sorry about that.
on my note 9
how your response time and brush sensitivity and brush procedure could be used similarly how we can tweak it on the desktop through the human software sketch in print like a pro or a noob
I don't care just do it before he takes all over us however you can't use any of these shortcut keys on any on the Android devices because they are clearly configured for Windows or Linux because Android is not Windows and Windows is not Android and you can't get everything in ninety US dollars over the years
Huyen has developed a lot of exciting products and this tablet also screams that and it does that by not screaming because if you want to make a point without screaming then just make the goddamn point
the Indian pricing is still not clear to me but I think it will be priced just a little higher than ninety US dollars so even if you get the tablet at around 10,000 or 12,000 Indian rupees with local warranty
which is not an expensive investment when it comes to seek the kind of features of spend tablet provides and the kind of professional touch it has for all the professionals who would want to invest their money in this tablet to create stuff to make stuff on the Android tablets or on their PCs desktops Linux operating systems or and even Mac
leave a comment
so when you have the $79 version it has this lock screen ad so cost 15 dollars to remove that if you don't want to see the ads so it's got the usual fire
OS 5 layout you
so this tablet
it's 13 ounces
right here
also got dual speakers here on the top so one on each side my other main complaint though aside from heaviness speakers they just aren't very loud so we've got the micro SD card slot right here
so it's got more
I mean they're alright
if you have a real camera on hand but and you can use them in a pinch if you want to got some different settings all right so let's switch over to screen capture mode
I got it some folders for the unused stuff since you can't get rid of Amazon's apps you got the recent list right there and then the this like sort of menu bar up here you can switch to the different sections of your home screen
you can also just swipe from left to right to go to each individual section so if you swipe down from the top of the screen it pulls up the notification list here and your quick settings you've got the brightness or one thing
they've also got like those low-power mode in this automatic sub Mart smart suspend so these things kind of help with the battery life so it does have pretty good battery life with a up to twelve hours
there's also a 32 gigabyte model so would have double that so in here where you can go into the application settings menu you can customize some of the different settings in here like the home screen
it's kind of weird
you can turn off like the notifications and stuff like that that they pop up so there's this a document app it's kind of like a basic you know a file manager
you can create different stuff in here different folders you have access to your like your side loaded content in there so it's kind of strange you don't have your side loaded books in your book section but they show up in the document section
I don't know it's just kind of weird totally different than it is on a Kindle so like you've seen in one of my past tutorials you can actually install Google Play on here
it's really easy
Amazon Prime this is where it really comes in handy because you can just download like a bunch of Prime songs onto your device for free and you can also have different playlists different stations
Amazon Prime but if you don't have Amazon Prime I mean you can load in your own mp3s and stuff on here as well and play those in the audio player so it's obviously set up a little bit more for Amazon's content but you these other apps like I got Pandora on here
I like trying stuff so a lot of access to apps you get a lot of access to music and videos and all that kind of stuff on the fire tablets of course this is the Amazon's own app store
so that's cool feature
I can't really show any videos because it'll just violate copyright on YouTube so I mean the video player does look quite well at the HD screen on the Fire HD 8 does look better than a $49 fire because it can't do HD so it does look quite well so if you hold the home button it accesses Alexa
they have an onboard
help guide
one thing that's annoying about the e-book features so you always have to open the book but when you open up the app it never just goes straight to the book so you guys got to do this so with the fire tablets
I just uploaded our separate video for that so I'm not going to go into detail so you can like scroll through all the pages like this and jump to them you can also just sort of open them up and scroll through them this way
you can also use the notebook feature so there's some different stuff on here for rereading that makes your like notes and highlights accessible and you can study different flashcards and stuff like that you can also open up
if you just sit down use it for a while and you can scroll back and forth like if you need to go back or if you need to go forward or whatever so yeah
Ian's Kindles just because of like a limitation with the you know the slower Ian can stuff like that so you got some different stuff with fire tablets like you can change the background color and like I said with the audiobook integration
then you've got like the word wise feature that gives hints about words so some additional features in here like I was saying yeah you can change the background color
the usual kindle features are in here you know you got the couple of line spacing choices a couple of margin options and then we can do the left align on some of these books so yeah the it's obviously not the greatest screen for reading
because it's like 189
there's this find your tablet thing you can use to find it if you lose it like there's backup & restore so a couple of different things in here so in the security options you can turn on the apps from unknown sources so you can install sideload apps so if you wanted to sideload some apps outside the amazon store you got that option
you got encryption
I have all kinds of reviews for e-readers and tablets and mostly e-readers but I cover all kinds of things related to II reading so check out that and e-book reader blog
really quick okay
i did a review two years ago and i've been using that tablet for two years basically every single day to watch youtube when i'm going to bed all right so the box
let's crack it open
all right okay
it's looking good
it comes with the factory screen protector on the front and some plastic on the back as well for protection got the logo there the model number he has this brush aluminium effect
here's this brush
according to the manufacturer
there's the headphone jack
it looks premium
four gigs of ram
basically nine gigs of the storage straight from factory without anything installed let me install a few things for you guys and we'll have a look at the ui as well now talking about the ui of this tablet
not so cold white
those you guys can see it on camera which is good if you intend to use this tablet during the night time and you also have a dark theme that change everything to black which i do like quite a lot
let's have a look really quick at ida 64 so we can see the specs in full of this tablet so starting with the system tab we can see the attack list p20 hd you can see it has four gigs of ram on the cpu tab
it's it's loud enough stereo speakers and you not cover it when you're holding the tablet like this because the speakers are here at the bottom you try to focus the camera
like this you could
let's have a look at youtube which is basically what i do with the my tablet 4k video the lens we were seeing on screen you can see it in real life
i think this
that's the screen protector
the calls are vibrant
i like it
let's play another one
okay guys so
you have it guys
yeah guys overall
gigs of internal storage
one thing
it's a big plus
let's check it out
funny like tricky
it seems well-built
it's USB see
maybe it's just what
it did seem nice
it seemed comfortable
Aeon slip kind of broken away and start their own company so you can see lots of similarities and this is probably the cheapest of those big names so in terms of quality
see the kind of fairly weight without having to look directly at the tablet so you can always be looking in the screen and then feel your fingers on the different buttons
it works well
you could do either
it's really enjoyable
no problems no glitches although there was one tiny glitch in Photoshop but I think that was more driver compatibility - but you seem to get those sort of tiny glitches every now and again
I'll show you here
it's just one driver
if this is your main tablet it would be a problem if you wants to take this somewhere else and use it on my machine and they have lots of tablets installed all those
it was very responsive
there is one issue that you can't program the pen in different programs so if you want the pen buttons differently for different programs that can be a problem for you
I like to have the middle mouse button for blender and then I like to have it the spacebar for Photoshop so if I change the programs and I'll have to and change the pen settings all the programmable buttons however you can change for different programs even the gesture control so all in all a lovely bit of kit
it just seems a tiny bit more responsive the drivers work first time without any glitches and it's about 10 pounds pica which is quite something really regrets tablet of this price range so if I were about to buy a graphics tablet then I would probably buy this one and I think I will update my website soon to make sure that this one is the choice tablet so that's all from me thank you to V for selling this to me
i believe it's been a while and i haven't looked at tablets for a long time but i'm back to my roots here taking a look at the audio cube
i play 20.
the resolution is 1920x1200
it's ips of course
well 4g support with lt band 20 and 28 dual sim gps fm radios here and it is running android 10 and a fairly decent package with actually some okay sounding loudspeakers so in this in-depth review
and it's just in a wrap as you can see there is a bit of padding either side there to help protect it in transit so under here we will find our accessories so there's not really a lot included
here you can see
you can see right here just measured it so 8.3 millimeters up front is a 2 megapixel camera right here and there's a little cutout for a microphone it does come with a pre-applied screen protector
so if that is missing when you buy it it's highly likely you've just been sent a returned unit or someone's actually used it so just take this off now of course down the bottom of the tablet
they're actually okay
the volume of them
there'll be a sample later on in this review and our type c port here for data and charging sadly there is no hdmi out on this then up top
so this is a pleasant surprise to see that it can push almost 200 nits on the maximum setting and there is one little bug though with the slider here for the brightness so down this area on the lowest brightness setting which is very dim which is great for night use
you can see
touch response is great
this was a surprise to me here so normally the gamma would be miles off for such a budget tablet and it is actually looking at it right here spot on 2.2 for the gamma but that's on the standard setting so in the settings menu there is an option under display here for colors and contrast to tweak the white balance and then our contrast itself so i keep it on standard which does look the best to my eyes so a very decent panel now
this is what happens with these cheaper brands as they push out these cheaper tablets but then they don't offer the support with rom updates at all so it will never get android 11 unless someone on xda they will come up with maybe putting a stock rom on this so it is android stock android
very little bloatware
i have noticed that
wise very good
we'll jump in now just a couple of little screenshots that i've taken for some additional information so free space you get about 55 gigabytes remember there is micro sd card support with this one which is great
legends there okay
prime video
in fact netflix
so that's one area
here is our gpu so you do notice this in gaming and there will be a segment on the gaming performance later on you can play all the games out there
the battery life
it's okay so you can get about nine hours of screen on time possibly 10 hours depending on what you're doing so if it's something not so demanding and you're on wireless up to the 10 hours there so it's kind of an average result here now charge
the six thousand milliamp hour battery it does have gps on board so this is good and we get an accuracy that hovers about three to one meter sometimes and six meters
quality is okay
the performance of google play books i think has improved and this hardware definitely seems so much quicker than i thought it might be so when you double tap you zoom in you can see all those details here so when i record on camera you may see these funny kind of lines going this way
you have the option of course to turn this all black and white through google play books and we do have that eye care mode as well if you're worried about your eyesight late at night or whatever so this when even when i skip ahead the unisock 8 core chip is catching up way
any pixels
it's when you look really close you will then pick up on those pixels so great for ebooks and pdf files as i pointed out the gpu in this particular tablet is its weakness
that's its achilles heel so when you game depending on the title it will have very smooth playable frame rate or like this one call of duty on the high frame rate setting and lowest possible visual settings will now and then give us a bit of a stutter here and there so it's not super smooth
it's still playable
of course you can get kills but it just won't have that performance that i think a lot of people would want especially with more demanding games now if you're playing playing a game
it is terrible
it's poor and similar kind of quality recording video as well here but i think this is a pass passable just and i mean what more can you expect for the price of this tablet here
often webcams are overlooked
panel with good brightness
it's terrible really
the cameras are not wonderful the speakers actually turn out to be a surprise here because they are loud they have a tiny hint of bass and better than what we normally get in this category of cheap tablet so fantastic value for money here from audio cube selling for the 120 us dollars about 105 euros
it is playable
you can get your kills but now and then you get a major stutter or lag that could end up costing you the game lighter titles like mobile legends will be playable there and at least that is good to see so for ebooks light tasks everything like that
which often they are
hey dream chasers
let's let's go
and it's double-sided
this is cool
uh i'm not sure what that little mark is there if that's if that's like a flaw or if there's like a it's fine i'm not sure and if you notice those little marks i mentioned are gone
this is so cool
that opened up
i like it
so i was concerned that i was gonna knock over my stylus even more than i do now but as you can see because it's a little bit taller it's actually harder to knock this stylus over than my my wacom stylus so that was actually a nice surprise and yes
i know
i promise you so
the buttons on the tablet are preset to some pretty intuitive functions including an eraser the spacebar so you can move around your canvas easily and buttons that are set to save and undo
while i'm painting i think by default it was set to eraser or something but i really rely a lot on color picking while i paint so i changed it to alt
on the right i did that by choosing 180 degrees under the rotate setting my only real complaint about the hue on driver settings is the fact that you can't set different profiles per program which is something that wacom offers so for example if you wanted to have different settings in photoshop versus clip studio
let's stay professional
so you can flip your pen while you're drawing and erase and the program actually knows and will switch to the eraser for you and it feels really natural and intuitive and i was convinced for the longest time that i could never switch brands
i can't do that but i got used to hitting the eraser button on the tablet and probably by like halfway through the piece i i wasn't making that mistake anymore
so it's definitely something you can get used to and i wouldn't say that it's a deal breaker for people who are used to having an eraser on their stylus which honestly makes sense because most good art pencils don't have an eraser anyway right like you're not using that number two pencil from school to make traditional art with well maybe you are but you know a lot of people are using something
that isn't like that
it has 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity which i believe is standard at this point but it is a noticeable difference from the very first tablet that i ever had which only had like a thousand levels of pressure sensitivity and basically just what that means is when you press down on the tablet a little bit harder it can tell and so your your marks on your canvas are going to be a little bit more natural as as if you were using a real pencil
i've used it's kind of funny to give a tablet props for just like working but i felt like it was kind of necessary to say because it can be such a problem with certain drivers and certain models of tablets so i was pleasantly surprised yay adequate so overall i really enjoyed using the huan inspired ink tablet
if you're just starting out with digital art you can go cheaper but if it's in your budget and you're pretty confident that you're going to stick with digital art
it's also a good choice if you're a professional and you need a replacement or you need something that you're gonna bring on the go with a laptop there's a link to purchase this tablet in the description full disclosure
also as i mentioned in the beginning huon did send me this tablet for free but i was not paid to make this video or to give it a positive review
if you'd like to see more tablet reviews like this one if there's enough interest i would definitely try to make time for more or if there are any other topics you'd like me to cover
all right
it does support
they're so charged
C cable in white
I can cover that
I think it's one of those omni vision ones and you'd use your mobile phone for better photos anyway but it can at least take photos of text and documents and there's also a LED flash just a single one there so along the side here this is on the right-hand side they've labeled which I don't particularly like it's a little bit ugly when they do this so you can see we've got a mic here
it supports two nano
there's no static
the loudness is good
I've heard phones
doesn't really feel cheap
the power button
it's not bad now
the glass is 2.5
there's no creaking noises
it doesn't feel cheap
the build overall it is a solid well put together tablet now the thickness of the tablet is eight point five millimeters that is actually very good and it weighs well a typical kind of tablet
that's causing this
but the accuracy worth the touch is good but just be prepared to as you can see swipe a lot more to get to the bottom of the pages here now the screens maximum brightness is good
it's 320 lux it's a fully laminated panel but a step down in resolution and quality as well from the previous models here so if I quickly just go into display tester just bring up this image here for some reason
it's flipped around the other way you can see we've got a decent panel and I think most people will be very happy with it but if you're really into your displays and very fussy about them like I am then you won't like this
the lowest brightness sitting
that's the lowest so when you're using this at night you're using this for example on a flight on a aeroplane which in some movies you're gonna find it a little bit too bright now you can get around this
the gamma is coming in at about 2 if somewhere between about one point about 1.9 I would say it should ideally be 2.2 but this is normally off and especially on cheap Chinese tablets
okay so even when you multitask you swap over to other applications you get the occasional little stutter but overall this performance what the ROM is just so much better
you can see just thing so that when that came in all right now it's good it does feel a lot smoother than the previous but it's still not as fast as the qualcomm powered tablets that I've reviewed so these are our stock applications here that you'll find when you first boot up the tablet note that we do have FM radio
you will not see
as well
Widevine level cert 3
hey Leo X 20
let's take a look now at our 4G speed so you're gonna see approximately 20 megabits per second download but it's all gonna depend on your carrier but this is kind of standard here and no problems with the reception signal
is that good
so if you're stealing your neighbor's wireless you won't be added to it with this tablet because the range of found as a standard kind of like four or five rooms away from my router and then the speeds plummet
GPS works well
this surprised me
mediatek doesn't have brilliant
okay no how do we compass however so if you want the best kind of GPS navigation you want to go with a tablet that does have a highway compass like the galaxy s5 Eve for example would be my pick now there
it is again
so you can see
calls call
quality seems fine
it's like a normal mobile phone and so I believe you'll be able to get up to 12 hours depending on your brightness of this so that is the definite strength here of the tick
battery life
surprised me okay
just a movie clip
Terminator 2 get down
so there's an improvement there but I'll give you an audio track as well so you can hear that some bass is actually coming through yay finally a bit of an improvement here with tick last speakers all right so what about ebooks and PDF files
I'm looking at here
see it's playing a little bit of catch-up they're loading things in but their performance is a lot better than the hell yo x27 in the previous models as you can see
here's let's take a look at text or there's a little bit of text here so zoom in now that looks alright but we'll take a look at an e-book
lists of course is just what the screen in its normal mode but you can swipe down from the top of the menu at the top here and just simply put that into the reading mode to remove the blue light and that'll be a lot easier so Amen text actually looks good
this is where we see a massive improvement here in performance because right now on the high settings at 60 frames per second if this was the t20 on the old halle or X 27 this would be choppy
it almost feels like we had double the graphics performance even though the increase isn't that much now occasionally you will see a few little tiny micro starters a couple of little pauses but it is overall just so much more playable so much more fluidity here and the heat okay
so we'll get warm to the touch but it's not gonna cook itself it's not gonna heat up and burn you or anything like that and another demanding game here this is called a julienne
where did he go
I've seen this game running because remember this is just a mid-range low-end kind of chip but the main thing is you can get the kills and it's on the high settings that moment here so you could even lower the settings a little bit too perhaps low
performance is good
I don't have any issues by the way with my touch response here or ping times ping times on the European server also good and I'm not seeing any noticeable lag okay
they are bad okay
and that is it
pubsey quite choppy
you probably couldn't actually do with the previous gen one because it would just be too stuttering there and this because they've got a little bit of bass to them so they are improving their finding listening in those areas
dual sim support
GPS support FM radio
that build is decent
I would say anywhere above 10 hours and in gaming I game for 30 minutes and I lost 5% it was on a lower screen brightness but that is excellent
Netflix and Full HD
ok you want to get something a bit more premium something from Samsung like the Galaxy s5 II would be my choice but of course that cost close to what 400 us double the price of this one
the wireless is ok
it's good it's been excellent at my house but here in the studio that if I go out the door here I've noticed that the wireless range isn't the best
I know I've been focusing a lot on mobiles because there's not a lot of tablets but I will have a Windows 10 core m3 the 8100 Y powered Chewie you Book Pro in the channel probably next week
I'm running for dear dear child to drop that one off to me hopefully tomorrow so I'll see you then back in the channel and thank you so much for watching
ThinkPad x1 tablet
it had this kind of base with an active fan solution and it was totally over engineered and we got to give a little credit for trying to really hard not copy the surface pro design so the second generation got a little bit more normal and had a kickstand kind of design at twelve and a half inch display
not so much then
one of the other
Y low-power CPUs
which is something that they can do now that they have the bigger chassis here and also because Intel's eighth generation CPUs are really very good when it term in terms of power and thermals and all that sort of thing and they can ramp really low down and then they can go go back up the idea being that it's not going to overheat the chassis
so part of being a surface pro competitor and the good part for a lot of people is that 3 by 2 aspect ratio display for those of you who like having more height for webpages and that sort of thing
it's it's really enjoyable
granted that does mean black bars when you're watching video but for productivity that 3x2 really rules so it's a 3,000 by 2,000 pixel display supports both pen and touch by the way both the keyboard and the pen which is a Wacom a EE S Pen are included in the box
so you can't upgrade it and you can get a PCIe nvme SSDs and m-dot to the usual sockets are slotted SSD you can see the rest of the specs on screen and then the charming thing with the ThinkPad x1 tablet is you can actually open it up
selling point vs surface products that are glued together so getting inside is just no fun and it makes sense because thinkpads our business line products and those are supposed to be serviceable by your IT department
I've seen some literature
tablet 8.9 millimeters
is you know who loves to give you these little removable plastic things that stick into USB a ports and it acts like a little inkwell where you can put your pen
well this one
it's very rubbery
put them together
ThinkPad x1 yoga territory
almost in terms of weight at that point that way does afford you some durability though you know it's a thing pad so it's past 12 mil spec 8 ng tests shock vibration dust moisture those sorts of things
the glass is Gorilla
Glass on the front face to give you a little bit more confidence also in terms of durability in terms of performance you can see the benchmarks that are gonna fly across the screen
it's a four core
CPU inside of the performance is good one thing I'll know just like with the other recent thing pads that we've revered the x1 carbon and the x1 yoga you can see that the CPU and particularly the celluloid PC Margate is chess
it's really maintaining
that boost strongly which tells me that they're doing some nice power supply their management and also that they're doing a little probably a modest overclocking the CPU to keep that otherwise the graph would look like this for the core speeds on so
that's pretty good stuff
you know that sort of thing so that it's really well done and in terms of performance and heat so how is the Wacom aes digitizer that included pen and the writing and drawing experience
it's quite good
well because you feel you have used for a separable tablet it's lighter it's more nimble it's easier to handle that speaks for itself if you think that that's a useful thing instead of using the 360 degree yoga hinge and having a hefty thing with the keyboard facing out the backside will yeah the other thing is also the three by two aspect ratio which is pretty nice
nice but there's no
sealed is glued together
you've got to send it into Microsoft if it needs any sort of repairs which can be a little bit discouraging obviously if your IT departments buying it they would much rather have something that they can service the keyboard if you're not a fan of the type cover I personally do like it but it does sound a little bit hollow it has a little bit of flex to it well
so so
Pogo pin connectors the
that you've got the kickstand in the back it's gonna dig into your legs that little metal Ridge and as can be a little hard to balance on your lap compared to a traditional laptop there is no Windows
so you're probably not gonna be putting cards in and taking them out all the time because it's a little bit of a fiddly design so they did a good job of really competing with surface pro in terms of display quality
brightness 396 nits
this is a crazy
bright display
it's a kind of glossy sort of display but enough brightness to combat that all the metrics on this are good the contrast the gamma all of that sort of thing
Photoshop edits that sort of thing about five-and-a-half to six hours of use which is minute since it's USB sea bass charging you can use other USB C charges with it
they have to be at least 45 watts though but that shouldn't be impossible and there are some USB C battery packs even that can output that much so there you have it that's the Lenovo ThinkPad x1 tablet
change here
this guy just really just keeps moving on with the and that's a good thing what I like about is the large display and the whole experience is pretty mainstream it is the size like I said about 13.3
inch ultra bug
yeah you can rip off this keyboard cover right here and have just a tablet so that makes it very versatile for those who can do a lot of note-taking or who do art obviously
that's the selling point versus something like the ThinkPad x1 yoga which no matter what you're going to have the base attach is much more heavy unwieldy kind of thing
yes but there
it's kind of annoying
you can win
i only hukum seen tech guys and i paid 900 euros for it and that was the cheapest at the time so when they contacted me and asked me to review this
i got really curious to see if it was any different from the one that I own and I was just so curious in general so let me introduce it to you
this pen display tablet as an 11 point 6 inches working area the IPS screen as a resolution of 1080 dpi and it has a 72% NTSC color gamut which is very nice and it means that it can reproduce colors in a more accurate way so the colors look more true to life
unfortunately this tablet does not come with a stand but they're developing one that it will sell separately in the future but it comes with a stand for the pen and a really cool glove with only two fingers you know
it's easy now
I've been using an iPad 6 generation for five months now - I don't use that we procreate and I be only using that for the past five months like only that so I definitely love it and I got used to it so much
I was so confused that I didn't know where to start so I definitely approach this painting in the most random and brown way possible because I couldn't even remember how I used to paint digitally on Photoshop
I don't know about you but for some reasons every time I use my computer to paint digitally I always zoom in way too much and so of course I started doing that
I made a huge mess because I forgot to look at this illustration as a whole and I just focused too much on the details and that that's wrong guys so I made a mess and I was trying to fix everything by using the liquify filter who can relate to this like everyone
I started to hate this because they didn't know how to fix it anymore and I seriously thought about deleting everything it's not a new thing but then I didn't really want to do it
no other things so
that's why everything looks kind of weird to be honest but I did all of this to test the tablet and I needed to finish this painting to put it in this video so I definitely got an idea on how this tablet works and it works pretty well sometimes
the pen is not super responsive but it happens really rarely now in case you're wondering yes drawing on an iPad feels completely different than drawing on a display tablet
I think that's mainly because of the difference in the Pens the Apple pencil is more precise to be honest and it is heavier and it doesn't have a tip that moves like any other tablet pens but to me that I was used to normal tablet pens
it was very difficult to get used to it at first and I definitely hate to use the Apple pencil directly on the glass because it feels very weird and I don't really like that but now that I could use that anakata screen protector
I am personally among those people that think that using an iPad as your own main professional device is not possible because the iPad still have a lot of limitations and you can't use powerful programs on it so it's even though the experience of drawing on an iPad is really cool is not enough to be used professional especially if you're a designer if you do digital paintings it might be enough but then it all depends on the level of proportionality that you need and on the size of the file that you need because on a iPad you can just use huge files instead with a computer with a tablet connected to it
it's different from the
Cintiq that I own
and here's the thing
it's not that different
it's useless because that stand doesn't even stand well and all that's required from a stand is that it stands but it doesn't so it makes me feel really anxious that
I'd never use it anyway all I'm trying to say is that okay the 13 HD as a bigger screen compared to this and yes it is a little bit better in the way it's built and the pen feels a little bit more responsive but it definitely is not worth the price in my opinion because it's just a display tablet
if you have any questions about this tablet feel free to ask them in the comment and remember that this is a giveaway and you can win a tablet so if you want to participate leave a comment
what's up everybody tony with itech check and today we're going to be taking a look at the kingpad sa-10 by vasking it's a 10-inch tablet running android 10. it has a 1920x1200 ips display
i will be putting a link in the description in case you guys want to pick it up yourself and if you guys like me and you want to support my channel please use that link because it helps me keep purchasing products to do reviews for you guys so here
we have the tablet
it's not super heavy
we have our two speakers our headphone jack and our usb type c with a little microphone and then on the top here we have our expansion slot for an sd card so build quality as of right now seems really good like i said it's got that aluminum unibody design
this does also have 2.4 and 5 gigahertz wi-fi antennas go ahead and take a look at the display here it does not have a brightness sensor so when you adjust the brightness it will stay at whatever you set it to and i have it set uh 200 percent right now you can also turn on dark theme which makes everything a pretty much dark in the system settings it also has a touch gestures which i also love so you can just swipe up to go home
i haven't installed anything
it's got your gps
if you want to use a security it does not have tap to wake either so if you want to wake it up you need to hit that power button at the top like i said i have touch gestures enabled so you just scroll back and forth
pull it up and it gets in your mouth and it's just it's kind of annoying so this company reached out to me so let's do a little bit of web browsing here
so here is google
i just googled
we'll just go ahead and click on something here and like i said it's got those touch gestures so if you want to go back you can just swipe to the right and it'll take you back to the screen which is nice again
we're inside and you can still see everything very easily so for indoor use you can usually get away with about 50 brightness and still be able to see everything very easily especially
i've put asphalt my favorite pub g in call of duty and we're going to see how well the tablet performs with that so we'll go ahead and load up some asphalt
okay so here
look pretty good
and this is on the highest setting that we can put so we go into settings here and we go into game settings go into sound and display as you can see the quality is on high and that's the best that we can do so we'll go ahead and play that and see what happens so the game is definitely playable on this tablet and again the graphics are set on high
that's the highest it'll go hd or greater it says the option will be available soon so we can't play that right now so the most you can do is balanced with a medium frame rate
there was just a tiny bit of lag but i think that was from the connection rather than the tablet not being able to handle any of the graphics i knocked him out so the graphics aren't horrible
because i guess pubg won't let you put it any higher now whether that's because of the the gpu on here or what it just it is what it is but if you want to get your pub g fix you can definitely play it on this tablet so here we are playing a little call of duty
okay so here
when there's sufficient lighting but as you can see in the christmas tree picture there was less light and the picture was more grainy and pixelated battery life on this tablet
what i did for my test was i charged it all the way up to 100 percent then i streamed youtube videos for as long as the battery would hold out and i got about nine hours of screen on time
which isn't that bad
the brightness was also put to 50 percent because most of the time for your viewing 50 is going to be good for indoors and of course if you raise it to anything higher than that you're gonna get less screen on time as you increase the brightness so after getting to use this tablet for a little bit now i definitely notice a little bit of lag when you're scrolling through the main screens here
it doesn't seem to do it when you're in your settings it seems pretty smooth pretty smooth when you're in your settings here but when you're on your main pages there is definitely a little bit of lag scrolling through that so that's just something to keep in mind and that is also with basically no bass background tasks
the lag is most likely something due to the software and i'm sure that they could probably affix that but as far as my experience goes right now this is what i'm seeing so another thing about the brightness
it's definitely bright enough for pretty much anywhere inside but the brightness definitely cannot handle outside light especially if it's in direct sunlight if it's not in direct sunlight you will be able to still see the screen a little bit but if it's in direct sunlight you're not going to be able to see the screen at all so as far as my feelings on this tablet for the build quality
it's good material
it's a solid tablet
sound is definitely loud
quality is okay
it definitely has a very good picture but i guess my biggest cons for this tablet are definitely going to have to be uh with the the lag that i experienced and the lack of capability of the gpu
but other than that
it's definitely going to be a very capable tablet for you so again i will be putting a link in the description in case you guys want to pick this up yourself and if you guys like me and you want to support my channel please use those links because it helps me
this video is going to be a bit long so if you want to save some time you can actually check out the text review that I have already written
this is the USB data cable on this and this USB C will go to the tablet on the other end the USB type a port this will go to your computer or to your Android phone
XP pen has included this two adapters one has USB type-c port and one has micro USB port so my phone uses USB type-c so with this I am able to connect it to my phone if you are using computers that only have USB type-c ports you will need to use this as well so it's great that the USB adapters are included in this package we have the artist glove a cut to show you where to download the driver and also the Quick Start Guide and this is the pen case
this is extremely solid
the grip is this huge piece of rubber which is really comfortable to hold two side buttons here the build quality of the pan it feels really solid even though the whole thing is actually made of plastic
it's just nice
so this is what
if you want to save some money you can actually go for the small model which still has a very comfortable drawing surface area the price on this medium model
here we have eight physical shortcut buttons and this wheel here which is really smooth so you have to be careful not to sort of turn it when you are reaching for the shortcut buttons because it turns really easily and right in the middle here
this is very interesting
there is actually lighting low so once you connect the cable you can see is blue lighting which you can turn on or off or adjust the brightness which is pretty cool when the cable is connected the four corners that define a drawing surface area
it's really nice
so you have to go into system preferences security and privacy privacy to give permission to the pen tablets setting and pen tablet driver anyway all these instructions they have a dedicated button here
once you click it
this is nice
if you are a left-handed user you can turn it at 180 degrees so the physical shortcut buttons will go to the right side on the next tab here the monitor
I leave this as default because I'm only using one screen right now and if you want to change the brightness of the lights on the tablet this is where you can do so there is the wheel LED and the tablet LED and
Left we have the 8 keys that you can configure and these are the predefined functions that you can choose from if you want to set a specific keyboard shortcut
define this is where you can enter your own keyboard shortcuts or use that button to launch an application on your website or assign a mouse a button to it and there's this trackpad mode switch
which allows you to switch the functionality of the trackpad so sometimes you can have the will to work like a mouse trackpad or you can have it to zoom in and out or have it to change brush size and here on this drop-down menu
I can have it scroll up and down or maybe just assign it as a mouse to use it as an but if you use a lot of different software you can actually create a specific set of keyboard shortcuts for all these buttons for maybe photoshop for example
it's very light
it's also very smooth
it's actually quite good
it's really sensitive
as long as they take her really well and a transition from thin to thick it is also really smooth if you are using Mac OS and you are considering getting a tablet
it works really well
this is on
and now it's on the top side and I can have the darker shade on the right side as well and also at the bottom so sensitivity works pretty well and now I'm using Krita on Windows so early on I'm that I had some issues with Krita on windows more specifically I wasn't able to get the precious sensitivity working that was due to the driver that I installed from June 25 so with that driver from June 25
I wasn't able to get the pressure working the driver that I am using right now it's from June 12 so on XP Penn's website where you can download the drivers
Krita is actually the one from June 12 so everything works fine now and kills sensitivity works as well the last app that I want to show you is clip studio paint on the Mac
if your pressure is not working you may have to change some settings in the Preferences so when I first use clip studio paint with this tablet pressure wasn't working so I have to go into the Preferences the shortcut is ctrl
it's working well if you still find pressure sensitivity not working with clip studio paint or with other drawing apps you can turn on or off windows ink from the XP pen driver on Windows
once you have pressure working it performs really well so the only issues that I have on Windows is with Crete are actually it's with the version of XP pen driver that I was using and also with clip studio paint where the preferences may need to be tweaked
when the pen is close to the drawing surface the cursor will appear depending on the app that you are using orientation here may or may not match their horizontal orientation of your tablet so we've add flow it seems like I may actually need to turn this horizontally so here it doesn't match the orientation of my tablet
I've just rotated the 180 degrees so that the cables go to the left and I've also rotated the tablet so that it matches the orientation here so let's draw something now pressure sensitivity works by default
so that's pretty cool
this seems reasonably accurate
now one thing to note when you are drawing is when the cursor is on the screen there is no way to pinch and zoom to zoom in and out but once you lift up the pen you can zoom in and out you can also rotate basically you can do all the finger gestures but when you have the cursor on the screen you won't be able to do all that so it will take some time to get used to drawing on your phone when you will need to navigate
I wasn't able to change the rotation so when it's like this that have is actually upside down and I want to use it like this because I want the cables to go to the left side but I'm not able to get the rotation to work so I have to use it like this and of course this is going to interfere with the tablet because the cables are all here
this drawing app called deco draw is a free app from XP pen you can download it from the Google Play Store when you open it up the first time with a tablet connected
and when it's connected the mouse cursor actually becomes a tiny little dot so let me just pick a brush and draw something here so pressure sensitivity works pretty nicely here
no issues here now
this app that
I'm using now this is sketchbook on Android so if you feel like it's more comfortable to draw the phone vertically you can have that tablet vertical as well with another brand of tablet that I have tested when it's connected to the phone it actually just maps a portion of the drawing area but here you have access to the food drawing area so this app is sketchbook and pressure works really well
it's excellent lines
it cut buttons to wheels and the driver works pretty well with most of the wrong apps that I have tested except for clip studio paint on windows but even for those two software I was able to quickly resolve the issues by uninstalling the driver and installing another driver and also tweaking the preferences so no major gear breakers overall
this is us $129
so that's all for my review today if I have any updates I will put that in my text review and if you have any questions do let me know in the comment section below
thanks for watching
my unboxing and review of the M 106 k pen tablet from goemon so just as it's climate or the cost of the product and shipping worth covered by the lovely folks over at
I say about a tablet will be my own honest thoughts and opinions so let's get started box turtle it comes in is very simple clean and professional-looking which I like so it's promising to see when companies put that extra bit of effort and just gives their products a high quality kind of feel everything limit and we come straight to tell it on top
just the right amount
the pen comes in a protective cap which you obviously need to unscrew before you use it and when you do you get a nice pointy tip right here next up
we had this cute little pouch quite a thick material with a Velcro light kind of feel you had the gamma logo at the back and a button clasp at the front where it opens inside you will find for extra replacement pendants which you can insert into a pen when the current one has warmed down and also the circular silver thing which
there's a helpful instruction booklet inside explaining everything what everything in the box does finally on the left side we have another container and this one holds all the cables
so make sure you have one of those and also we have another cable and this one is for charging your stylus yes depend us need to be charged before you use it but i remember reading on the site that once is fully charged
here is the interest pen as you can see the stars from gram on is quite a bit thicker and rounder but both fit quite comfortably in the hand so your preference for thicker thinner pens is completely up to you
I'm also going to show you a side-by-side comparison of the intro art with the gallon tablet and this isn't exactly supposed to be a fair comparison because they're quite different products if I were to give a Wacom equivalent of the Galman tablet it will probably be the Intuos Pro which has a size and appearance quite a bit more similar but anyway since we're comparing tablets I also have my 13-inch Wacom mobile studio pro and as you can see size-wise they're pretty similar except of course being a display tablet
I did a sketch with a tablet as well but they're recording for that for so I can actually show you guys that but we're just gonna stomp jump straight into coloring right now
okay so usually
feel like when you're drawing onto paper and I don't know about you guys but I find that haptic feedback really important when drawing it sort of helps bridge that disconnect between your hand and the screen they can often get with pen tablets
there are always some bugs too when you for a start but then somehow over time they just kind of fix themselves or maybe just stopped noticing or adapt or something so
we made some progress
I'm actually quite liking
I did get some issues with the pressure sensitivity like sometimes it would just disappear and I couldn't figure out why if it was a program or the tablet driver
do have the options to customize all the Express keys at the side and at the top of your tablet here so like against that one to control set for undo redo zoom in zoom out color picking etc and
this is great if you don't have a keyboard close by or if you have some really complicated shortcuts are too annoying to do on the keyboard all the time they sound really streamline your drawing process but since
I wouldn't be able to remember which ones which unless I actually stuck labels on each of them so once the pen pressure thing resolved itself as you can see
the brushes and colors were all laying on by themselves and really really nicely just like any other tablet would okay so overall what did I think of this tablet
a solid b-plus
and it's perfectly functional
post if you want a clear written out review for the tablet and also some additional links to the cowman website and places where you can purchase it so a huge thank you to the folks over at gammon for sending me this tablet review
this is the
I don't know that's probably something I should have checked before I hit the record button but this is not a sponsored video so as usual all of the opinions here are my own
it's not too big
Goldilocks size and generally the specs on this pen display is the same as it is on all the others in this price and size range we get a full HD display 1920 pixels by 1080 pixels
the colors looked really good when I plugged it in and has a 94% Adobe RGB and I didn't have to color correct or do anything like that after I plugged it in there
if you do want to fiddle with the settings the pen that comes with has 8,192 levels of pressure sensitivity and the display also has shortcut keys along the side
this is often referred to as parallax the distance between where your pen tip is and where the cursor appears on the screen underneath it the only 16 inch display
Huli on products
latch on it
works pretty well
there's a nice divot along the side so you can get your finger around it and kind of get it out easily and if you're one of those people who's always losing their pen but not me
I never do that
it is pretty light
it holds pressure
hooks on those lines
I do get some jitter on this pen both on Mac and one of drawing on Windows even when I bust out a ruler to reduce some of the natural shakiness of my hand is definitely noticeable now on a lot of the things that I review
so today's question
why not
it had good color
I love the fact that there's more competition out there now than there ever has been the poor so one more person or one more company entering the arena is a good thing in my book so if you have any comments or questions let me know down below in the comment section that is all I have for today thank you guys for watching this video and I will see you in a couple of days
I'm going to be reviewing today is going to be the XP pen star zero six wireless tablet and this tablet was sent to me by XP pen but as always this is going to be an honest review
and then the actual tablet the working area has protective sheet on it as well so it's very protected when it arrived and then there's a bag underneath that that contains the pen the wireless USB receiver a little thinking out with a bunch of languages on it it also comes with an artist glove which I didn't open because I never use artist glove for tablet other than display tablets
it also comes with an extended warranty if you want to follow them on some of their social media they'll give you an extended warranty and then there's also the driver manual in that sleeve and it shows you how to install it your tablet and any of the things that could go wrong how to fix those things also in the Box
there is the pen holder with the eight nibs in it and then there's also the USB charging cable for the tablet so this tablet has six shortcut keys and it has the rotating dial and all of these work very very
I don't know use Express keys at all just because I'm very used to using my keyboard but these Express keys work very well very smoothly and I had absolutely no problems with them as I was using them and so the drawing tablet has a drawing area of 10 inches by 6 inches
but it's not cheap
so this tablet is a wireless tablet and it can be used when it's plugged in with the USB cable as well and so you can use it when it's charging or just wirelessly and it will last up to 16 hours on its full charge but then it takes about two hours to charge completely in your computer so I like it because you can still use a tablet when it's charging when it's plugged into the computer
and if you have any problems with the wireless feature you can always still be plugging it into your computer using it that way as well so it has kind of a versatility to it
so it's a very good pressure sensitivity on this tablet and the two other things are you can customize the pressure sensitivity based on how hard or have frost you press on the tablet in the tablet settings like you know the driver settings and all that and then also this tablet you can flip it over if you're left-handed like me
I just flipped it over and you can adjust that feature in the settings as well so I've set a bunch of good things about this tablet and I do really like it
it's not very natural but yeah this one is a grip is really good on the pen since the pen has this textured plastic and it feels very nice when you're working with it
there is a downside
Rivest tablet and so it could just be my experience but I did try to fix this problem in a couple of ways and it didn't really work so I'm just going to explain what the problem is
I'm going to show you on the screen what I mean by that so I would have recorded this screen as I was showing you the real-time footage of what I mean by that
the lines are not smooth but my computer is relatively slow when it comes to recording in real time and so the lines would have been choppy and it would have been lag
I'm trying different kinds of marks and strokes and it's not very noticeable but a lot of the lines that I make don't turn out smoothly and it's kind of annoying because obviously your tablet needs to be smooth and it makes its lines but like it's icky when I'm trying to draw a circle or something there are going to be these little kind of sharp edges like diagonals that are formed
it's not completely smooth
I'm not 100% sure but I don't see why it would do this if I was using credit because the pressure sensitivity works well everything else works well except for this clients movement so I don't think it's Krita usually Krita supported anyway by most tablet brands
so you know
but when you're professional looking for good tablet for commercial work you do need to make bigger paintings like because of printing and advertising all that kind of stuff you just need it to be a very big size
please check the description to see if there's any updates on this whole problem with the smoothness of the lines if you're watching this a couple of maybe weeks after
I posted this video
it was kind of bothersome working with it because I would have to erase some of the lines that I wanted to be smooth but as I said working really closely
it feels very nice and the pressure sensitivity is awesome and it will probably work well for you if you use smaller file sizes and so this tablet is $89.99 on Amazon and for the price I think this tablet is worth it
the lines move
I'm not a hundred percent sure cuz my computer's a driver that amusing so by the way if you're wondering I have tried to reinstall the tablet driver a couple of times for this
Krita is not compatible with this tablet which I don't think it's because of Krita so I'm just letting you know it's not like I'm an idiot and didn't try every solution to the problem if I could find it but yeah I think that this tablet apart from the fact that the smoothness is a little bit off to kind of bothersome you can see on the screen you know you can tell if it would bother you or not if you are more like an amateur and a beginner and you don't use such huge camera sizes
the size is nice
hopefully it's a driver problem and it will be resolved in future drivers as I said I will leave you an update down below if I do find one so yet you can grab this tablet at
cool thank you so much for watching this video as I said please check the description if you are interested in the tablet some more and there's going to be specifications down on their actual website as well
I know if you like this kind of video and also if you want to subscribe because I put out new videos every single Sunday I will actually talk to you guys tomorrow
what's so great about
it's just a smartest
it was very professional and I thought I was gonna get scammed cuz I didn't take it seriously at first but everything went through and they were glorious companies you know me and gala nervous runs so going to the PD 2200 and other tablets
there's the USB cable the HDMI and the power port so make sure your computer has the USB and HDMI ports my USB cable wasn't going in all the way in the tablet in turn-ons I thought it was broken and I was like this close to emailing cam
and then me and my friend just like turned on the power switch for the outlet and everything was good two monkeys trying to fix a light bulb but the light bulb is inserted inside a watermelon
it's 21.5 inches and that leaves a lot of room for your arm to move around and I would recommend leaving it on your desk as opposed to moving it with you from room to room
the foam protects their eyes and prevent some of the harmful light from entering if you work long hours introducing the pen it's sleek and lightweight and didn't take me a long time to adjust you but see the cool is that it's battery free which they promote as being environmentally friendly and low maintenance
I couldn't finish my drawing that day and I couldn't make the trip to the store for another you know two days and when I went they were sold on that battery so the fact that you don't even have to worry about this pen dying randomly
this whole thing is just me trying to like make things more complicated than needs to be and wasting my life trying to figure things out when they're just really straightforward so the range of thin to thick lines is what I expected
my line stucked
open my cursor but
I really have to put it in my computer under pressure - sniffing holds up as I'm gonna keep 10 programs running and 20 times open at all times I think lag will be non-existent also like other screen tablets
this one can work as a dual monitor where you can drive your tabs in between the tablet and your main screen you're able to work on programs like Word Excel PowerPoint and other business based programs
I use paint or side only but later on I also try to create up Photoshop and a few of the apps on my school provided Creative Cloud account and they work
I was like different from laptops to phones computers to drawing tablets and even if they seem brand and type so just compare your screen to your monitor and adjust or color change on the PD 2200
I'm grateful for that
I once said the pictures here in case anyone needs help figuring out first you have to long press their M key for 6 seconds to pull up the menu screen and this thing will disappear after 15 seconds if you remain inactive and don't touch the buttons you can adjust the timing to be longer than 15 seconds if that's too short after you click the RGB icon and a pose of saturation on you for RGB cym which are the two color models for monitors and printed colors you know stuff you learn in Photoshop
2200 has the ability to show sixteen point seven million different colors which can give you the most accurate colors to your display and really promote freedom in the color spectrum that you're exploring also for your reference when using the hotkeys
I'm using that as an okay and I'm using the lights to go up and down and I'm using a key to go backwards if you're having any trouble or have any issues with the tablet on the gambling website
I'm just kidding but seriously it all comes down to what you want to do as an artist and if you can afford it my thought process is if you're younger or starting artists and just practice and drawing on paper because it to technical skill that will carry over into your art working on a tablet definitely boosts their efficiency and make some ones go faster
my friends tell me
I like the screen paper texture since it burns natural and I like the personal compared to its competitors and it gets pretty fair and they were really nice when contacting me so of course
I'm like
I like you just keep in mind the price what you want to do with our your skill level without the tablet and your drive to work hard and if you think that you're ready then the investment is worth it so to end thank you to my friends at
so here is it's very compact bucks and I'm going to unbox it like this for the first time you can see in the unboxing and here it is Google the Google tablet
this is very affordable
US is 275 dollars
you have a web browser so let me just show you how it looks compared to the Bacchus 9 this is a PC tablet the the best and maybe the only Windows and Intel tablet
you can fit more than two and two and a half nearly kind of of these and one of these Kenneth and here you have the accursed touch kind of device the arcus 32:28 which is $99 28 is really cheap but this is 275 US dollars or 249 euros and so let me show you up close high
Tab is that with this one you should use kind of like 50 euro MiFi and if you use a my 5 then you cannot have the same as a Galaxy Tab so I'm going to show you this device up close right now so check it out
Google Marketplace
we didn't click search
what is that
Android 2.1
that's a bad scene
shouldn't sign anything without reading first and then is anything else here in my well you want to see some Gmail stuff oh no that's just this is not the this is not the mobile version of Gmail I need to load the mobile version of Gmail
Gmail maybe this one no well I don't want to load the desktop version of Gmail because it's full of Roxy stuff so Wikipedia English and stuff about the tunnel in the streets on and not like this sellers mess up
yeah like that
should we try that
let's go in
I recommend not using a live wallpaper because I think it's kind of like use a lot of like this one usually of resources to animate like the background all the time
some games here
there's an HDMI output
just turn that microUSB it also works as a host and then there's a cool cake stand behind as you can put it on the table that is going out but the focus like this
it's very simple click
how does it work
then go back to
let's compare it with the device because some people might want to use this as a key reader so this is a this is a Sony e-reader and you could load some what is ready unit
slow over here
well it's non battery so it's slightly bigger and there you get a color eva'dur but I still kind of recommend you should use e ink if you want to read some stuff like sheerest reread because the backlight is not
and you can
there did it disconnect
you know
it's just standard
Android everything standard
it's really light huh
I stand behind
I'll make more and I'll show I'll test especially I'll test the video soon but they're still tweaking the firmers and stuff is kind of pretty release though but it's pretty stable let's say
HP tablet you see here this is the HP of the x2 10:13 g3 tablet that's a long name and HP should definitely work under naming conventions ok first before I get into my review
so when you buy the tablet you do get the tablet itself you get the keyboard with the trackpad you see here you do get the 65 watt fast charger
and you can go as low as a 120 gigabyte sata3 drive or you can go all the way up to a 1 terabyte nvme drive for a ram memory you can start off with 4 gigabytes of ram up to a maximum 16 gigabytes of RAM for the audio you have your bang in all of San audio with dual speakers or front-facing with a discreet
you do get a little loop here to put your HP active pen in just like you see right here now looking at the back of the keyboard it does have the soft touch textured material which makes it so it doesn't slip out of your hand which really nice all right now
hello face recognition certification
so this tablet this come with HP long life force our battery rated at 50 watt hours n HP states that the battery should last you about ten and a half hours now
it also comes with
Corning Gorilla Glass 4
what the privacy screen gives you is allows you to press the function f2 and it's gonna make it so that your screen is only readable by you and that others standing in the sides of the tablet this is a very good feature to have in a business setting if you're just using this tablet at home
instead okay
it did seem a bit flimsy to me at first however it is pretty solid it does need to be made out of some kind of metal and it doesn't have much flex to it and you can raise it up this high or just put it away completely one thing
you do
Pro's screen size
millimeter connection here
you have the volume up and down buttons and right here you have what's called a Kensington nano security slot to secure your tablet looking at the right side of the tablet you do have two USB 30-pin one type C with Thunderbolt ports then you have one USB 3.0 one type C power port for power delivery and DisplayPort connectivity
you'll find me
and you're done
it's 2 megapixels on the back and a paltry 0.3 megapixel VGA on the front but these are really just afterthoughts running fire OS 5 and equipped with wireless networking Bluetooth
you've got the built-in Kindle app and marketplace for ebooks the Amazon App Store for apps and games Amazon Instant Video for movies and TV recent Amazon purchase audible provides audiobooks while online
Amazon fire 7
I know many of you have been looking for something like this lately, and I think it can be a very interesting option for all those artists who can’t afford an expensive computer to draw with the usual graphic tablets that we all know, so I hope this review will be useful to all of you!
of course, we’ll see that in detail later, the instructions and several other papers are in this gap, the pen, the stand for the pen, the cable and the Android adapters.
As you can see the tablet is around 35x24 cm aprox, and barely 1 cm width, here you can see it’s suuuper thin, plus the little space for the plug.
Here’s the stand.
someone drew me with every review, the one you’re seeing as my desktop wallpaper was made by an artist called Hele-Bun, I’ll leave you a link to her galleries on the description box.
Press Keys.
As you can see
I put into it until I clicked on the Require Admin button, so I’d recommend, before changing anything make sure to click there and once you open the drivers again
we must go to the phone settings and enable the OTG mode (which in my case was under the name of USB debugging), the best you can do is type the model of your Android device on Google
But on Ibis
If you have any doubts just check the product’s website or get in touch with Huion to ask them if your Android device will work with the app you’d like to use. To sum it up; as you can see it works on phones and tablets! Honestly I’m still amazed, I’ve never thought I’d see a graphic tablet that could work on phones.
This time I’ll be doing a drawing of a very cute character from HannonSanDark, another artist, which of course you’ll have all the links to her galleries on the desription box if you’d like to check her work.
I think it’s a very nice size wither for professional work or people who have just started doing digital art. It’s thin, weights very little and only has 1 cable to worry about so it’s very portable.
At first I thought it would be a problem for me but after drawing for a couple of minutes on it I totally forgot about the texture, it’s honestly a very subtle difference in my opinion.
They’re easy to press but not super dooper sensitive that you can’t even brush your finger over them without activating the shortcut, but they aren’t too hard either to the point they'll distract you from your workflow.
The pen, like I mentioned earlier, doesn’t need to recharge, it’s very light and easy to hold, plus it has tilt recognition, which is a plus for all of you who work with certain Photoshop brushes
I can’t believe the quality is so SO close to Wacom. The default level of sensitivity is already super nice, so much that I debated for a while if I should really adjust it to make it a bit softer or not because it was already very sensitive.
Maybe it’s not exactly as sensitive as Wacom but is really, really, REALLY CLOSE, which is a great plus for me because I’m so nitpicky with this stuff, I don’t like having to press hard to draw.
(270 usd) aprox.
Definitely recommend it to any type of artist, beginners, professionals… If you’re looking for a tablet with similar features with a small budget, the H610 Pro v2 from Huion is a great option to consider.
~ Don’t forget to
And that’s it!
what's up everyone
what's in this box
i hear that since that logo and after the um the presentation with the team you know found out that's how you pronounce it since versus um which i initially thought it was medium
zip that down now
that feels really good
these are very solid
i definitely have to get back to you on how these perform rather than just come out with an additional tablet on the market and actually contact an artist to find out some things that uh they would like to see in a family and one thing
this definitely minimizes that there is also a quick key remote which um gives you the ability to i forget how many uh features or how many shortcuts you can program into it but there are quite a quite a few and there you have it
hey guys today
I'm excited to share a tablet review with you all the folks over at XP pen asked if I would like to review this tablet in exchange for the tablet itself and I very happily said yes
so thank you
cable a wireless connector a drawing glove a flash drive with the driver on it and the warranty and Quick Start Guide material so first I want to talk about some of the features of this tablet
by five point
Express keys which you can program to be your most commonly used shortcuts it works with Windows or Mac laptops or computers and you can use the included USB connection or you can go wireless now
it was at the same time it's nicely made it's not with the cheap material for really great quality materials and it's light enough to still travel with if you wanted to
I also love
Photoshop I feel like it had really good pull and I'm not sure really how to explain that but when I was starting my piece I liked how just it was just smooth
I'm prone to losing things so having this nice quality large case helped me with that and also I love the idea of being able to put your pen in the case
smaller brush function and I use it all the time it really quickened my workflow because I didn't have to keep clicking a button to change the brush size like I normally would have had to
I think this dial is really a standout feature for me and if you get one of these definitely program it to be a function that you use all the time so now for a couple things I struggled with a bit
I struggled a bit with the fact that I'm a light handed artist so I have a really light touch and I kept the click sensitivity all the way towards light but I had to press pretty hard still to get my dark values
maybe eyedropper tool when I click it so in the past all I've had to do is hover over a color and click the button on my pen and it picks up the color in one step but with this current driver
I programmed one of my express keys to be the Alt key so when I wanted to pick up a color I would just press my Express key and then press down on the color I wanted to pick up with the pen tip and those two steps would get the job done
I really liked that
I also think it's a great choice for beginners who are looking to experiment with digital painting but aren't sure if they want to invest the big bucks just yet this will give you a good experience at a lower price point overall great quality tablet and
I'll add links in the description below if you're interested in purchasing this tablet and thank you so much for watching guys and please enjoy the rest of the painting
and then when you need to you can actually clear off the contents with a tap of a button so it was a very cool concept and a few years later we have a lot of more generic models from other manufacturers
the version here is interesting because it has a erasable functionality so again in the past these pores can be written on but they have to be erased a hundred percent
here there's actually a race mode that you can tap on and then you race partial elements on the board so it acts very much like a eraser on a actual pencil but that being said just like the other versions that we've checked out it does not have any smart features like built-in Bluetooth or Wi-Fi for you to save the actual doodles that you take and sync it with your smart phone
we have the stylus on the very top and there's also an included lanyard strap which you can hook on if you want to prevent yourself from losing it accidentally otherwise
if you want to use the erase function it actually does wear down as well just like a regular eraser through friction and as you start using it a little bit otherwise
OMA is a pale
greenish blue color
it's super-sensitive flows like ink on paper compared to the other generic versions that we checked out a few months back was actually requiring you to press down a lot harder to actually make a mark and the color is a lot more pale in comparison as you can see there so this is more authentic to the actual color of the first boogie-board that we reviewed many years ago
which is interesting
if you just carry it around the palm rejection isn't quite as good as on that one which is less sensitive so for example if I'm pressing down here and kind of writing you can see
it's also going to record your hand marks as you are jotting down notes versus again the previous-generation here if I put my palm down and kind of even press down on it
alright so if
and the board only draws power when the erase function is activated when it's displaying a static image as you're drawing it's not consuming any power even if it's just sitting there for days or even years so the technology here is kind of similar to e ink that you find on
eBook readers I Kindles and that it only takes power when the electrons are kind of put back into their original position and when you refresh the page so to speak now
we're making it lighter but it's actually doing a full erase for the small portions that you want so it's actually very impressive at how well it works and if you use the other for example it's not quite as effective you know we've timed out here but again back to you race if you use a hard tip it's not quite as effective
you can do that because if you are patient with it you are able to press a bit more lightly and get a slightly more lighter line versus a really hard line you can see it becomes a bit thicker as well so you can shade between different thicknesses just by applying different amounts of pressure
if you want to again save on paper now if we take a closer look at the design of the tablet we kind of skipped over that initially it's made of a coarse polycarbonate plastic and it is extremely slim as you can see there
I would recommend putting it into a laptop sleeve or something that has more of a soft surface if you are taking it with you otherwise on the bottom here with this screw is where the cell battery is located it takes one standard cr2032 battery which again will last for up to two years or roughly 10,000 you races before you need to swap it out
so it doesn't actually stick onto a fridge or anything but it does have a lock key on the back so you can lock it from doing things like you races if you wanted to preserve whatever is on here so for example if I put it into the lock mode now none of the keys in the front will work
nothing happens partial
it's a version
because of the development cost but all these years later the technology has become again much more accessible because of third-party vendors and other manufacturers also trying their hand at the screen technology
I think is a decent size and it still is very much legible especially if you have light pointing down at it again very similar to iing technology in the sense I it's not a backlit display
so if all the lights are completely done then it will become harder to read but otherwise no viewing angle issues even though it's an inverted color and you can also use the flash on your smartphone if you just want to capture a quick snapshot and then save it before you racing it again so you can check out more details if you're looking for a LCD writing tablet and the links on below this one again with that erasable functionality here at OS reviews
hey guys so
I wanted to do a quill review here of the Lynx 1010 tablet which I've been playing with over the last couple of days I wanted to let you know my thoughts in regards this device
it does the main things quite well you know like you were browsing etc and the performance is quite good but you might want to be aware of some of the issues
you can see
we're getting like USB ports for your keyboard mouse as well as well as other charging kind of devices you're also getting your HDMI out for connecting to HDMI TV as well as charging port on you on the sides you'll also find expandability for micro SD card slot so that it takes up to 64 gigs internal storage
I think or so no in fact there isn't there isn't a card reader on there so do bear that in mind but you know the build quality here is very solid at the end of the day
try to turn the brightness down a little bit so you can see the content a bit more so basically you should be able to see the content here can see there's no like jaggedness of the text etc
the content is very legible which is good and pinch-to-zoom works very well in terms of you know zooming in on stuff so for your web browsing it's very usable but I think the main issue really is in regards to the viewing angles of the display
when like you're in a brightly lit environment so do bear that in mind but I'm happy to say the actual performance of the tablet is very nice and slick here in terms of the you know the kind of like day-to-day usage
I think we're going so if we load up GameSpot so you can see loads of page relatively quickly here and that also extends to using the inbuilt kind of apps here so like for example the the in Bill Windows 10 apps which do though usually quite quick taking a bit of time here though I'm on camera but we'll it low
it seems that like when you are like in a different room next different room from your router it struggles to maintain a good connection to the Wi-Fi I have noticed it disconnect quite a few times actually which is not very good for a 2015 kind of device so probably the
that's the main kind of issue here if I look at the resource monitor somewhere here task manager and then can I look at the performance can see the actual revenue stage is about 1 gig here
so you getting about one gig free to use and the CPU usage isn't that high rarely a little bit of a spike there but I don't think the the actual performance of the tablet is the problem
and things like that
I've taken this shot recently and you know it's detailed enough but again I wouldn't probably use it as my main kind of camera here it's just I think added on as like a novelty here really
there's also a front-facing camera here but I don't take many selfies so I'm not sure of the quality of it but you know it it does the job at the end of the day but I think really if you're going to get one of these then using it for like you know media your office and things like that
I did actually manage the place from counter-strike on it as well in dead space and it seemed to handle that on the low settings it's just a Wi-Fi issue if you need it for you know heavily kind of internet stuff then I probably advise you to look elsewhere you know pay a little bit more for maybe a HP tablet or Asus Transformer something with like a brand name or even a surface but then you know you spending a bit more than but you know that's what I think really in regards to
the battery life is good as well easily getting you through like about eight nine hours quite good usage so but it's just the Wi-Fi issue that's the thing that I would probably be hesitant to recommend
so yeah hope you found this helpful if you're looking at this tablet and I'll probably do some gaming videos on it if I get time but yes just a quick video here and I'll see you in the next one Cheers

oh three graphics tablet
I mention it
welcome into straw tablet and just like my old welcome it comes with 2048 levels of pen pressure sensitivity and it can be used for both right and left-handed people
that you can customize however you want generally the installation was rather simple the only thing you have to remember is to completely uninstall all previous tablet drivers one thing
Sai is to make sure that the drivers running as admin but that wasn't too much of a hassle and I can make a separate video in which I explain the fixes to some of the small issues I ran into the whole ignore reacting in size
probably the biggest issue
I personally don't feel like those are major issues for tablet costing less than 60 euros aside from these three minor three or four minor downsides they've mentioned I think it's big an affordable tablet and works without a hitch and I would totally recommend this to anyone on a budget
it just works
because it's still in my home country and I haven't been able to get my parents to send it to me after I've moved but yes here's a picture of what it looks like
8.1 machine and it also works on my Windows 10 laptop and I've seen from reviews and other people's notes that works fine with a Mac so yeah I totally think that if you're looking for cheap tablet to go with this brand and yeah down in the comments are feeling some more you can buy it and yeah the rest of the videos just need doing quick speed paint off like with this tablet so you can see it in action and yeah thank you for watching this video and I will see you in the next video bye
Tab pro series nonetheless
we finally have the
air this year now this new tablet from Samsung might take the cake now I personally pay 499 dollars retail for this and it comes with 32 gigabytes of internal storage and the other premium tablet the other Apple iPad air 2 as of this video is offering bears for the same price but it only comes with 16 gigabytes
that goes all the way around giving a very nice solid feel and grabbed the sharp edges makes holding this in the palm secure enough despite the tablet being so thin
I personally love this
my biggest gripe
it's not a simple flap that you can rotate to access like last year's model but now you require a pin to stick in to pop open the tray for something buying an SD card and leaving it in there works great but for those like myself where I transfer movies back and forth from PC to tablet it does pose an obstacle moving downward the micro USB 2.0
the speakers are loud enough with the s2 and decent for a tablet speaker however they're slightly not retaining its clarity at maximum volume when compared to the Apple iPad air 2 in addition it does sound less warm and bacey and the air 2 does project voices louder when I can paired them side-by-side but back to the physical features
you have the same 8 megapixel camera and this time with no LED light or an LED flash like last year's model however one improvement is the ability to film in 4k resolution and very much less going to the front samsung upgraded their fingerprint scanner with a OneTouch feature versus the model from last year
where you had a swipe your thumb for my experience this works better and it's worked every time getting into the meat and potatoes the screen last year's model which has a ten point five inch came with a resolution of 2560 by 1600 that gorgeous display this year's model a nine point seven inch screen with a resolution of 2048 by 1536 identical to that of the Apple iPad air
2 but shockingly
Samsung has taken a slight step back in pixel density compared to last year's model at 264 PPI s for those who are more peculiar in stares at the screen looking for imperfections
I mean it is working for Apple of course but the biggest change is the departure from a widescreen movie friendly sixteen by ten aspect ratio to a more square more traditional four by three
so it's really a matter of preference and I know some old favor one over the other the tab S line so far as of this video is the only tablet in the Samsung lineup that offers AMOLED technology the same technology as in these smartphones these Samsung s6 note 5 and of course last year's tablet the tap s now this screen has crazy colors
it pops like crazy either by itself or when held to another tablet the saturation might be a little too intense when you have brightness all the way up but of course you can always down down the brightness but surprisingly with the white comparison it seems that the Tab s 2 does well with offering a pure white on previous models sometimes it appears to have a yellow or reddish tint or so and not sure if it's showing well in the video in the camera here but in person it makes the iPad air to look slightly gray actually and just real quick and try not to get too technical before I discussed using the tablet
found in these
Samsung claims up to 12 hours of video and up to 8 hours of Internet use so with my experience with a mix of steady video and then text graphics for games it appears to be around the lower numbers that Samsung is claiming now I do admit it does get slightly warm when playing games on the back here most likely due to being very thin but not too hot to the point where it is uncomfortable another feature that
now regarding recharging the Tab s 2 had taken me exactly 4 hours and 31 minutes from a dead battery while the tablet was on and the screen was off
I'll be honest
maybe they knew that
Apple was not intending on announcing a new iPad air 3 in September who knows but Samsung has clearly made this more portrait mode friendly with a 43 aspect ratio to moving the speakers from either side in landscape mode to the bottom where the s2 stands vertically possibly catering more towards those who desire ear eaters nonetheless
the screen quality is still one the best to look at and I would say if you have last year's Tab s I would say just keep it no need to upgrade if you don't have a tab S just yet and looking for the best of the best
this might still be the one for you but this time it really feels like you're paying a premium price and I mean really premium when there's so many other tablets out there today and maybe some down the road with better specs at a cheaper price so hope this review helped you in some way if you like my work be sure to
it has a little thank-you card on the top from the who young company for purchasing your credit and then next it has a download driver manual website link in many different languages a warranty card and then this is the tablet inside this protective casing to keep it full a fresh brand new goodness
so that's awesome and then that's a USB cable that plugs into your computer and that's adapter for your phone if you prefer to use it on your phone those are pen nips extra pen nibs and these are some more extra payments
I didn't grab that one because for one it costs more than the other one and for - the one I got had like 10 extra pen nibs and a screen protection glove the special edition one did not come with those so that was my deal-breaker and so I went with the planar looking one
one of the pros is that when comparing this tablet to the Wacom Bamboo pen tablet which is what I first started out using when I was drying digitally is that this one is just as good as the
Wacom Bamboo
so if you wanted to use it on your portable phone device you could and I don't have any of those to show you but it's still handy to have nonetheless the pen pressure sensitivity made the coloring process for this image
the ones on my tablet kind of felt out of reach being up at the top area of the tablet so I kind of sort of gave up on them
the other problem
I had with it is that I had a difficult time finding a comfortable spot to use it on my table and because of this I had to take many breaks while using it
I had it up on my tabletop for about half the art process while using it and then later I found that having it on my lap near my knees was the most comfortable spot and I think it's because my arm felt more relaxed in a downward position when installing this type of pen tablet be sure to uninstall any other tablet devices on your computer otherwise the pen pressure sensitivity will not work
it's a tutorial fan art mostly featuring the cat bus because I had a pull up on my patreon and I had my supporters vote on what I should draw for this tablet review and so the tutorial cat bus won
part and that's because
I just want to say that I colored this whole image using the Huyen HS 64 pen tablet and because the drawing looks like it belongs on a shirt I did just that and I made it available to purchase on my red bull bull store as well
so yeah
that's pretty much all
it's very affordable for its quality and it works great and would be a lovely drying tablet to start out with if you're a newbie to tablets it's what I would have gotten
alright that's it
I'll put more information in the description so it came with a USB cable and also TG cable as well and this is the tablet here and we have a manual and this is a decent case in which the tablet came in so guys this is it and is the brand
start up with this tablet and I'll be putting the model of this in the video title and if you look it actually came with extra protection this styrofoam inside of it and Roy is starting
we have photos
we can go here
we can close when we close if we want to go to the main Android system we just we can set our own password or we can just add 15 plus 14 which is 29
Android setting here and these are all the apps that are if you want one of these tablet to use for your children or child I should see it's very ideal and you do have a special desktop setting that you can use for your children and you and use this tablet as well differently
and you want them to explore playing games and also if you will also like to use these tablets as well so guys for this review this is it the name of this tablet is X gaudy tablet PC as you can see here on the box and for the official model number
my name is lens
it just arrived
and it's basically the screen size is the same as this one which was released a bunch of years ago and then after that they came with the the 5v
so this is 5 inch and it's really nice and it's correction to have 5 inch but it kind it kind of gets big in the pocket especially if you want to have if you want to have the like the leather case around and stuff it kind of is big and that's why this is a really cool new new generation so let's check it again the difference in size it is more compact
but it's not really
it's not heavier
I think it's lighter actually and it's thinner more compact but it's not more compact but it's thinner and then it's not really much bigger at all you get a 4.3 inch screen it's the same experience as the Droid X so let's get closer that let's browse on some websites
right here it's not one of those modern ones because it supports Wi-Fi n and the ruler right here is gene type but the web browsing speed should be pretty fast and it's gone another website over here we can go on
I can use a fast room and see if it might be possible or not to strain 720p videos so this is the amount of text you see if you can see you right here
width of the screen
high resolution and stuff
yeah there's there's a HD camera inside which is cool you have that built in that included and right now I'm gonna go on the network there's a Samba Network share
farbros there
I'm gonna test in one minute and there's a USB host right here and also a USB to connect to the computer and to charge as well you have to charge the you the the computer but the battery is not very big and not very heavy
how long it takes
I plugged it before
it supports 3d games
there's a nice big
I will overtake everybody
it's an apk file
I have access to Skype so let's connect to an HDTV and see how it looks on an HDTV alright so right now we have connected with HDMI output and this is an amazing HD web browsing experience
I can load
you know it's it's possible to use the Aquajet as a touchpad but the best is of course you just leave that cause there and you use a Bluetooth keyboard and a bluetooth mouse on one of those combination Bluetooth keyboard and mouse and sit in far far away and that would be the way to do it and basically it's the built-in Google TV
there's a full
it's just awesome
working let me go back to the main menu and I'm going to go in and let's place play games just for a second so you can see how the game is right here
this is 720p video with DTS audio which is very very high quality audio one point five megabits per second just for the audio and a nearly three megabit for the 720p video
I just did a video recording in four megabit per second and using this device so I'm going my recordings and the last video which is how does it work
usually it my camcorder
you can go down to like some crazy low bit rates but this is a test for now it's a four-minute e per second 720p with its little little camcorder
it's just put in here so you are seeing those two videos at the same time and it can go up to 8 megabit per second in the settings but it needs to be tested more
there's some drops frames or something that there might be some some trouble with the with the bit rates of all these things and let's just open the gallery for a second
I could go in the settings to try and see what the resolution is of this image or that's registering quakes again if I go in more maybe crop set as well
testing out the HD files in our report I'm the HD support and so far as it's just been HDMI output and whole bunch of things about the F cost 43 internet tablet
thanks for watching
let's go to
is the camera
yeah it looks not too bad but as soon as you have low light it will become much harder to take a photo and it's icing is limited to 5 megapixels
the speaker is good
let's try some games
this one is good
CSR racing - okay
I've used okay
I'll connect the keyboard
I sing ever
No sometimes big to just up you can see popped in but if I press any two holes all the way wait for the I don't use it rightly need to push it up
it's pretty good
web browsing is good
8100 tablet a tea
not a tea
it's got the
you can't even get to that part so you can actually replace the battery keeper spare as well you know pretty handy at the same time you can also get different back covers as well so if you want to get a blue one you can get a blue back cover which you know allows you to personalize your tablet a little bit which again is different so other manufacturers you'll also note there's a lot more to it around the edges so we've got a lock mechanism here the power button volume rocker and another lock mechanism
SD card slot for our cameras and so forth which is which is really really cool under here if I remove this little guy we have a mini USB slot full HDMI and USB so you can plug your USB key into it look at the files on there copy back and back on and off which is great a little worried about this thing
I don't think you really need that much of a bezel and I guess I don't know if it's a design issue or whatever it is but I think it's a bit too thick around the edges
just an observation
the graphics are pretty impressive on this unit as well when you are looking at from the side you notice the camera here now generally if you're holding the laptop the tablet you almost cover the camera and I think that you know the camera is better positioned over here
because it's at least
I think that's a problem but turning it on if you haven't seen Android before they are kind of much of a muchness you know you can have different screens with widgets and resizable windows a picture frame clocks and favorite icons here now all
it all comes through my youtube channel even my Picasa album so when I go into gallery you can see these are all Picasa albums so I don't have to really have anything stored on the device if I don't want to because it's all synchronized with them with Picasa
sorry about the lighting
I've already created one spreadsheet just to sort of play around and it's really quite simple you have a quite a lot of functionality which I am I kind of liked you know push button for the keyboard entering numbers and data is quite quite easy and you can obviously save them things like that
it's just it works so easily really really easy to do divided their own media player as well which i think is actually pretty good so you can have everything sort of in one so when I go into my images you know I can go here and have a look at all photos now
I kind of like it other things that they've added it comes with this not in security which is really handy because you know there was a lot of malware on my android unfortunately other editions which
wiki and printer share
so you can
obviously sorry in saying that you're still get access to the full marketplace which is just packed with you know which you can always look at plenty to choose from
you know there's now
I'm not gonna have the issue with with the camera but I just think maybe this is what they wanted and if this is what they wanted fine but you know I guess it's just the way they're doing it okay so ultimately you've seen it you're a really really quick run-through
I don't put too much time into this because it is just and you know people will say it's just another Android tablet what it is but I wanted to show you that key different apps which are on there which separate them from the others and also what they do on the outside in the highway
because that's where most
I think I saw the Toshiba tech rearranged or Tegra range so if I'm pronouncing it wrong it's Tegra laptops over $1000 is only in Australia as far as I know
I've seen that's all however if you're interested take a look if you have any questions shoot me an email this mo is gone in about a week in a bit sorry guys
sorry if you'd like to place donation please do and ask me two questions on Twitter and Facebook and hopefully I will see you next time without this little guy and we've got some more things coming up to review so stay in touch that's the Toshiba 8100 not 8180 alpha tomato 100
thanks for watching guys
to have because
There's our driver.
however you want.
No matter what.
That is sweat.
All things considered this tablet has multiple pros, such as its high refresh rate and very low input lag that makes your gameplay very fluid, there's also its intuitive design, as it doesn't require much settings tweaking before working like a charm, plus its stability on the desk of course, which is a must.
in my opinion, well not the price itself, because for 40 dollars/32 euros on their official website, it's not that bad, but you can count at least 10 dollars of fees depending on your country so that makes it a bit unfair.
this is the Lenovo Tab m8f HD and there are a lot of flaws in this tablet but why do I like this tablet so much and I'm gonna tell you exactly why so starting with build quality
that way
it didn't give me that kind of problems just because I really don't like when you're trying to hear when you try to read comics for example let's say I'm reading one one punch man and I'm trying to like swipe and then it's kind of sticky in it
okay um
which feels a little bit less safe to me because I'm kind of afraid of dropping the tablets so that's another thing as well it's not really a pro or con
I'll have to say I'm a little bit unsatisfied with it just because of how easily my hands when I'm holding it as compared to holding a metal okay moving on to the screen of the device again IPS LCD
it's not ambled
it's not quite surface pro level just because surface pro level is gonna be 2560 by 1440 which has a pretty high pixel density but I'm perfectly satisfied with this for example
I'm reading comics
everything looks pretty good
then we should be good because there's a lot of color in there so for example if I went to Asterix the goal and we took a look at the color
yeah no complaints
I will say that's the cup although I have no complaints about the color the one area I do have complaints about is gonna be the maximum brightness so max brightness that's your max brightness and
it's not horrible
it's not amazing
so it's still good but it's just not as good so that again might have something to do with the stickiness of the display when my hands are sway so if I'm like swiping her stuff like that and then my hand you know skips because of sweat
I'm watching like it's it's okay for you know I'm watching Brooklyn nine-nine or something like that audio is fine but if I'm watching something else like something with a lot of bass then you're not gonna want to watch this without headphones because bass is really not there
yeah so on this
I liked so much well unfortunately the next part about this I'm gonna talk about is the software which again not outstanding speed is a little bit slow so I'll just show you what version of Android we have and let's go here and here we have Android 9 so I don't know how to get to the to the nest or that like a egg thing or something like that anyway
so the single core performance on the mediatek you know p22 is really not that great which is one of the reasons why this thing is so slow when you're swiping it actually gets better when you're launching apps for example you're launching
I launched YouTube
let's let's launch
I I was
I think it was
I think it was a seven hours of manga three hours of candy crush and I was at like 22 percent so again completely how the left-field did not expect the battery life to be that great and again
I'm not completely bashing the tablet at this point because if the battery life on this was bad I would have just told you guys not to buy it but the battery life here is amazing so so good so much that I that
let's go again
I've tested enough of these devices that I basically know how well a thing should perform because I think I've tested probably 150 phones tablets laptops at this point so like I said before in the unboxing this thing works pretty well for games 1920 by 1200 resolution again ashphalt is a very
I died
it's a very well optimized game so you don't need super powerful hardware to play it which is the same for a lot of crap which is the same for a lot of games actually just because the developers have to cater to such a wide audience of devices and that makes it difficult for them to sorry
G Arness right now
whatever same price
very very addicting
okay alright guys
I did miss something
I think it took like two and a half to three hours to completely charge this thing up which is pretty bad but then again this thing is not that expensive of a tablet
be just because if you're sitting there reading you'd only be charging every 5-6 hours this thing you can read the whole day and you would probably be okay remember
so if you're okay if you're using if you want to buy a tablet for reading manga and comics yes you get this because you don't need a fast tablet
I don't know I would say no just because this thing isn't the most powerful gamer gaming tablet and at the same time you probably want to get like a tablet with a with a more powerful processor
these are the so-called soft key so you have to pre program them yourself and to activate them you have to use your stylus to press on the number itself
I personally do not use this because whenever I need to use them I have to look at the numbers in order to click it so I don't like looking at the surface when I can look at my screen while drawing so I use the physical buttons mode because I can feel the physical buttons
so if you are using other programs if the keyboard shortcuts for other programs are similar to photoshop then you can share the buttons but if they are not similar to photoshop then these buttons may or may not work with regards key with other software so in order to use this tablet
it's those pots that
because i don't like to have too many cables so i just use one cable so once you plug it in and if you move your pen around you can see the light will shine so once you click it on a surface
v 11.0 point 8
sometimes they have this little square box where you can see your pressure curve but not for this particular driver and for some reason you cannot drag this little button around you can click it around but you just cannot track it so strange thing screen setting
let's see what their things are under advanced setting now for advanced setting you can change their physical buttons on the left side of the tablet so these are all in buttons that are available and if you want soft keys at the top of the drawing area you can do so as well
here oops accidentally check that so you can turn the tablet around to use it if you are a left-handed person and I think that is all for the driver settings nothing too much
it's pretty straightforward
as for the pen
you just use the supplied cable plug it in and then plug the USB port into your computer there pen has two buttons here and the grip is sort of like some sort of matte surface overall
I like pen
I think it comes out a bit too easily but anyway if you are not going to be pulling it out is not going to be a problem so this is the tip here
this is the stand
is this little piece of metal that you can use to basically clip the nib here and pull it out just now as I have shown you you can just pull it out with your fingers and let's put this together so it goes together like this and you can put a pen on top of it like this battery
it can last for several weeks so that the fact that this is battery power is not going to be a problem at all and because there is a charging pot behind you don't have an eraser behind a pen
this is photoshop
that is good friction
there is good control
so let's
sometimes they have problems
alright okay
Pro I'm not sure if this is a problem with the MIDI Bank paint Pro or with the Wii on tablet drivers but I don't have this sort of problems with Wacom tablets so let me close this and switch to another application
let's try
Krita this is let me choose the brush pressure sensitivity works oops their cursor is stuck so once I start was a liftoff the cursor from the ones that leave the pen off the surface of the tablet the cursor on the screen stops in Hanks until I put down another stroke but when it hangs I can't see where the cursor is going to go even though I'm moving my pen across the tablet so I'll say that this is also unusable in Krita
I've drawn something
so these are the thin lines and if you draw them thick for pressure just other thick lines and clear the converse thin and thick and thin and thick all right so this is quite a good tablet for drawing in mischief as well
let's try this
it doesn't really support a lot of tools with pressure sensitivity so the only one that suppose it is this particular pen and it works quite well too so if I press down hard I can get darker lines for this particular pen and the lines are straight
they are predictable
they go where
yeah this is one
this is sketches
Pro and it works
some of them work
and lastly the pricing
and if you are using these drawing tablet to share with me some of your experience especially when it comes to software support thanks for watching see you in the next video and remember to subscribe to my youtube channel if you haven't done so for more
Wacom is really popular among both the digital artists and O's players but I don't think you're here to watch me do art so I'm going to briefly skim over that aspect
Haku which will be in the description a reason I got this driver instead was because it's more optimized for O's and most of the players I know have been using this driver nonetheless
os-- it's great
yeah little wispy suppose
I am reviewing one
what am the heat
one one
six one tablet to review for you guys it was shipped to me very safely and included some padding so it didn't break in the post or anything when I opened it
I have already but but it's a nice change it's what loads are but as long as I which is cool and it's also much much thinner than I expected it to be then there's the pen holder
if it's a man nicely these are the USB was and there's also USB connectors so you can use your tablet on your phone if you wanted to so you don't even have to have a computer for this tablet finally
there's a paperwork first
says is she telling you where to get the drivers and then the warranty and then finally the instruction manual includes a lot of different languages of an English which is very helpful if you don't speak English and that's everything in the box that's also video me shoving nugget into the box because why the break knob time to use it since it was a bit bigger than my other tablet struggled a little for space but I can work that
I started to draw immediately though I have to admit I struggled a little because it's a lot different than my other tablet but I think I'm getting that I'm just gonna take some time
put out
it's not one of the newer models but it is a display screen that I draw directly on it's been probably about five years since I've really played with using an actual tablet one of the things
is that it has tilt sensitivity and what that means is when you put your pen on the tablet it is supposed to be able to tell whether or not you're tilting within a certain degree and in which direction it's tilting and you know if you're a digital artist and you like using fancy brushes that means quite a lot a feature like that is really really great when it comes to doing digital art because it opens up a whole new world of what you can do with your tools
I'm gonna take this
I'm gonna get it installed I'm gonna get it set up and ready to go and we'll go over some of what's in the box and then we'll talk about what it's like using it
and that's that gives you just enough room to be able to work comfortably without feeling too confined it's got over eight thousand levels of pressure sensitivity which is pretty standard for most tablets and display screens
Express keys that can be customized within the hue on software you can customize these Express keys to do certain functions within your program for instance with me control Z is popular undo undo undo
I've always had a hard time going to other brands but after using this like I gotta say I'm a fan I like the pressure sensitivity I like the tilt sensitivity
connect this to it
and now you've got a mobile art studio without having to spend you know hundreds of dollars or thousands of dollars even my only real gripe with this is the base and that's only because it's super
it doesn't have any kind of like even a little piece of rubber or something on the bottom that would keep it from sliding off of my desk because I've bumped it off of my desk a few times
the cool thing is it does come with some extra nibs inside so when you wear them out you can replace them pretty easily and it has its own little nib remover where you take the nib of the pen push it into the bottom of the stand tilt it a little bit and then pull and it pulls the nib right out and
I'm really happy that they sent me this to review because it's the first Huyen product that i've actually tried and like i said i'm really impressed and I'm very curious now to try out more of their products
I want to thank you for taking the time to watch this video if you have any questions or comments be sure to leave those down below and I will get to with any information that I might have left out accidentally and as always until next time keep creating and take care
hey guys how's it going as haha there today we're going to be reviewing star g6 40s by XP Pen and as you can tell from the name it is an upgraded version for the star G 640 by XP pen
I believe one of the best tablets out there for also gameplay and I thought that it would be a good idea to do a review of this model also now the back of this tablet is a bit of a cluster
so we're gonna go to the website and see what the company has to say about this tablet espy pen claims that this tablet is portable and sleek sitting at nine millimeters of thickness
do both hands covered
which means that
it's going to have 10 extra nibs for you and here are the additional specifications it's gonna be sitting in at 6 by a 3.75 inches 266 reports per second and 5 to 10 millimeters of reading height with all the specs aside without further ado
remove the box cover
that's covering everything and inside you'll find a little bit of a goodie bag here and yeah that's pretty much it so basically all we have is tablet body and the goodie bag that contains all the accessories first of all
I believe is a sticker so that you can have your tablet you know pen be stored here just like the Wacom CTL 480 style and a lot of different paper
a warranty card
it is much thicker on the pen tip side and much thinner on the other end and since this is a passive pen it does not require any battery or recharging and to do a bit of a comparison
I'm gonna go and bring the G 640 pen that I have and as I've mentioned before it's much thicker on the pen tip side and much thinner on the other end and the overall length is a little bit longer - well added
I hate this pen
now we're going to be talking about the tablet body is encased in a plastic wrap so we're gonna go ahead and remove that and as we take this tablet out the first thing that I noticed from the back of this tablet body where the four rubber feet into each corners of the tablet
I don't really know what I'm gonna do with these but I'll probably find a way out the tablet body as mentioned is going to be 9 millimeters in thickness which is pretty thin
if you're using the left-hander mode it's gonna be on your right hand side so the connector as you can see is going to be connected like so and some people
it didn't because of the 90 degree angle cable you can as mentioned before use it as a left handed mode also and of course it's not a haha peer review without a direct tablet
40s tablet but it doesn't seem to be the case in terms of the marking here and the length is supposed to be the same for 4 inches but that also doesn't seem to be the case where the
it feels really nice and to go to the tablet driver you go to the website that I linked below and go to the driver section and instead of doing the G for 30 g 640 tablet driver
actually fourth row
and after it finishes downloading you can go ahead and connect your tablet to it and it's going to pop up like this it's all in Korean but it's very straightforward
just you just only need to focus on the right side where everything's happening and as I'm pressing the pen right now you'll see that the pressure sensitivity is going up and down and what's important that you can change the tablet area on the right hand side
I think they actually fixed the force proportion so that the forespore portion button actually forces the aspect ratio to be 16 by 9 in the case of my monitor
it's going to allow you to input the top left corner of your tablet in the bottom right corner of your tablet to set the rectangle for your area and I'm gonna show you like so
and that's going to directly translate to the tablet area and this is something that I've been asking xB pen to do strictly on my G 640 tablet review and I they actually sent me an email for feedback and I told them specifically that this approached from the Wacom site is good and they actually followed it and I'm really really happy
that company is going the right direction of making sure that their tablet is getting better and subsequently their drivers are also getting better while the light play is happening on the background
it's just a really good tablet to have in general if G 4:30 and g6 for you were kind of like daily driver for also only purpose and you kind of just store it away
for me personally
quality is actually a decent choice compared to spending 30 extra dollars for something like CTO for 72 or spending a lot more than that to get a discontinued CTO for 80 on eBay
10 something dollars is a decent investment considering that this has better build quality and arguably better pen also speaking of the pen on the rubber grip actually helped me a decent bit making sure that the pen doesn't look out of my hand
actually it happens quite a lot for other pen tablets such as g6 40 84 30 or even the CTO or 80 pen like even that pen sometimes falls out of my hand because my hand gets so sweaty
although you could argue that this pen was a bit more bulky on the pen tip side so there definitely was a bit of a learning curve for me to get used to because
I was so used to just using slim pen and now having to get used to the thicker part of the pen was a bit of a challenge but I got used to it pretty quickly
maybe the extra price can be a bit of a problem for you but I personally believe spending a little more or the better product is always a good decision in the long run
of course you know
your tablet you know driver preference will be different so if you want to really get the best tablet you'll have to try out pretty much everything out on the market but this will definitely be
I would say my go-to recommendation for people who have tried out G 430 and thinks that it's a little bit too small or have tried out G 640 and thinks that is stupid too flimsy or is looking for AC tail 480 but cannot find one on the market
if you have any questions most of them is going to be answered in the video description but if you have any questions other than that feel free to leave them down below at the comment section
it's 6:30 a.m.
I've been editing this video for quite a long time and I have school in like two hours so I'm gonna need to sleep like at least one hour bye bye
It's 13.3 inches diagonally.
Now if I do some quick line tests, the line quality is great, it's very smooth, there's no significant line jitter even if I'm doing diagonal lines, there's virtually no parallax or offset to the cursor.
Now let's discuss compatibility.
Now the USB-C USB-A HTMI and power are all combined into an X cable, the power end of the connector is a USB-A connection which plugs into this AC power adapter and this adapter can be converted for different outlet types and then the USB-C cable connects to the tablet.
It must be connected to a Windows, Mac or a compatible Android device such as the Samsung, Galaxy S8, S10+, and some of the Samsung Galaxy Notes as well as some other types of phones.
This here is legit.
My Samsung devices are not on the list of compatible devices, so unfortunately I'm not able to try it myself, but from what I have seen, it looks really cool.
You can take notes, you can edit photos, you could edit videos, you could of course do some light drawing and painting on this device, you could do graphic design and more.
So for example
The Cintiq 16 offers a better pen, it has a better display that is a bit brighter, its drawing area is of course a bit larger, it has an option for an attachable and adjustable stand and the Cintiq 16 is compatible with the Art Pen which can sense rotation and other types of Wacom pens. However, the Wacom One is definitely thinner, lighter and more portable, especially if you're planning to work primarily on a compatible phone or tablet. The Cintiq 16 with the stand attached can be quite bulky.
The Wacom One is also a more-affordable alternative to the Intuos Pro, if you don't mind trading some of the pro-level features for a display that you can draw directly on to.
The Wacom One does not include the adapter to connect it to an Android device, but you may not need it, so I guess it does keep the cost down. The Wacom One only supports certain Android devices.
and it does not support touch, so that means you're going to have to lug around a keyboard if you are planning on using this with a phone or tablet only.
that's on your desk.
I feel like I'm beating a dead horse here, but I urge you to check out my comparison video of the XP-Pen Artist 15.6 Pro to a Wacom tablet, so you can get a feel for what the real differences are because tablets are more than just specs on a website.
I believe and then it's literally just one button on this device the Clear button you can see if I click that it'll actually just clear off the screen so you can have a whole page of writing if you press it
there's a little sort of battery compartment up here and you'll sort of slot a battery in there when you first open it out of the box but beyond that it is literally just these three different things the pin the screen and the Clear button and so now I'm gonna realize I've been using this for a few months now and I am actually really surprised by just how much I find myself using this riding tablet like when I first got it I so thought it was a bit gimmicky but really I cannot believe just how much I find myself picking this up just using it to sort of school summaries or even just you know draw a funny picture or something yeah
I find that I actually surprisingly use this a lot more than I thought so you know I still do obviously use you know paper and stuff to write on but you know if I just want to sort of scribble something down or just write like a quick list
it's just got this fun little point but it's more than enough to our write pretty accurately on this screen you can see and we can actually sort of get you know some different levels of pressure on the screen some lighter and some darker stuff as well which is pretty cool and really overall
it's really smooth
so even you can cross it out order file but the only possible way to erase the screen is by pressing this button and deleting everything on the screen so if you are doing something
I make a mistake
actually you know
you know the best you could do is probably take a photo but then there is actually no way to export it and you just have to clear it off when you want to do something else so
it is a bit of a pain but again as I said I mostly just use this for scribbling random things down maybe writing like a little list or something or you know if I just want to work something out on a page
Peaks later or anything
not being able to save and just having to sort of clear the whole thing off when you're done does make it a bit of a bit sort of struggle to you sometimes but as I was saying I do still enjoy using this riding tablet whenever I need something to quickly scroll or something down this is what I'm gonna go to and the fact that these are super cheap as well obviously does sweeten the deal of it for about 10 bucks or something you can pick up a writing tablet like this or similar and I'll have links to them as I said in the video description beer for about 10 bucks you can pick one of these up and honestly at that
don't forget to leave a like and subscribe down below and don't forget to check out those links we can find out some more information on these writing tablets and maybe even pick one up for yourself apart from that though thanks for watching and I'll catch you on the next video you
drive with the windows and mac driver on it so you can install the drivers straight from the USB Drive or you can download the latest driver from their website
it's quite cool for them to include an artist glove even though this is actually not that necessary because when you are drawing on a surface like this it's quite smooth it feels good
the artists glove is more helpful when you're drawing on glass surfaces like maybe on an iPad or on those glasses or face pan display but this is a very good gift to have the pen case included is very nice I love the matte surface
it may roll on the table so you may want to just put the pen stand on the table vertically like this at the two ends there are large pieces of rubber so when you put it on the table like this it has a firm grip on the table and doesn't move that easily so this is very nice
it's quite firm
I like the design
the drawing area is 10 inches by 5 point 6 inches so this is a pretty large and comfortable area to draw on and there are ample space on the side
scroll down and here
you can customize specific keyboard shortcuts to each one of them and this three lines here and these are actually indicator lights that will tell you whether or not the battery is depleting whether is in Wireless mode or whether the tablet is active this is the USB type-c port for charging the battery in this tablet
but anyway if it does run out of battery you can still use it while it's charging so you just have to connect the charging cable to the site here and just continue growing my way
it will just turn itself off once that habit is on and when the pen is hovering over the drawing area this line here you will light up the whole that distance is about 1 cm away from the surface
it uses a slider
you can assign specific
you can map the surface area of the tablet to your monitor to a portion of a monitor and this is where you can assign specific keyboard shortcuts to the six shaaka buttons on the tablet
box and click
this is quite responsive
I mean zoom in
so the curves here
let me just zoom in so some of this stroke state paper a bit more gradually compared to the strokes here this is illustrator on the Mac project sensitivity does not work by default so to get pressure working
Pro pressure sensitivity works
really well right now
using the scroll down the alternative is to press the keyboard shortcut a few times to go up and down in the size but the screw is really very effective
swiss caches
these are not really scratches that they are marks when I run my finger over them I cannot feel the stretches so not technically scratches but like marks that go over the surface the surface is still pretty smooth overall
drawing on this
I say overall a pretty good product the official retail price for this is US $99 and you can get it on Amazon or you can get it from XP pens online store if I have any updates to my review I will put them in my tax review
thanks for watching
not much has changed compared to the last version according to Amazon the ninth generation Fire HD 10 is 30% faster than its predecessor instead of a quad-core processors they're using an octa-core ship set with eight cores
according to benchmark tools it consists of 4 cortex a 73 and 4 cortex a53 course in addition to that the tablet offers 2 gigabytes of RAM and you can choose between a 32 or 64 gigabyte internal storage
my benchmark comparison shows that the single core performance is very similar but the magico performance improved a lot compared to the predecessor in Geekbench for the Fire HD 10 is even faster than the pricier Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 2019 usually
I'm also testing it
I also test multitasking
performance by running and using two apps side by side however the Fire HD 10 does not support a split-screen view if you switch between apps and mighty toss and performance is good not great but certainly good enough however because of its 2 gigabytes of RAM apps
RAM that's what I noticed when browsing the weapon chrome - if you use four tabs or more chances are at least one of them must be reloaded once you switch to it so if you do lots of multitasking this is not idea for you
I tried several games on the Amazon fire HD 10 and they all run fine basically you will be able to play almost every game with this tablet no matter if it's from the Amazon App Store or the Google Play Store occasionally
it can happen
Call of Duty
it was surprisingly where you can set the graphics settings to high and the game looks good like my benchmark comparison earlier suggested the performance is better than on the Samsung Galaxy Tab
10.1 with that one you can set the graphics to medium only in real life however it's hard to see a really difference that's what I can say about pops you more buy to it
one smoothly most of the time and you can set the graphics to HD however with both games the graphics are dynamic that means they get adjusted a bit based on the performance you can play pop G with HD settings on two tablets and they look better on the more powerful one even though the settings are the same as v 9 is another game
glass shows a new
as much for $150
the performance is good
its back fast
there's a micro
SD card slot
the screen takes all of the important aspects of a screen which makes it better than most if not all cheaper alternatives it has an IPS panel with wide viewing angles calibre production as fine as well and I really like that we are getting a fully laminated screen
I was hoping that they're going to include a split screen view now but as I said that's still not supported with one exception apps like Netflix and prime video can continue to run in a small window while you surf the web for instance Amazon customized the interface of end word a lot for Prime members that can be very useful
we get eggs
but not all
Amazon stuff everywhere
if you don't want ads at all you can pay $15 extra the Amazon Appstore has some important apps like Netflix and Spotify and you can find some interesting games too however the selection is much smaller than the one from the Google Play Store all Google apps are missing many for Microsoft are not included
that means you can install pretty much every apk you can find if you want you can also install the Google Play Store yourself that is surprisingly easy as long as you follow instructions that you can find online
I installed the Play
Store my tablet immediately because I like from video Netflix but I also want to watch YouTube and I installed many other apps using the Play Store like Call of Duty pop chameau by Lightroom Gmail and Chrome as I said you can install most Android apps because this Android
I'm looping an HD video at medium brightness and activated Wi-Fi for all of my reviews as you can see those 20 hours is an excellent result Amazon is stating a 12 hour battery life
you can get to those 20 hours when you watch a movie locally but when streaming Netflix or prime video the one time will be much lower yes I should probably update my bed retest eventually but I've been testing all tablets like this for years and it provides at least some comparable results
I don't want to put down the excellent battery life though the Fire HD 10 last long in real life - alright that's the end of my Amazon Fire HD 10 review can
I recommend this tablet
I think it's very interesting if you're a Prime member and they're using those services from Amazon or if you want to spend as little money as possible and for some Alexis a super interesting feature - since I'm only using it with the Google Play Store
I can only recommend it if you're going to install your - or if you just want it for watching from video Netflix and some games for your kids for instance the screen continues to be excellent in this price range and that's what I can say about the battery
that's the case for most other aspects - they are very similar in general however the Galaxy Tab is running Google's n word including the Google Play Store Gmail YouTube and Chrome it also supports all standard Android features like the split screen view when comparing them directly
the graphics
Android updates too
the driver supports both
Windows and Mac OS
we'll connect this later
I like the design
looks very slick
on this site
you can customize specific keyboard shortcuts to each one of them and there's this interesting trackpad it supports certain while shortcuts for example you can assign zoom in zoom out to the scrolling up and scroll down that erection and if you want to change process sizes you can also assign them to specific shortcuts
maybe laughing right
looks really cool
they behave like that
so this part here
I'm now using the tablet on Mac OS and before you install a driver you should always uninstall the graphic tablet drivers at are in your system so I have already done that
Windows as well
you can have navigation functions and if you want to you can also use the button to open application so these are the different functions that you can assign to the site buttons as well as the eight physical shortcut buttons and here you can adjust the pressure sensitivity of the pen using this pressure curve which is my preferred way to adjust pressure sensitivity compared to using the slider down
the working area of a tablet to the whole screen or to a portion of the screen by default it's mapped to the whole screen and here we have left-handed mode and right-handed mode
there's the option here
so you can customize specific keyboard shortcuts as well now in addition to customizing all these buttons you can also create shortcut groups or shortcut sets for example if you use Photoshop a lot you can customize all these shortcuts for Photoshop use and then create this group here for Photoshop shortcuts
if you use another software you can create a bunch of shortcuts for that specific software so you can just click this little plus icon here to create a different shortcut sets
you can choose from
I'm going to use the shortcut buttons now so I'm going to press this button here which goes into your razor mode and I'm going to erase on this pot here so that I can recreate this rooks or I'll yield and I'm going to hit this button here to get into the brush so it works really
now you can change it incrementally by just doing a very small swiping motion or you can change it very fast by doing it by swiping very fast and it works really well
let me show you the strokes now so pressure sensitivity works really well so you can press down hard to get thicker lines and if you press down with a little pressure to get thin lines and it's very accurate you can do cross hatching very fast
it's quite a Jo as well so it's very nice and the other thing I look out for is how well the line papers with certain tablets the lines they don't take pearl gradually they taper quite a prophecy
this is a cutting character that I drew so you can see the thin thick lines here and basically the lines they come up just the way I want them to be
this is clip studio on the Mac and project sensitivity looks really well thick lines thin lines and I can get curves to transition verse smoothly and the taper off very nicely as well
I drew so notice
same thing the lines work very nicely in lines big ones these are two files that I created on Windows this with MIDI Bank paint Pro and this with clip studio
unfortunately for me
I wasn't able to get pressure working with Photoshop and we have critter and I do not get pressure working with some of the windows to have that apps as well for example
they don't have pressure
I'm not sure why I have this issues with Windows but anyway on my website I have posted a text review for this tablet and there was someone who commented saying that it works with CorelDraw and Photoshop so this could just be an isolated incident that is specific to my setup
Windows I'm not sure why I have those issues I was only able to get pressure sensitivity working with mini-van paint Pro and clip studio but as you can see someone posted a comment my tax review saying that it works with Carell and Photoshop so I don't really understand why it's not working for me with Windows I've contacted tech support they told me to uninstall the driver reinstall again
I would love to hear from you especially if you are using this tablet we have Windows and if you have any more questions let me know in the comment section below if you want to get this tablet the link to gearbest product page will be in the video description below as well
thanks for watching
it's a 10.1
Windows 8
so it does include
I like this thing
as far as battery goes this will last a good 10 hours so pretty long time very decent on battery life and it also comes with this nice little bluetooth keyboard which also lasts a very long time however it does not have a mousepad and I kept on trying to hit a mouse down here
that's very good
other than the fact that the pixel density is not that great the pros it's very competitively priced at 7:20 $9.99 for Windows 8 tablets tablet if you want to get the newest and the best
it also runs full
if you want to now on the cons side it definitely has a lower resolution unfortunately than a lot of its competitors if you look at the Nexus 10 and the iPad that is retina
you can find other
Windows tablets on the market that have i3 processors so I would would say spend an extra fifty bucks and get an i3 processor or other than an Intel Atom for a full windows 8 experience so would I buy
I'm gonna say don't buy it's too expensive for the market at this moment however I would like to see this device because it does have some very nice features to it at a cheaper price with better processing speed and a better resolution
hello internet world
I've got something
it's a 10.1
very very nice looking tablet as you can see now run through most of the specifications but just to also let you know that that's 6,000 milliamp hour battery should keep this running for around about 15 hours combination of sort of reading browsing the internet watching movies playing games etc
so really good
it also supports the
these are the apps that come pre-installed when you get out of the box so you've got all the standard ones you'd expect including google duo keep notes and record a YouTube and YouTube music
and let's actually just start by taking a look at YouTube so we're gonna pop YouTube up here and we're gonna search for geek anoints as we do and you can see my live broadcast here
but that's lost so
I'll go back to one of the older videos and see how this performs a little bit of an advert as always and then we're gonna click through to the actual video and here we go
I did just recently
they're very very clear
Oh 8 megapixels
where's McHenry gone
it's weird sometimes
nice amount of detail nice colors in this one looks nice and natural very very pleased with that and then this this has got a lot of detail in this photo
I will say that when you're using the camera you do actually get a little bit of delight from when you push the shutter button so when it actually takes the photos so a little bit of a delay so I wouldn't use the cameras for sort of action photography
a tablet is meant for store media consumption and browsing means net doing your emails for example and I was really pleasantly surprised with the actual results from the cameras
kieu website down in the video description area also left links underneath the video to where you can buy this for yourself so again a nice browsing experience performance nice and quick to load things up and just overall very very nice experience using this tablet
if we look on this side we've got a headphone jack and then we've also got the USB C charging port and then we've also got the slot here where you can expand the memory on the bottom here
it's completely blank
and this is
IPS display
good morning to you
Andrew Williams as well
nice and lightweight
do bear in mind
please do hit that subscribe button and the notification belt so you don't miss out my future videos because I've got another video coming up in about ten minutes and it's of a smartphone that is also going to save you a lot of money and really does deliver on the quality from thanks for watching everyone
hey everybody ultimate vision
so here
it mainly consists of aluminium or aluminum metal and then you also find the camera with the LED flash and at the top view finder the plastic housing which actually allows you to insert your dual SIM cards alongside with a micro SD card slot
3G SIM cards
so yeah this is a tablet slash phone and I found it really strange at first especially considering it's 7 inches but you know it is there so you can use if you'd like and then also at the bottom
now if you just go back to the overall design why what really annoyed me was the fact that they had to write what the buttons did next to the actual button so on the volume button
and you know they don't really need to say that that is what the feature does and they've done the exact same on the power button right beneath the power button
I just really didn't think it was needed and they've also done it with the microphone and the USB charging port they've put the logos on top of or next to the actual ports now
I found that pretty pointless on the microphone port especially they put Mike on topples the Mike and I think it's pretty obvious like you're holding a phone like this
this tablet performs incredibly so moving back onto the display it has a 1920 by 1200 resolution display which is just under 1080p with a 323 pixels per inch density so this display produces some really accurate colors and as you guys can see
the colors just look really vivid especially with the thing that was already built-in with this tablet just the Condors look really really accurate especially for the price and the 323 pixels all packed into a 7-inch display just looked absolutely great on this device so if we head over to the camera at the back that's actually an 8 megapixel sensor also supported with the LED single LED flash and I have to say the rear facing camera takes some really really great photos you know
China branded products
Samsung Sony HTC Apple
I'm not gonna lie
it measures in at four point four millimeters thick and as you guys can see that's really thin so and also with the metallic design it feels really nice and compact and I don't know seven inches
I mean photos even in broad daylight or average lighting or you know even a photo in this condition now where I've got two studio lights set up on each side still don't look really good
the colors the color saturation is really really poor on the front-facing camera so I mean if they ever had to if they created a newer version of this tablet they would really really need to work on the front-facing camera because it was absolutely you know crap now moving on to the processor
you still won't find any lag on this device and I didn't even find any Nagaland this device even though I was kind of leaving apps running in the background such as browser and you know snapchat and Facebook and my David really experienced any sort of lag surprisingly so that was really good so I received the email from dhk a few weeks ago
I was kind of expecting the quality of the tablet to be really really bad and not worth the review at all but then I just said you know might as well go with it and I'm so happy that I went with them the opportunity to review this tablet because I think the stereotype of all cheap tablets from China being bad is not true because this tablet is very very far from bad and I think that the average consumer like me and you watching the video would buy this tablet
it's a completely unknown brand and the price of well one hundred and ninety six dollars you may have that type of money line about and in the UK that's around 150 145 pound roughly and this tablet performs really really
Samsung's Galaxy Tab 7
you know sorry
i'd advise you guys to read through the specs and you know take a look at some of the pictures and hopefully from this review you guys may be convinced or not whether to buy it or not
it has a lot of positive features and you know it may seem hard to believe that this tablet is from china and its really good but it is so yeah
you may be impressed with what you get so yeah thanks for watching this video guys make sure to hit the thumbs up button and i will see you all in the next video
hey everybody it's LAN Seidman and we're taking a look today at lenovo's answer to the Microsoft Surface this is the ThinkPad tablet x1 and it's got some similarities to the surface but it does some things a little bit better which we will cover of course in the course of this review but I do want to mention in the interest of full disclosure that this came in to the channel on loan from Lenovo so when I'm done reviewing it it goes back to them
so let's get into the hardware here and then we'll see how it performs so this is a tablet of course and it can be detached from its included keyboard much like the Microsoft Surface can be so pretty thin design here pretty lightweight also
this is one point
it's very satisfying
I'm seeing here on the side but it's nice and bright pretty much in line with a lot of other displays I've seen from Lenovo this is AF HD+ 2160 by 1440 so I guess it's not quite quad
HD but it is better than a standard HD display but not quite as high resolution as that 4k display we saw on a similar computer from Dell the other day
Core M processor
so when you're on a laptop kind of mode it actually is easier to use because I don't feel like I'm balancing the device on my lap when I'm using it
nice design in here
through-and-through same size
it has that same think pad kind of feel with really nice travel on the keys which is nice also considering how thin this keyboard dock is it does come with it
you get the keyboard dock and a pen along with the tablet of course for thirteen hundred and forty-nine dollars in this particular mode you get the same trackpad you see on a number of other thing pads along with a little nub here so if you would like to navigate your computer with your little red thing here you can do that on this version as well
also which you can activate by just hitting the function key and the spacebar so you do have all the accoutrements of a full-fledged laptop yet you have this very small form-factor my only gripe with the keyboard is that it does kind of bend a little bit when you're in this mode here so the keyboard does give a little bit as you can see especially when you're kind of in the middle here
it does do that a little bit but it is very comfortable to type on surprisingly so even on a lap and there are a couple of ports worth mentioning including a USB type-c port which is on the side here so you've got a USB type-c which is both for USB devices as well as charging you have a USB 3.0 port over here there are stereo speakers on it one on each side so this is this one and there's the other one over here not very loud actually
sound out of this
there's a headphone microphone
lock as well
on the top
I do really like that latching mechanism there but you get about probably five or six hours provided you turn the display down pretty decently and you're not taxing the processor too heavily so I was
form factor is that you really can't fit a lot of battery in here and still have the same weight and size so you are going to get about five or six hours but one of the docks that they're coming out with that will sit in between the keyboard and the tablet is a extended battery dock
but if you want to go all day with it you'll probably need to buy that particular device to get yourself additional battery life so now we're gonna take a look at its performance
we're going to start with the pen and then we'll go in and look at all the other stuff we usually look at so this is the pen that it comes with
dock here if you want to store it while you're walking around with it they also have another little piece of plastic that will plug into the USB 3 port
I get the pen
I'm using OneNote right now and as I draw on the screen here you'll see the pen will get thicker the harder I push so it does have some decent pressure sensitivity on it also so a very thinner line here and then I can push down harder and get a thicker line
even if my fingers were touching the screen it just ignores the fingers and looks for the pen input as you're writing on it so pretty nice little pen here and a good alternative
we've got that
AC Wireless built in
the display is very very sharp so this is not a 4k display but it's slightly better than HD so when you are playing back 4k videos like this it will look really really nice
going on here we'll go load up the stats for nerds to get confirmation on that and we're running just fine with no drop frames and really really nice image quality here
I'm very impressed with the the balance of this display both in its color and contrast really really nice to look at and some decent web performance as well out of this and on the octane benchmark test which we run on Google Chrome on all of our devices here on the channel
I wish I still had it here to do a test to figure out why that was such a disparity but unfortunately I don't have it here any longer so I will just have to see take this result for what it is it is slightly slower than the Dell XPS 12
I'm not sure what's going on here but I haven't really noticed any issues with browsing the web articles come up very quickly as on the New York Times here as they do on other sites you saw with the YouTube example there
here too now
this is our usual template that we look at a newsletter template that has a lot of text and graphics as rendering very quickly as I'm scrolling through everything so that is a good sign that we've got some good productivity performance here
I'm doing here
all of those things will run quite well but games are another story because these don't really have the graphical horsepower to support a lot of the modern games out there but it is possible to do some gaming on it we're going to take a look at Minecraft and we're going to look at some movies also and see how well you can use this as a high bitrate movie
playback device and minecraft is running pretty well on here surprisingly so we're getting frame rates well above 60 right now and that is running at the full 2160 by 1440 resolution
this is running with the Optifine performance enhancing plugin which does give us a little bit of a boost but anybody can get that plug-in to run so I think for casual games
it puts it almost identical in its performance to the Dell XPS 12 that we looked at a couple of weeks ago so that one I really lined up quite nicely between the two
playing here right now
this is the full movie that came right off a blu-ray disc it's 37 gigabytes in size very high bitrate running off an SSD over there so it seems to be running just fine
I was checking the frame rates earlier and it is able to keep up as you would expect it to so really good performance out of there and have to say overall
this is the one
I think I could live with the most because it does work well on a lap and that's been the one issue that I've seen with a number of these that they haven't really performed all that well as laptops because you have to balance things a little bit differently because there's so many different components that move around but this one really does nicely and I think it's because of the kickstand and how it's designed because it is relatively flat back here and it's not you know cropping itself up on
Performing device overall with the corium processor battery life isn't the best again about 5 or 6 hours but they will have those modules you can stack on to get better battery life in the near future there and if you like the ThinkPad keyboards you will get one on here again
I'm just a little bit concerned with the fact that it you know moves so much as you're typing on it but if you are looking for something in this form factor this is a really nice design here from lenovo
this is lines
shebeen if you want to help the channel you can by contributing as little as a dollar a month head over to Lam TV slash patreon to learn more and don't forget to subscribe visit lanza TV slash s
it's a 10-inch
it has 1024 by 600 resolution for the screen and go ahead and get into just a quick unboxing of this tablet here so we have an instruction booklet and it looks like information on how to get support in the tablet
here's tablet itself
headphone jack and here
we have two micro
so if we go ahead and around the tablet here and we take a look at settings this tablet has 16 gigabytes of space but as far as the actual use usable space
so if we also take a look at about tablet down at the bottom here in settings we see that as a quad-core processor and runs Android 5.0 point 2 which is lollipop
I know a lot of people who buy this tablet myself included will want to use it to play movies and TV shows so I wanted to show a trailer and this is the trailer for the newest James Bond movie
and it's pretty responsive
so that's just roughly
and it's it stays in pretty snugly too but there's this flap right here which you can put around the side just like that and then when you close it just close up closes up like this and so you can
so it's pretty portable
here it's removable
so if you need to put the tablet further out you can and then you can put the keyboard right here or you can just kind of snap it into place there
right here
so it's decently accurate
the the connection
so you can connect any Bluetooth devices you have such as headphones speakers if you have a Bluetooth keyboard you can also connect that and battery life visual and rates it at eight hours and I've been getting about seven and a half hours with moderate usage so overall I really like this tablet
thanks for watching
what's happening everyone
around 9,000 milliamp battery
that means that you're gonna be able to get updates right from Microsoft and I actually got a whole bunch of updates for this tablet and you also have access to the Windows Store and that means that you can just download apps and games from that
it's awesome to type on it because it's so big but in the same time it's kind of awkward to hold because it's just too big so it's nice to do certain things with it but it's kind of big and I wish those bezels
it's made out of plastic and it's kind of easy to scratch so be careful when you place this down and what touches the screen because it's very very easy to get it scratched and I mean after you pay like 200 bucks
they have a micro USB port we also have one of the speakers we have the HDMI out USB C port a USB 3 port and lastly the port for the power adaptor on the other side
we have the three point five mil we also have a slot for an SD card the second speaker and although at the top pump we have the power button and the volume keys
you can also get a keyboard for it and I believe that's 20 bucks more and that would basically attach to the bottom of the tab and I kind of wish I have got a keyboard for it because it would make it look more like a notebook
I don't like about the tablet is the fact that you cannot charge it from the USB port so Hiro USB 3 here here will USB C port but you cannot charge it from those ports so you always have to plug it in with a power adapter that comes with it and I mean if you're traveling and you have like a power bank you're not gonna be able to charge it from a power bank and that kind of sucks another thing
I mean if you're in a quiet room you can hear the tablet just fine but if you're in a noisy place well it's very difficult to hear but again you could plug in some headphones or connect them some headphones over
no matter how you look at it so the viewing angles are really really good done on it and it gets bright enough so you can see it in most places
so it's gonna be a bit difficult to see outside but the screen does seem to get bright enough so you can use it in most places the touch screen sensitivity even though it's not as good as you would find on a smartphone
I've tried in the past and we are moving on to performance so I've done a few benchmark tests because there's curious to see what scores I'll get on this one compared to other devices that have the Intel and 3450 so the scores that I got on Cinebench are about ten fifteen percent lower than the scores that I got for other devices using the Intel and 3450 moving on to pass mark
once again
the score is a bit lower than other devices the Intel and 3450 and lastly on the gig bench for the same story to score us a bit lower now
I notice that if you use the tablet and you do those benchmark tests right when you start up the tablet so if the tablet is been sitting for a while and it's cold the scores are actually higher so it has to do the heating inside the tablet because the tablet does get quite hot
we have about 35 37 exam left in the speech that I got for the internal storage are somewhat better than other mini pieces that I've tried in the past however not that exceptional comparing this with other mini pieces that use the same processor so the Intel and 3450
this is somewhat slower
it's only 1080p no Wi-Fi it's not fast enough so you can actually watch a 4k video without buffering so the tablet is gonna stop every 30 seconds to buffer so the best resolution to watch videos
that means that you can use the voice assistant and that one works good but you have to be pretty close to the tablet and for it to pick up on whatever you're saying and we also have got 2 megapixel front-facing camera
I tried a few video files and all of them did them fairly good and I was quite surprised to see that the 4k file at 60 frames per second
what you do with it if you keep the Bluetooth phone if you keep the Wi-Fi on all the time if you play games and so on so it really depends from person to person but you should be able to get 2 to 3 days easily from that nine thousand million buried
I love the screen
I love how bright it is and it just looks good and everything that you do on the screen looks awesome now the not-so-good about the tablet is the fact that we cannot use any of those USB ports to charge the tablet so every time you want to charge the tablet you need to use that power adapter and that just sucks because you can't charge it in the car you can't charge it on the go and so on so that's definitely a disadvantage
the speakers aren't the best but again you're gonna probably use like headphones and that's not gonna be a big issue and the tablet is not the fastest out there in gets kind of hot and
I'm imagining that
thanks for watching
what's happening everyone
outers so this one
it is made by a company called zonko and you can find this tablet for about $70 so very affordable but of course when you buy a $70 tablet there are some disadvantages but we are going to be talking about everything so first of all the screen so this is a 10.1 inches IPS panel the 1280 by 800 resolution
so just over 720p
the colors look good
but you're not going to be able to use this tablet outdoors because the screen doesn't get that bright however if you are using the tablet indoors you shouldn't have any issues now whenever you are watching videos on YouTube
the tablet has a GPS unit inside and that means that you can use this for navigation in the car for example and it can also take two SIM cards but we only get on 3G connectivity but 3G is better than no connectivity
and you may be running out of space pretty quick considering that all apps these days are pretty big we even get 2 speakers but both speakers are sitting on the back of the tablet there for pointing away from you not to mention
they get fairly loud but they sound super tiny but at least the tablet has a 3.5 million jack so you can use some headphones and the sound or output from that 3.5 millimeter is decent
isn't that amazing
either so you can get between three and three hours and a half of screen on time and I guess that's good enough so you can watch two movies but not more than that and charging this from zero to 100 is done above 4 hours so it takes fairly long to charge them as well so you may want to use like a power bank connected to it whenever you are watching something so you don't run out of power performance-wise well this is pretty slow but I was kind of expecting that
so this tablet this is using the media takes 65 80 which is a very old processor therefore the score that we get on the antutu benchmark in the Geekbench for our very low and actually the lowest that I've seen in the last three years I think so you're gonna need a lot of patience to do anything with the time in when you open the browser it takes a few seconds to load the browser
this is a very slow tablet and it's ideal for watching movies at 480p basically the Wi-Fi connectivity is also decent but the tablet doesn't support dual band Wi-Fi so you can only connect to a 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi bands
I would never buy this but I imagine that there are a lot of people that need them something to watch movies on or something like that and the before that
I think it's gonna be okay if you don't have high expectations but if you have any any kind of high expectations from this this is definitely not gonna do that
thanks for watching
I should mention overall
If the company likes the review the artist made, they send that artist increasingly more expensive tablets because they know that person will do a good job giving them basically free marketing.
So there’s always a little bit of pressure for a reviewer receiving the product for free to do what the company says. If you’re planning to buy a tablet, the other thing you should watch out for is the fact many of these companies tell reviewers to give them five stars on Amazon.
I buy their tablet from Amazon with my own money so that my review would be marked as a verified purchase, and then the company would Paypal me the purchase cost.
As a basis
That’s it.
But other companies have a lot of questionable, ever-changing rules, and kind of sneaky ways to get you to do as much for free for them as you’re willing to do.
Some demand video descriptions
be a certain way.
And they police this.
If you send a company your review, they may make recommendations for you to change your video, remove parts where you say negative things, or mention features or special sale prices you did not mention.
Even if they don’t outright censor your review, the process of fixing your video creates more work for you. I’ve always said no to any changes like this - you should too.
That’s actually illegal
This is product testing.
They don’t.
When a company says they’ll send you a tablet if you give a positive review, you can say, “I’m happy to review your tablet but I do not guarantee positive reviews” and they’ll usually work with you anyway.
Most companies don’t care if you include critical points about their tablet in your review, as long as you also cover what the tablet does well. As a reviewer, the most important thing is to say no to anything you don’t want to do.
I did.
reviews: it costs me more to make them than I get in return, I’m tired of being used as free marketing, and I don’t want to be a product review channel.
but you need to come here to see the accessories you want to see the tablet itself so let me get my hands on and show you around so when here's a close-up shot of the Galaxy Note 10 one before I show off some of the software and features
4 quad core
SOC there are four cortex a9 cores running it up to 1.4 gigahertz there is 2 gigabytes of RAM in this unit most Android slates have one gig or 512
Meg's so that's a nice upgrade by Samsung and there's also an arm Mali 400 MP 4 GPU in here it's a quad-core GPU as well so fairly powerful graphics 2 out of the box it's running Android Ice Cream Sandwich but Samsung tells us a jellybean
update is coming
and as we mentioned in the intro it's a 10.1 inch screen but the resolution is only 1280 by 800 that was standard fare for about the last year on Android tablets but Apple and soos have upped the ante so a little bit disappointed in that resolution although the screen is a very nice quality brightness and contrast they're very good
images look great
you're likely to notice
Note 10 one
we're going to show you those next as we've already mentioned the Galaxy Note 10 one is running Android Ice Cream Sandwich out of the box specifically version 404 but it's also running Samsung's TouchWiz on top of the OS now
TouchWiz is fairly clean
Android experience TouchWiz
the screen is very responsive to touch works very well but let me show you some of the cool things available with TouchWiz so first I'm going to show you multi-screen let me bring up the browser here
now here
you see the stock
Note 10 one if I press this button right up here the list of apps is going to pop down and if I press one of them let's do s note
the browser works
Polaris Office s
note the video player the multimedia gallery and the stock email app not the Gmail app just this stock email app so it's not universally useful but it is something that Samsung offers that others don't so you can have two apps side by side
it's great if you want to transcribe something from a webpage say into s note and on top of this you have an additional tray of apps that will pop up in their own windows so if you want a calculator you can bring that up and have that also running so you want to bring up the task manager
it's not great but with the s-pen it's like you're writing on paper so if you want to do you know character recognition or select parts of an image to drag and drop between apps
note 10 one but we also have a full write-up up on the site at hot hardware with examples from the video camera still photos and a full suite of benchmarks and battery life
USB port and a micro HDMI connection as well as the connectivity dock for the gaming adapter features Windows 10 home it has a dedicated button for in-game recording and then there's the dock itself the gaming dock that is emulates an Xbox one controller it's also compatible with PC games and steam the buttons AV X from Y are backlit trigger controls are excellent and it even has the Rumble feedback built-in dual analog sticks for your thumbs for a real true gaming experience on the go with an 8 inch LCD screen
that has a 1200 by 800 screen resolution the Lynx vision 8 allows all of the top gaming titles available on Xbox one to be stream directly to the Lynx vision even when the TV is busy you can play all of your favorite game
that's not a problem if you don't have a network that's not a problem either with the Windows Store you have access to hundreds of thousands of games that can be played natively downloaded directly to the Lynx is an 8 without network access with Windows 10 with Windows 10
also the full
yes it's been out for a few years and I'm just letting my hands on one but there are no US sellers that I've been able to find even on Amazon
but what's the point
I mean handily all at this point from iPads to Nexus to Kindle and the links with Windows 10 is excellent pairing that with the ability to sync and play games for my xbox in steam
it's great now
the color is okay
it's certainly nowhere
the tablet speakers are clear but they don't have any depth to the base which doesn't matter if you're using a decent headset the only other issue that I had was when I used the chat feature over Xbox Live the tablets internal mic
so that you could let your hands more flat and tilt the screen towards you or away from you etc but I understand the reason for them not being that way while the cradle works well the button placement
the new layout feels a little bit alien to start with but if your Xbox if your Xbox one is occupied you know the TV is occupied and you can't use it and you want to sit on the back porch or by the pool or laying in the bed or whatever you know your kids watching Netflix and you want to play xbox
it works very well
you can't beat the layout of a good old fashioned controller though while streaming a suffered very little lag at least nothing that I could notice and while I won't be using this setup to play competitively online or anything like that it does offer excellent single-player solace when you can't get to the TV
the controller input suffered a little bit of delay with characters walking a little bit farther than I had pressed but it was so sporadic that I just put it down to my home network being kind of limited and kind of crappy the Lynx vision 8 is powerful enough to run the full desktop version of Windows 10 a PC desktop computer
I think I had it running between 5 and 10 hours depending on what you're doing obviously streaming is going to really wear the battery down but if you're doing other things playing games that are native to the system itself you're not going to wear it down as fast the Lynx vision 8 is a great budget tablet it is Windows 10
Windows 10 is a joy to use on the tablet and in desktop mode and as as if the Xbox streaming wasn't enough just being able to play Windows 10 PC and mobile games and stream some Steam games
I'll leave you here as you watch me play a little bit of Ghost Recon wildlands on streaming from my xbox one and just let you know these tablets normally run anywhere from 120 to 200 dollars if you're able to find them on eBay or something like that
great tablet though
I really enjoyed using mine and I recommend you know picking one up especially if you can get one for around 120 to 150 so I appreciate you taking the time to watch
relax and let me tell you all about it but first let me show you what comes in the box you get the charging brick you get a USB cable you get the user's guide and warranty card in multiple languages and you get the tablet now that I show you what comes in a box
you do have a headphone jack and the USB charging on the right side of the tablet you have your power button and your volume up and down rocker and on the bottom
you have a microphone on the back side of tablet you'll find a 5 megapixel camera with a 2.0 f-stop the Asus logo and also this nice little plastic covering around it on the front of the tablet
this tablet also supports
it has 21.3
ace is also partnered with Google so by buying this you're going to get 100 gigabytes of storage for two years and that can be used for files and also photos the software from the factory is Android 6.0
the first thing you do is press and hold the power button until it turns on when you get the welcome screen go ahead and choose your language and then hit next now
it says connect it going to press next now read through the terms and conditions press next and then agree if you had a previous tablet then you can restore your data or you can set up as a new tablet as a fresh start now you can enter your gmail account or skip it but keep in mind to download applications
what services that you want to install by unchecking it if you don't like it and then press next next you can protect your device with a PIN number a pattern or password
then hit next
I'll choose a pattern
it's gonna have all these different icons on it to remove it press and hold and drag these items off the screen to customize this you can start by pressing the hold down the screen and you get this pop-up we're going to click on wallpapers and you can do live wallpapers
from the three lines
I put Chrome if you hold it down you can drag it where you want and to do widgets hit the three lines press widget and find out which one you like so for example if I want this clock I can press and hold it down
let me show you some of the menus in the tablet if you drag your finger down from the top you hit the gear looking icon and this is where you can see all your different settings you can connect your Wi-Fi Bluetooth see your data
your notification change sounds
it's not that loud but it's still tablet so it's not bad so let's try the headphones now when I listen to the headphones audio sound very crisp and very detailed so I've got to imagine what how good it sounds when you have the DTX headphones on let me show you another piece of cool software that I found this tablet
you can make slideshows movies and a couple other things here but under movies you can go in and add clips that you want to add to your show and then hit the arrow over and then you can start chopping it up putting titles and things like that on it now
it sells for less than $150 and I'll leave a link in the description below if you own one or having comments please do that below this video and like out my videos before give me a thumbs up
point of 449
the a500 competes most directly with the Motorola Xoom Wi-Fi 10.1 inch tablet rather than the rise in version because this guy has no 3G though to make nerds a little bit confusing the box says 8500 but if you do a check of the software status on this it identifies itself as the a 501 which will be the 18 t 3G version and it has a SIM card slot though Acer has put a piece of grey plastic tape over the slot to make sure you don't drop anything in there because there's actually no sim card receiver inside the slot so if you drop it in there you'll have a sim card rattling around
don't try it also
interestingly it shows that power consumption is used by the Android operating system as always when it's idle Wi-Fi and cell standby even though there is no 3G radio at least there's no sim card holder as in card in speaking of that
grates right here
you can see
there is a little gap in the case on that end but very tight on this end here and on this side a little reset all USB port with USB hub we can plug in things like flash drives which we've done and yes it does work really cool
there's your micro USB port for syncing your power on this side a micro HDMI out the 720p out with a software update from Google will see 1080 headphones 3.5 millimeter stereo
Jack your power button
you got a 10.1 inch capacitive despite here 1280 by 800 resolution which is pretty standard for 10.1 inch and it's a nice sharp display that's only less identical to the Motorola Xoom
inch displays
affordable is by not trying to squeeze down the size quite so much terms of thickness they're both very similar but the Acer looks thinner cuz it does with the iPad 2 does it
there's a side view
we do have a shell case on the iPad but it adds very little thickness on the side there and the iPad is a bit lighter the the Acer is surprisingly heavier than it feels like
it's almost 1.7 pounds
even though it's heavier something about the balance of it though nature did a really good job with that in terms of performance and dying of the ACA 500 really wins for 450 bucks
Tegra 2 and video CPU and a gig of ram and it certainly is a fast enough tablet benchmark similarly to the Motorola Xoom which has the same CPU no surprise it gets about 2040 on quadrant
it gets 41 on
what a stirrer has done is kind of created a custom backdrop folders for Suites of applications you see II reading games multimedia and social down here and of course they're cleaned up cleared off
we'll talk about later
and if see because it's a reading they've done a little background for that folder basically so you've got Google Books access right here and Lumiere II now here makes Lumiere eat you eaters overseas and that's where the name comes from
and now you've got links here to some free books or places that do offer free books and you can get them from there or you can shop in the store but not so much here is
let's go do that
it's a web browser
requirement feed books
we've got cute
page turn animations probably
it's pretty giant
likewise you might be able to do this with an external micro SD card as well if you had one installed when you're running this either way should work speaking of site loading
you can just plug this into a Windows computer and it just mounts as a drive if you're using a Mac you have to download from Google of free application it's Android file transfer for honeycomb products because the Mac can't see Android Honeycomb OS products without that little application
there is no side loading of books a lot in Google Books at this point unfortunately I do hope they add that feature but it's certainly attractive and if you want to get any of those two million or some public domain books our paper bucks from the Google bookstore
we've got photo browser
say inside your house
it's cute
of course you can play videos through gallery as well and this has photos music and video and that just gives you access to your photos yet again no back
then we've got a full 1080 trailer on here so let's see how it handles in and it is doing an absolutely terrible child playing that 1080 trailer how hot is that let's check out the gallery application and see how it does in standard Android gallery for playing that same video
well let locally start
1080p video
didn't go too well
really lovely interface here
it's doing better here
I'll take a look at the web browser which of course supports full flash Adobe Flash 10.2 and will use the cool multitasking bar over here to select our browser from the list
you can see here
it comes with honeycomb
yes we expect and we will take a look at a video review of the LG G slate to see flash playback so we've parallel flash player controls down here and with honeycomb
the browser is excellent
it doesn't the game
very nice now
I need for speed shift to your work during our training run nice graphics good sound thirty's the control of the accelerometer the HR Iconia has a 30 260 milliamp battery
that's sealed inside
it doesn't pop out like it doesn't a cell phone for example and we're still putting it through our battery test but so far it looks like battery life should probably on part the Motorola Xoom then say maybe seven hours so our unit seems to have a little bug where it keeps waking itself up and turning the screen on and even after hard resetting it twice
it's still doing that
we assume that's just a fluke with this particular unit it also has a GPS that works with Google Maps and you can use the webcam with Google Talk for video chatting and it performed pretty well in our test for them
notice of course a lot more to the unit that we can even cover here so be sure to visit mobile tech review to rear a full review and I'm Lisa and this is the Acer Iconia a 500 10.1 inch Android tablet available now at Best Buy and other places for 449
and it's actually pretty good so starting with the build quality of this thing it's metal it feels decent it doesn't feel like the highest-quality metal it does feel pretty similar to the Xiaomi me pad 3 which in and out in and of itself was a pretty decent built tablet so you have the back here
you have her camera
you have a mini
oh sorry not microphone
so that's one thing that you do have to be aware of the fingerprints show pretty easily even on the metal but it does feel pretty good now on the front side here we have the actual tablet itself
bezels are fairly big
they're not too small
I mean they're fine
it's obviously not the most high quality tablet in the world but it will suffice for most if not all people alright let's check out this quick video of Japan in 8k four by three aspect ratio and as you can see it actually displays very decent colors the tech lass
that's decent screens
you get screens
I mean I think
when you're reading at night before you go to bed you actually are able to sleep easier with night mode on because there is less blue light going into your eyes and this night mode is very common now in many phones they all have it and in my opinion it really works and I use it a lot as well
so yeah there's really not much else to say the touch sensitivity on this display is excellent the screen brightness is not it's barely usable in bright light so yep so that's about it and let's move on to the audio so before we move on to an audio clip from this device and I want to talk a little bit about the audio
it's not as bad as what you find in here but other than the lack of bass in a weird way the rest of the audio is fine and it's really no problem
there's one more thing
I want to show you that you might not be to here but when you type here you will be able to hear the actual key taps but it's not even some of them are louder and some of them are softer
maximum of screen on time if you put it down to like lowest brightness and you're reading night mode you know and pitch darkness in your bedroom then you can stretch it to about eight hours but seven hours is about the maximum and my me pad three could get around eight hours
stand my battery life
I left it for
so that is good and let's move on to the software alright so software here we have Android but it is not the latest version of Android it's Android 7.0
it works well
Chrome was super fast
that's also instant
most of the time
I don't know why but it is able to play ashphalt extreme in theory of course and I'm sure it can in real life as well if it's able to launch
I didn't see any crashes in any of the other games I played and it only ashphalt extreme so the last thing to talk about here is the Wi-Fi reception while reception is good and this really
I like it a lot and it's very very cheap and the value you get the performance you get and the user experience you get is definitely worth 150 bucks that you will pay for this tablet
I would recommend you get the Lenovo Tab 8 + Tab 3 8 plus instead of this but this is a very nice habit with a very high resolution and at some point 9h Street so if you want to get this I do understand I do have links down below if you want to check it out so be sure to hit like and subscribe
be sure to hit that little notification button to make sure you're notified of any of the latest videos that come out thanks so much for watching and I'll see you guys in the next one you
well on today's episode
you can start by hitting the subscribe button clicking the bell icon so you get notified every time we post a new video so the connect X 10.1 inch quad-core calling tablet
comm is advertised differently so it has different specifications compared to the one that we're going to be reviewing today and I'm not sure if that is an advertising error or the tablet for sale on tequila comm is a previous model to this but this tablet is also available from other retailers such as - cop macro and there's a full list on the connect X website where you can find out where these devices are available so at first glance this is damn heavy and some of the main points listed on the box it has a 10.1 inch touchscreen display it runs Android 7.0
T little charged up with charging cable right and there isn't much to say about a charging charging cable or what I did like is that they gave us an OTG transfer cable so this cable you can plug it into the tablet and actually plug in a USB so you could transfer instead of connecting your tablet to a PC to transfer files to it
you could copy it to the USB and plug the USB into your tablet and that I find very convenient as a student I really like that this came with the templates right the OTG transfer cable which is very handy
so the next thing is our enormous tablet with its case and if you open it up the case is actually a keyboard as well as the tablet comes with a screen protector
RAM it's 10.1
it has a 3.5
mm stereo jack
when this is recorded it still had about 30 percent battery with no charges in between if screen is very bright and it is very excellent for watching videos as a student so
I shouldn't have to even talk about the fact that it comes with a keyboard and a screen protector and I must say this is not slow compared to other tablets when you start doing multiple when you start multitasking and downloading and stuff this didn't slow down even after while I was downloading and doing updates and actually trying to get work done
I have noticed
protector does feel kind of funny on my fingers but I'm not sure why it felt very funny with me using it and I'm not sure why and playing music a well not playing music well while doing watching movies the speakers weren't so great but you wouldn't expect excellent quality audio for something at this reasonable price so it could be improved but it's it's possible as a student
let's say a small cap with you doing most of your day so if you are thinking of purchasing this as I said the audio quality coming out of the speakers isn't so great and may I suggest taking a look at the volcano phonics series wireless bluetooth headphones

thanks for watching
same place next week
we can see that
this tablet already runs on android 10. it has 4 gigabytes of ram and 64 gigabytes of storage it features a 10.1 inch full hd ips lcd screen the tecla p20 hd is worth 6149 pesos
was netflix
um i know it's an unusual name but my mother is rather a fan of word games and the notice felt backwards reads well and yet we were always together
you can clearly see yourself but it does have ghost movement when you move too fast so in terms of gaming i tried genji impact but the game just wouldn't load either
i can't recommend it
this makes it difficult to draw with a tip that i want to share with you guys is to go to settings about phone and find the thing that says build number tap that as many times as you can until you can get the developer option
i suggest not changing too much because you might destroy your phone or you might do something that you might regret but instead just scroll down and find the animation scales option
thank you for watching
Firealpaca where you can adjust the stabilizer setting click "flicks", then adjust it from relaxed to precise and just click "apply" and "ok" and click the "pen and touch" and click "change tablet pen settings" then click the "hardware and sounds" and you can also adjust pressure by clicking "control panel" then by clicking you can already adjust the pressure sensitivity by tuning it to your desired output from hard to soft
you can also click the download to install the 1-day trial of paint tool sai click "finish" click "tablet setup" and click ok and just keep on clicking open "file manager" and click the "cd drive" the light indicator in the tablet should turn on then plug it in your laptop plug it in the micro usb port woops
i bought it for
P1,055/21.11 usd free shipping
Lazada for today's video
i'm going to review
and your authority
why is that well
flank of a stand is the 8 megapixel camera continuing our journey rightward to the bezel the volume rocker micro USB port and also power button is found all sporting that attractive brush aluminum style
just look great and the yoga too does a great job at using it the processor that I uses sounds like something you'd expect in a computer or a tablet running Windows not Android typically we see the Snapdragon powering most of Android devices lenovo decided to go with intel intel was a leader in computer processing lenovo opted to go with the Intel Atom 1.3 gigahertz 2 gigabytes of ddr3 for memory intensive apps and also 16 gigabytes of on-board with an optional SD card slot that expands up to 64 gigabytes the two large front-facing speakers that I mentioned in the design section aren't just there for looks it has Dolby audio built into it and also Wolfson Master HiFi
I hate to say this but I did attempt to bend it just because I felt some flex when carrying at one time the yoga 2 does flex a bit and I'm not sure if it's because it's doing yoga or the plastics and internals aren't able to withstand a large amount of pressure
well when using the 8 inch almost all the performance lag that I had with the 10 inch is gone opening applications flipping between screens multitasking and multi window applications all felt smooth
one thing that you will continue to notice is that transition are not as smooth it just feels a bit choppy but that does not take away from the speed
Riptide to cross erodes all ran with the consistent high frames per second and also great responsiveness as I do with the written reviews all the benchmark scores are linked down below in the written companion piece
Android 4.4.2 kitkat
Lenovo calls bottom switch
the bottom switch gives you tacos like Wi-Fi autorotation airplane mode GPS and a few other things it also has a brightness control camera lockscreen screenshot and Lenovo smart switch
are okay at best
some people may argue that a camera on a tablet isn't important but if you actually look at the statistics and you walk around and see people are using a camera on any device they have and a lot of people
and it's something
they use for photography especially older people since the screen is a lot bigger for them to use so the manufacturers have to provide tools for the way that people are using their devices
so that's why tablet photography is turning into a real thing and a lot of companies are actually putting money and putting technology into tablet cameras so this is a trend that is going upwards
and you're going to see a lot more devices coming with cameras on them and you're also going to see a lot more enhanced features on the tablets even versus the phone and that was my review of the yoga 2 tablet now
of course this tablet isn't the fastest tablet in the world or it actually isn't the smoothest tablet but for $250 to get a nice multimedia tablet that has a pretty decent processor in there and it's really good for games and also exceptional battery life
subscribe to our YouTube channel and also check out our other videos from everyone and the background making Android Authority possible as always guys my name is Kevin the tech ninja this is Android authority your source for all things
Android take care
nice colors on there
so it's not the high res screen obviously the Nexus 7 or the iconic or the ASA tab that I reviewed recently but it is very clear and perhaps not not too reflective either
it's definitely not reflective
it's got a 1.8 gigahertz Intel Atom processor so yeah not really running the Snapdragon or anything like that on the Atom processor with 1gb ram so the one gig around is a bit on the skinny side for but for a budget tablet
which like I said
well you can't see any fingerprints on there whereas if I get my links tablet and you see the fingerprint show up on there so they've done a good job with the coating on that so switching from app to app there's a slight lag every now and again that's probably down to the wonky
the one keep memory as well as the processor and it's probably not snappy some of the other tablets that I've played with although my Nexus 7 is really slow now since putting kick out on that and this is shown say this runs kick out as well Android for for not under of Android 5
the material design yet
Asus said yes
I'm not really keen on those kind of things so we've got a two megapixel rear camera which when I finish this video I will like take a couple of shots with this outside and I'll include them a link that goes on the dish lifestyle
get a little bit on the slow side as it loads up and I've seen this a lot faster on other devices and I know that the the network is good so it's bit on the slow side
I'm actually there
that's clear actually
Android is just cost
you've got this a notepad or whether you can collapse calculator and calendar so and kind of an extra thing that you can have on there so you got quick access to those
yeah there you go
I found here
so you've got it
I miss that one
this seems fairly reasonable
that's not so good but it's ok and then if I switch back to browser see there is a bit of lag on there but it's loaded now so the performance on the side of it is quite good some so overall I quite like this
I'm attending choose
it's not expensive
I'll probably put a link with this and almost and also at the battery life so I'll probably put a link to the DS lifestyle that come with it when I've spent some time actually testing CL on The Bachelor life yeah you get the Android you get some of the bloatware apps which is out there so in need but the screen is OK
starting at just $279
I'm and reformed on
I'm reviewing pretty much
you can connect use
that's certainly a downside
the front-facing camera is missing some detail when recording HD videos you can record with 1600 by 1200 pixels - which looks better but it's not the 16 by 9 aspect
ratios that videos
that's fantastic because it was pretty much every competitor you will have to pay at least $100 extra for a keyboard so the price of $279 are super competitive because it includes the keyboard with the back covers
it's made of plastic - and does not feel as high-end as a tight cover for micros or instance but as I said these costs at least $100 so it's okay because of the 10 inch screen
Chrome OS used to be an operating system that relies heavily on the cloud and it still does mostly but by now you can install and what apps from the Google Play Store and you can use them locally just like with an Android tablet Chrome OS is based on Linux
just as and word is and it's said to be very secure one reason why this so secure is that it will get updates for a long time in fact the lenovo droid chromebook should be updated until June of 2028
yes ideas that means
it's fully desktop class
Chrome so it's not a mobile version we know from Android instead it looks and works just as Chrome for Windows or Mac OS stars and you can use the same extensions to chrome wants much better on this tablet then it doesn't similar price to Windows devices demanding web apps like Gmail Google Docs and Netflix one great
sometimes we've got to wait a second when switching to a full screen for example but it performs much better than on similar price windows tablets which often have to fight with YouTube
we're getting a desktop class browser with which you can do pretty much everything that you're doing on the PC without having to make compromises that you have to make with mobile versions as I said Google
Docs performs very well and you can leave YouTube running in the background tab and listen to the audio without it stopping just like on a PC and without you too premium
Android tablets here
not all but most
a couple of games as well as note-taking apps they work just as they do on an Android tablet by the way you can also install different browsers like Microsoft edge or Firefox but since chrome is a major highlight of this tablet
Linux apps on this tablet in the settings you've got to activate this feature first once you've done that you can use the terminal to install Linux apps and you son that means in addition to Android apps you can also use traditional desktop apps on the dog
you can watch
on the top we get 2 speakers that are separate from each other so that you can hear a real stereo separation but the sound quality is ok only similar price competitors like the iPad 7 or Samsung Galaxy Tab s 6 slide
even though it's not cheap at all it does feel super cheap on a positive note it shot using the USBC cable and just like with Samsung's and Microsoft's friends
APIs Google keep but in the settings you can exchange it with as many apps on the Play Store among those are bamboo paper and squid but Microsoft's OneNote is not supported using the HP USI
Chromebook or draw something that works fine but not as good as I'm used to from the Apple iPad 7 with zebra pencil the Samsung Galaxy Tab s 6 light with the s-pen or Microsoft Surface go to was the surface pen with the competition
when using web apps only the 64 gigabytes are fine of course but if you want to install the top gain store videos and photos it makes sense to get 128 gigabyte because usually it costs just a bit more and remember
the performance is excellent
that's the case regarding
maybe something needs to be better optimized here but if you really want to edit videos with the tablet your waivered off with an iPad anyways we do at Chromebook gets decent results in my gaming test
I wasn't able to install fortnight but Call of Duty and puppy mobile can be played with graphics that too high and I was able to play them smoothly but sure a better performance is possible
you get a much better experience with knife that which is faster and thus better speakers but if you want to game a bit in between it's possible when watching HD videos on YouTube at maximum brightness the battery lasts 4.5 hours if you're watching an HD video locally at 50% brightness it can last up to 10 hours so how good is the lenovo do at chromebook during my time with the tablet
it's just $279
I can recommend the duet Chromebook if you want to have a desktop class browser and want to get updates for a long time and if you don't have a keyboard in fact it is the cheapest tablet with keyboard that I can comfortably recommend
i'm moving pretty much
Xavier calm
we have the charging cable micro USB Quick Start Guide an instruction manual and the beautiful sound of plastic coming off glass so power and volume on the right side
USB charging port and a very flimsy cover which hopefully won't break where you have expansion for microSD rear megapixel five rear speaker front camera vanilla Android so very easy to set up you just press
Start once it boots up connect to your Wi-Fi it'll check for updates you can copy from an Android phone from the cloud or from an Android phone sign into Google
so it gives them more of a yellowish hue and of course the tablets also great for watching YouTube videos so with those punchy colors it looks excellent so thank you a matrix pad SC so the rate for you
it's very late
I don't like buying phones especially where it has extra carrier apps extra apps that just take up space this one just has the Google Apps which is great and you can add whatever you like from the Google Play
Store it still
it doesn't support that
it's not gonna blow your socks up for power so if you're looking for something for heavy gaming to replace your laptop this isn't it but web browsing you reading
YouTube very late duties it's gonna perform just slide so I think it's a good value so if you think it's right for you there'll be a link here we're even going to bank you and buy it from them we're also
thanks for watching guys
hello i'm here
i haven't done one of these in a while so uh i thought i'd do one again so i'm just gonna like show the unboxing of it and then the setup and then we're gonna do some drawing with it see how it works so this is what's inside the box
we'll go through
they've included different types
no it's not yet is that's one i use um and i think this one's like the american one or something um and then this is the actual uh wall socket you can you can put it on
um plug in it
it's very simple
little cylindrical box
so that's nice
no batteries
no charging or anything
i've used it a few times by now and it's like it's decent nice rubber um kind of rubbery grip thingy and here is the instructions and the smiley face to greet you
um there's the warranty policy in there um in the warranty policy it says you have like one year of um warranty if you get it from the xp pen website which is nice
it's like the hdmi
which plug goes where
there's like the hdmi the red usb which connects to power source this one goes into the tablet itself and the black usb goes into the computer you can see it's got a label on it for dummies like me
so now we'll move on to the actual tablet itself and take out this plastic wrap now this warning label on there tells you to very carefully pull off that tag at the top because what you want to do is remove the glossy protector and leave the map protector on there now
i'm an idiot
this is the stand
it's an extremely shallow stand so if you're like me and you like to draw more vertically like this just use your nice warrior books to prop it up just like i did very professional nice job proud of you boys so now we'll have a little look at the cables
uh this red one connects into your power source whether that's your mains your plug or your uh this adapter that plugs into your pc so you can actually power the tablet solely from your pc and then this last one plugs into the tablet itself in the upper left corner
okay so once you're all set up you're going to want to install your driver neck so go on over to the xp pen website and find innovator 16 and then click the driver tab right at the top
that's applicable to you
just check the little box at the bottom and go ahead and install that once you've installed it you'll get this handy dandy little guide that will help you set it up and you also get this program called pen tablet that allows you to change the express keys and the the pen settings and all that kind of stuff you may want to open the pen tablet program with run as administrator because mine didn't open otherwise so if you have the same problem that might fix it for you one thing you might want to do though is set one of your express keys to change
unfortunately only does it one monitor at times so if you want to switch windows from one monitor to the other you just have to switch it like that which is yeah could be better so now on to actually using the tablet
it doesn't quite respond at the beginning there but after that i worked fine that would catch me out a couple of times but honestly it was just the slightest little thing sometimes
um i also picked up that if you sort of angle the pen awkwardly your um your pen tip can be a little bit off as you can see here but didn't stop me too much now here
and it still works perfectly fine just like that like it's not plugged into the mains or anything and i thought that was really cool that you could just take anywhere and use it if anything the brightness changes but that's not really a huge deal still worked well which i think is a really cool feature um some people have asked me like with previous tablets
i need to plug it into the wall as well or can i just plug it into the laptop and a lot of cases you do have to plug into the wall but this one
and it's um super slim design makes it so that it's more portable as well so if that's a if that's a huge deal for you then this might be worth looking into
so this is a tablet designed to be taken with you even though it's a little big for that um it's still much easier than previous tablets now the negatives uh the customization of the express keys
i mean the choices
um when you want to use both of your monitors because this being a compute monitor tablet you're going to have two monitors using this um you can switch it to so that the pen uses one monitor at a time and with most tablets it has it so that you're using both monitors at a time like your pen spans across both monitors and i wish that was an option
there might be a hidden option for that somewhere but i couldn't find it so that's just a little nitpick um also the the buttons on the pen they weren't too customizable they're customizable enough to my taste
but sometimes i'd use my pen to like scroll you can hold on the bottoms and scroll um and i couldn't find an option for that but again that's just a little nitpick i also found whilst drawing it would occasionally stop working um every now and then i'd be drawing and then suddenly nothing would come out the pen and it would kind of lines would snap to and fro between each other and it was kind of weird
and they're easy to break and the the companions don't charge properly and they you know the batteries kind of swell so considering that i think this is totally fine
so i'm gonna be using it for that and then i'll probably update you guys on how it's been because so far i've only really used it on toon boom in photoshop
i don't know that so that might be something you'll have to look into because i don't use critter or fire alpaca or anything so you'll have to make sure it's compatible with those things
yeah that's it um
usually i go back to my cintiq since i spent a lot of money on it but this one's slightly bigger and it's working totally chill so i think i'm gonna stick with this one for a little bit and i'll update up there
see you later you
I've got two of them because I'm going to put one in each of the shops that I've got so that I can download apps and make older and easier for the staff but I'm going to do is I'll talk through what you're getting the Box the specifications of them and then we'll see them in operation so first things first obviously two boxes but what you get in
you get a stylus
you'd put a nano
and then pop it inside and this one is for just the Micro SIM so we'll go through that as well and you also get supplied a screen protector right
so a three-pin plug charger so you can charge through a USB or you can charge through a three-pin plug and again there's your micro USB and that plugs into the the specifications on it
10.1 inch screen is
it's a plastic screen
we're just going to leave this on for the time being until I finished doing all the apps and everything so this is just the thing that protects it in the packaging but turn it over and we take this off so here you can see we've got this slot for a micro SD card to expand the memory on it and then you've got two slots there for SIM cards if you want to use it for data as opposed to wireless
obviously plastic round
I'm doing this is I've actually had one of these before and already tried out so I know that it's er it's going to fit the purpose and the main thing is at 60 pounds it can get thrown around in the shops and it doesn't really matter if it gets damaged to a certain extent
just turn it on
version it's not 4G neither it's only a 3G so you need to be aware of that but again these things you tend to run them in a house or somewhere were just turn the volume down the puts on one side there
I'm going to set it up and a few apps onto it and then we'll come back the first thing is setting up the Wi-Fi you simply click on that pop your password in anyway
Start screen and that's with no additional apps on at the moment and obviously are going to the Play Store to download any of those prior to doing any of that
when you initially set it off is create a gmail account so that you can go into the App Store and download anything so I'm going to put YouTube on
it always useful
see what's going on
there's a secondary way of setting up your Wi-Fi etc and if you go into so this is the other tablet them setting up if you go into your settings there you've got various things like switching your Bluetooth on auto rotate using the flashlight on the back
Wi-Fi click on there
and you just go through the same process again of putting the password it botha now set up and I'll take you through the apps that I've got on there so for the shops what I'll be doing is I'll just be using the web interface for the the various things that the staff needs to use
I'm presuming it's about a 5 megapixel camera on it but you can see it there anywhere so nice little flowers that I took a picture off and if we come out of that you've got all your settings these are the preloaded apps so you can
I've just used just checking the tab off that originally came with it so when that scratches then I'll probably put the the new screen protector on and I would
they hold the charge
what's up guys
so with that being said let's begin and also don't forget to hit that like button and subscribe to the channel to see more reviews all right so let's begin so the tablet it's on paper record the charging break and that's pretty much it so it comes to the snapdragon 212 quad core at 1.30 gigahertz
it comes with the SD card reader in here so you can like expense storage if you want to also as I mentioned before it has a 2 megapixel camera in the front and another 5 min fixer and the back
it can tell it
it's what you expect
you can feel that it's not smooth so it lags a little bit while you're browsing even like for basic stuff so let's go ahead and open an app as you guys can see
but after a while that it launches it you can use it just fine also notice that sometimes even for Spotify it just crashes the app I don't know why so if you're really not a patient person anyone things to go fast
and sometimes it just like clicks on something we thought you thought you want some too so it also kind of stutters when I'm swiping up and down so I really thought that for basic stuff like that it would be like a better experience but I don't know why it's lacking on even like on simple tasks like that so I downloaded asphalt 8 for to see how it performs with high-end games so let's try it out so overall it quite surprises me because I wasn't expecting its rendus and it was moogly but it's actually really good really good
it looks great
so you can get
it's not the best quality but it's not a bad quality either so it's just an in-between you're gonna get a pretty good experience but it's not like foolish details still really expect much on this for me so design wise something that
I don't really like the position of the buttons on the side because as I said before people usually use telus on the portrait mode so it's hard to reach the volume buttons and it can get confusing
so that's something that really upsets me because it's not proportionate so you know it's just like something that exam wise it's not it's not gonna have the best design as you can see so
it's nothing too impressive
this tablet is first
so if you're using it to watch videos movies and listen to music it's not gonna let you know so moving on to the negatives what I dislike about this tablet is that I was expecting you to watch the apps a little faster and also it lags a lot so you have to be really patient while you're waiting for apps to launch and sometimes it just crashes out of nowhere so that's something to keep in mind when you're buying this tablet also the design in the front
I just don't like the camera position as I mentioned before and the bezels so I would recommend this talent to kids and maybe older people so they don't really have a heavy use so it's not going to be they're not gonna have they're not gonna have a hard time trying to use this tablet so
I think that the audience would be as I mention kids and older people so in conclusion I would recommend this tablet for people who expect a higher performance and also I think that there are better dealers out there if you look for example on eBay you can find with furbished iPads that are still supported by Apple for a couple of more bucks so you really really short budget and you don't expect much on performance
hit that like button
display means you're knockin
no matter where you look at this ever be the edge or the top or the bottom is gonna be very little if any color or viewing the loss at any angle
and that's what
I've noticed
I have it all the way as bright as you can get but even when you put it about half way it pretty much keeps its brightness so I definitely am impressed with that a lot of time you get these tablets and the brightness just isn't there this actually stays fairly bright inside this is a 64 gig storage amount
Wi-Fi it does 2.4
Bluetooth and GPS built into this it does have Google Apps as you can see so if you want to download any app that's in the Google Play Store you can
you can see the camera at the top there and then you get volume down volume up and also the power button at the top there on the edge right here of the tablet
if you're wondering you get a power brick you get power adapters for USA and Europe and then you also get a micro USB and also a power cord but wait wait
the sound is awful on this tablet other than that everything else works pretty damn well so let me load up a video alright so I have my video up right here
sound is like
I said absolutely horrendous
pretty good on this
let's push this video
that's at 360
let's put it that
looks like the highest
load up quick
actually this is
I'm doing this but it does do it fairly well even though I'm searching and stuff the processor inside if you're curious is an MT k-8 163 it's a quad-core processor
you just want to play some simple games and this should be able to handle that all right so let's hit run here with Ryan's world game and it does it pretty well like I say you get
I'm gonna die
oh my gosh
how about Elon
I've have that open and I want to take a screenshot takes a screenshot and all that stuff and then just to jump into settings here a little bit you can see with settings this I I looked around here
you'll see it's gone if you don't want it that wait you know not there or whatever display size you can come in here remember you can hook this up to your TV because it has HDMI so feel like a movie plan on here or something you could totally do that and it would play on your TV and it runs Android 9 so it's not the latest Android but even you know I installed a few apps and it still has a ton of storage left you can see I'm using ten gigabytes of 64 so you can definitely get a bunch of games and apps on this tablet and you know so basically the sounds not good at all you'll definitely want to use you can use it but you'll probably want to use Bluetooth speaker a bluetooth headphone or just a regular traditional plug in headphone a plug in speaker the screen is not bad at all seven 720p plus the angles are good the colors are good the brightness is good it's great for you know we're gonna watch movies or videos it's good if you're gonna play some light gaming you can obviously do
you could take photos
I didn't uninstall any apps if you're worried about like there being a lot of bloatware on here there's not there's not at all just the google apps are on here and and then the games
let me just show you the case real quick you can see it's full coverage for this case really cool with the ability to stand up when needed so pretty cool that you get all this protection and all this use for such a good price case accessories everything so if you want to pick it up it's linked down below
lay down for 129 bucks 139 if you get the one with the the keyboard if you want the keyboard and then the kids one is to be double check on that
so link down below
all right so
so let's try
iOS 13
this is weird
does this say anything
I don't mind it
it's totally ok
it's fine yes
just barely sad
i don't know it's it's decent if it that's all i wanted right to be able to move this from a table to another and have this just be stored again
if you look at it straight straight on it's kind of whitish it remains to be seen how it will look outside but but yeah see a huge surface right
this is amazingly large
it's pressure sensitive
so you can technically use anything which is good and bad right so if you lose this pen you're not gonna have to spend like fifty dollars on another one on another one of those
Wacom things you could just use your nails right or even finger and it's like insanely analog right so if you want just give it a tinge like a bit of color all right it does require some crashing right but yeah easiest to do
so that's that's nice
there's no locally raised
I would easily pay twice as much for this right so I hate like half like I don't hate it but like I do have some kind of OCD eye things alright if you make a mistake right like I did here
there's absolutely no way
OCD isn't as bad
it isn't evolved
it bothers me mildly
let's see I've just gotten this and I will not have time in the following days to either use it or review it so this is why I want to get this out right now so I don't know how exactly I'll get along with this how much I'll use it but I just want to get a video of it out because yeah absolutely no one talks about this and it pissed me off right before I bought it I really would have enjoyed seeing it in action and actually getting a feel for the scale
so yeah this is an a4 and as you can see let's Center it on the top left so it's kind of like this much on the left side and this much on the bottom right side
it's pretty good
you can see that
what else
how are you supposed to get this out all right very nice so this is a pretty cute cute little mechanism so we got the sell out and let's see if it still works and it still does right so this is complete
this might have capacitors but I do suspect that the writing on this is completely 100 passive if anyone has a video explaining like knows about a video explaining how this works
I would really not mine to see it so I will be looking for one briefly and yeah so basically the only active part of this is the actual raising which we need the cr2025 for and so let's plug this back in and you raise it boom and that is pretty quick and again it's it's
it's it's fully analog
you could do very nice stuff like look at this line right how it stops right so you could have like daily menus or some stuff on it but like
this is have it around the house and just make like grocery lists or like - dues or stuff because I don't know I don't know right and this is yeah I mean I don't know I don't know I don't know if I'll use this what I do have though and I do want to show because I did actually buy this order this in order to maybe avoid buying a remarkable tablet and the seller ship - too late and I bought the remarkable
I'm sorry so
what is this like
this is 400 euros
it has some some
Wacom style surface pink
I'll say it right off the bat so I paid 400 for this new at 600 but they very often drop the price down to 5 so I paid pretty similar to that which is quite yeah
I love the UI on this so I won't go into too much detail on this but I love the way the UI is is laid out like the design
the ink is fine
I don't expect this to be fast but the UI right so everything that is not related to actually that is not related to pen input right so this is super quick and the the feel on this right so these tips wear out so they feel insanely well alright so they do feel a bit better than this
this is more pressure since they have been thicker this is slimmer and this is the slimmest you can zoom in but it's a pain in the ass so right you can zoom in and it does vectorize stuff right so you saw it clear out and so you can get get in and do finer details
I think this would be the you know this would be the finest so if you want to have precision where you put the stuff then you can use the zoom but to get more resolution
I think the screen supports it but they just haven't implemented it yet and there's there's weird emissions for example if you zoom in right if you zoom into this deal
that is a bummer
UI runs super fast
I am extremely fussy about this kind of stuff and I've I'm fine with it so it's it's definitely not a tragic right absolutely all the notes get uploaded to your remarkable account and you can access them on apps on iOS Android and Windows
keyboard is super nice if for example if you want to change the name of stuff so there's limitations like not being able to move something from one page to another so for example
that's that's a bummer
it's a nice tablet
it is incredibly well
you just pop off the back so it's pretty easy to service and everything is DIY if so it has a battery that you can for sure get on Aliexpress in eBay
well not super clicky
I think mine is running down the battery a bit too fast so technically you should get like a couple of days and I'm leaking battery quite a lot and they've been extremely helpful and knowledgeable so thumbs up to the support unremarkable
yep the case so if you do end up buying the remarkable this this case is absolutely indispensable so it's this gray felt type deal with leather on the inside
I dropped a PCB on it and I do have an incredibly small scratch so I'm appreciating now gonna be able to see this on camera so scratches right here let me see if I can get the angle rights over here if the flickering would stopped and that would be awesome but again so I do have a fine scratch and yes so
that's basically pretty heartbreaking and so you would need a case to carry it around in any case like you do in any scenario like there's absolutely no way you can have this rub against absolutely anything except the top of the pen right
I mean they are for writing stuff and they do have electricity flowing at some point but yeah now they're really not at all comparable and I did write my name on this
all wrapped
the first thing that will strike you about it is how incredibly thin it is it measures in at a very slim 6.1 millimeters and is pretty lightweight making it an absolute pleasure to hold
it is entirely made of plastic but it definitely does not feel cheap and the back is coated in a textured matte finish at least on the white version that gives the tablet plenty of grip the rectangular shape silver trim and somewhat angular design is very true to Sony and depending on who you are you may love the simplicity of Sony's design or you may find it to be a little bit bland the bezels on the front may also not be the most aesthetically pleasing thing to look at functionally they make for great resting points for your thumbs but it does make the tablet look a lot like a picture frame
when staring at it head-on when holding the device and landscape you'll find both the power and volume buttons on the left side which makes complete sense on a tablet that's primarily designed for landscape use especially from an ergonomic standpoint as they're very easy to reach it's almost shocking more tablet
that you can take advantage of on the LTE enabled version on the front is pretty standard stuff with the usual sensors a front-facing camera and a multicolored LED notification light but most importantly there are dual front-facing speakers denoted by tiny slits
the screen measures in at 10.1 inches with a resolution of 2560 by 1600 making it extremely sharp and it provides pretty much everything you would want out of a large beautiful super high res display
and it's perfect for pretty much anything whether it's web browsing reading news stories keeping up with social networks gaming or even the occasional movie being that this is a Sony device you can also take advantage of Sony's x-reality engine for clearer sharper and more natural images or switch to a super vivid mode that really ups the saturation for a more vibrant image with photos and video
you can also get more granular with the display and make white balance adjustments in these settings if you prefer a much cooler or warmer color tone but by default the screen is already quite accurate in white balance and color temperature performance on the z4 tablet has also been extremely impressive
thanks to the powerful
Snapdragon 810 processor inside backed by three gigs of RAM the overall experience has been super fluid and I've rarely encountered any instances of lag or stutters if any to be honest and switching between applications multitasking and navigating through the general interface has been fantastic and gaming on the z4
obviously a lot of you guys will wonder if the z4 tablet overheats due to the Snapdragon 810 processor inside which has been notorious for running hot but so far
I primarily use my tablets for gaming and watching videos tasks I can typically generate a lot of heat with the processor a z4 tablet has done a surprisingly great job at keeping its cool
that is capable of reducing exterior noise by up to 98% when paired with a pair of digital noise cancelling headphones the z4 tablet can also optimize audio specifically for your ears no matter what pair of headphones or earbuds you use and I'm not an audiophile
even at max volume there are easily some of the best speakers you can find on a tablet right now although that statement probably doesn't do the z4 tablet justice
this is fresh water
but even so the z4 tablet consistently manages to eke out five and a half to six hours of screen on time with anywhere between 24 to 30 hours off the charger with lighter
more casual use
you can expect a drastic increase in these numbers and the z4 tablet should be able easily go for a good several days before needing to be plugged in cameras
but what you do get is an 8 megapixel camera on the rear and a 5 megapixel camera on the front for selfies and video chats the camera software is typical
but in any other conditions like low-light there's a noticeable level of noise and not having a flash certainly doesn't help the appropriate amount of color and detail that makes for a good image just isn't there and the camera tends to over sharpen the images to make up for it in software the z4 tablet is running on 5.0 point to lollipop with
after err but it keeps much of the material design elements of lollipop intact and mostly just stays out of the way many of Sony's familiar features are still here like these small apps for easier multitasking
this feature typically isn't quite as useful on a phone but it works a lot better on the z4 tablet and it's much easier to use due to the larger screen real estate
but also your general overall lifestyle to see how much time you've dedicated to doing certain things such as sleeping or listening to music throughout your daily routine like many other
and it's something that for the time being is very unique to Sony and gives the z4 tablet a huge edge over other tablets in the gaming department availability and pricing for the z4 tablet has yet to be announced for the US but it is available direct from Amazon for a starting price of $5.99 for Wi-Fi only $6.99 for the LTE version
and it's going to be purely up to you decide if it's worth it but as the old saying goes you get what you pay for and in this case
Android tablet well
it simply ticks off all the important boxes with a large beautiful display thin and light design fast performance excellent software great battery life and exceeds expectations by providing water and dust proof capabilities high res audio and Playstation integration
there's no such thing as a perfect product but there's not much bad you can say about the z4 tablet like I said before it's been a while since we've seen a great Android tablet at the market and the z4 tablet is a tablet that truly goes above and beyond

there was one big problem that I ran into when I was using this and it only happen in Photoshop specifically Photoshop on the Mac when brush smoothing is turned on
I get some really bad blobbing happening at the beginning of lines if I turn off brush smoothing lines are fine but if that's something that you use a lot in Photoshop just a heads up this doesn't work properly
Studio Medi bang
they're just on the
what's not included inside is a USBC cable being able to connect this tablet with just one cable that USBC cable is one of the new features that comes with this display
what does come in
one end connects to the display and the other end has an HDMI and two USB ports one of those ports is for transferring data and the red one is providing a little bit of extra power to run the tablet
you can order that
but here's my problem
no it's here so
I was really disappointed
and jeez it's $40
it doesn't open it
my best paint
whoo yawn themselves
it's fairly new
it's fully operational here
goes full screen
Android features is going to run into the same exact problems that I ran into whether getting the wrong kind of USB cable or getting one that's the right kind but just doesn't fit into their device the easiest workaround for this would be for Huyen to go ahead and just package in that cable with every device that they sell going forward
that's gonna solve all the problems but of course as you've seen these cables that can transfer this kind of data tend to cost a lot more than just a cheapo
I just can't guarantee you're ever gonna get those things to work if you are interested in how the Android features work go ahead and check out my Wacom one review and I posted a couple weeks ago and has features
yes there are some small plastic bezels around the screen and on the top and bottom but most of it is metal it is quite light with a weight of 236 grams and it is 8.25 millimeters thick again
we're getting a micro
the speaker sounds flat
that's what I can say about both 2 megapixel cameras - yes they work and if you're looking for super cheap skype device it's acceptable for that but with that being said photos and videos don't look sharp at all
they're blurry the lenovo tab m7 has a 7 inch screen with an aspect ratio of 16 by 10 even though the resolution is quite low was 1024 by 600 pixels
I like that
gigabyte internal storage
image works fine too and sure apps like the Kindle reader one great and youtubers usable its UI is not always super smooth but I've been able to watch videos with it comfortably
I played Birdland role and at the night and both want great other games like fortnight are not supported though on the lenovo tab m7 once android 9 go edition
the goal edition is a less demanding version of Android that does not require s powerful hardware it still Android and if you used n word already you will feel right at home however compared to normal Android there are some missing features
that means you can't open web site by site but the performance would be too weak for that anyways there are several changes like these and instead of normal google apps there are some go versions of those apps pre-installed among those is jima go
lenovo did not customized
we're getting pretty much
I like the software
and what go
Lenovo type m7 review
this is one of the few options to get and it can be a decent choice if you need it for simpler tasks only for surfing the web and reading emails or for watching
YouTube for instance
life are great at this price too both cameras and the speaker bed but that's to be expected it's major downside is the slow processor entervan gigabyte ram version for about 10 to 20 dollars
you can install it yourself though if you're willing to spend a bit more you should check out the Amazon fire HD 8 while its plastic body feels much cheaper too if the formants is much better it also offers a decent HD screen and a longer battery life again you've got to install the Google Play Store yourself though the next best tablet with Google's Android as you lean over tap m8 and Samsung Galaxy Tab
I'm reviewing pretty much
thanks for watching
this is an 8 inch tablet that has been around for a while but this is a new iteration that adds some new features but surprisingly doesn't add anything new inside of it so this is really the same tablet from a performance standpoint that Amazon has been offering since 2016
nobody is paying for this review nor has anyone reviewed or approved what you're about to see before it was uploaded so let's get into it now and see what this tablet is all about
so let's take a closer look now at the hardware this runs at about $79 as you see it but there's a catch for that low price and that is advertising you have to put up with ads on the lockscreen
as last year's tablet with one exception a new camera on the front it is now 2 megapixels versus a lower resolution camera that was on there last year but otherwise it is the same hardware
there's also a version that offers 32 gigabytes of internal storage so the hardware is really the same if you use last year's tablet the display is the same as well it is a nice display though at least for the price 1280 by 800 it's IPs
you've got really nice
viewing angles on it
and there's no anti fingerprint coating on it like you might see on more expensive devices so it's going to pick up fingerprints and grease very very easily so keep up walk around for it
it will very quickly pick up a lot of that grease from your fingers there so just be ready for that so while the hardware is pretty much the same
as last year's version they did make a pretty significant update to the software inside of this and they've added now the ability to issue voice commands to the tablet much like you would with one of their echo devices using the a-word so for example
Amazon tell me the weather in New York City so you can see here that it's in always listening mode and it just turned itself on when it heard the trigger word and was able to execute a command
you're familiar with so you can integrate it right into the rest of your home there and you also get visual feedback from it too and we'll be looking at one other neat feature related to in-home use with the voice commands that you might find interesting so that's probably the biggest change here on their low ends
this is running fire
but it doesn't run stuff from the Google Play Store and I always like to remind people about this because if you buy this tablet even though it's running Android you can't just go and install all the apps that you had on your Google Play account
so if you have apps purchased on another platform you'll likely have to buy them again on this one and the tablet weighs twelve point eight ounces or 363 grams so not all that heavy
you can even hold it with one hand if your hand is moderately sized so if you're looking for something with a larger screen that you can hold with a single hand comfortably this might do it for you
you've got stereos speakers here on this side for watching media so if you're watching stuff you might want to have those speakers pointed downward there on the other side here you've got the built-in SD card slot and another little improvement on this one versus last year's version is that you can put in larger from a capacity standpoint
SD cards on here
this connector is used for charging but it also works as an on-the-go USB port so you could conceivably plug in a game controller or something into that port it also has bluetooth support too
so just be careful
this will support headsets
battery life on this
if you're doing web browsing and some other minor kinds of stuff if you're doing something more aggressive like game playing and that sort of thing that will certainly tax the processor more and obviously reduce battery life but I think for media watching and web browsing 8 to 10 hours is not unreasonable from a battery life standpoint
it's not too bad when you're on a site it doesn't have a lot of JavaScript running so for example nasa.gov which doesn't have all the advertising for example that a new site might have does seem to load up pretty quickly here
there are a few sites that are beginning to tax this aging processor a bit namely new sites that load in a of advertising it might have a lot of JavaScript running in the background
is this fake app
which is what
so keep that in mind there is no a version of Netflix and many other popular streaming apps on Amazon devices but youtube is the holdout due to this feud they're having with Google which probably will never end so just bear that in mind one thing that does run very nicely of course are Amazon's own video services so we've got for example here an Amazon video
so if you got a kid that's really into Minecraft and you don't want to spend a lot of money for him or her to play it on the road
just fine here
Amazon used to have a lot more free stuff than they do now on their App Store for Prime members they had something called underground and there was a bunch of stuff that was usually something you'd have to pay for on the Google Play Store for example that was free on Amazon but they are phasing that program out so a lot of that free stuff is no longer there which I think diminishes the value a little bit of these tablets and on the 3dmark gaming benchmark test called slingshot
we got a score of 239 which puts it exactly where the 2016 version of this tablet scored on that same test because it has the same hardware built-in so there you go
not much has changed on the hardware front but there are some software improvements and speaking of there's one last thing to take a look at here and that is show mode
the regular fire
OS interface has disappeared
is that initially when the video starts up or when you pull the interface up it gets very dim like this so there are some kinks that they have to work out on it but largely it is working like an echo show
that will actually let this device work as a show when it's docked and then will automatically revert back to being a tab when you take it out of the dock so you have that option or you can just ask it to switch in and out of this mode so I can say to it now Amazon
I think it's a pretty good value especially if you don't want to spend as much on an iPad and I can tell you in my personal experience that these things believe it or not even though they're not built as well as an iPad are actually more durable
I have two children
it's caked with yogurt
and who knows what
but it's still actually working just as good as it was when we got it and the screen hasn't cracked yet yet the iPad inside an Otterbox case is smashed to bits and I think it's a lot less risky to buy one of these for a kid or for a teenager or whatever then a more expensive iPad especially given what these kids put these devices through
that if you need something that is more in line with a higher-end tablet go for the 10-inch device because it does have a faster processor that performs better than what you might see out of this 8-inch tablet or the smaller 7-inch one but nonetheless if you're looking for a usable tablet that can get at most of your media except YouTube
Simon thanks for watching
I do a lot of reviews on android tablets but I've never picked up a Chrome OS tablet mainly because I haven't found one that piques my interest until now with the Lenovo Chromebook duet
it was the only one that I could find online and personally I would recommend this one because we now have the Android ecosystem built into these Chromebooks and you're gonna want that extra storage so the first thing I noticed is straight out of the box is the build quality this thing looks like a premium tablet
I've done a lot of reviews on premium and low-end tablets and lenovo has been shining through with their tablets lately at least in the build quality department so along with the 10.1 inch duet tablet
and we'll get to those in a second but first up we get a wall charger our USB type-c charging and sync cable and we also get a USB type-c to 3.5
millimeter audio
but they've also included a detachable kickstand and a detachable keyboard to make this a true Chromebook and when it's all put together it'll look something like this it has that fabric backing on it and personally I really like the way this feels and looks
inch tablet here key
you might already have something like this that you've been using so you'd be used to it right out of the box but for me it did take a little while to get used to other than that
it works great
it's got that metal back here and they've also thrown in and the ain´t megapixel camera on the rear it does have built-in dual stereo speakers and this is not on par with let's say the Galaxy Tab A six an audio quality or even the iPad pro but overall for a $300 tablet
you're gonna charge this up with the 10 watt adapter that's included with the tablet but it also supports video out so if you have a USB type-c to HDMI adapter you can mirror this on a big screen very easily moving over to the specs for the CPU at the immediate exhale opie 60t
this is an octa-core CPU for a 73 course at 2 gigahertz and for a 53 course at 2 gigahertz 90% of the time when we're talking about Chromebooks they use an x86 CPU via Intel or AMD but here they're utilizing an arm CPU to keep the cost down and power consumption down the GPU is the Mallee g72
mp3 at 800 megahertz
it's obviously running
we have that kickstand
it's magnetically attached
I mean you can hold this thing upside down and shake it so it's very secure and if you need to detach it and just lift it from here and it comes right off so with the duet running Chrome OS
we have tablet mode which makes it a lot easier to use just as a tablet and if we attach the keyboard it'll go to keyboard mode and basically this is what every other little Chromebook or Chrome laptop looks like and with everything attached here
Chromebook would the keyboard and the trackpad worked fine with the duet we do have gestures built-in for the trackpad and it's touchscreen so if you just want to navigate with your finger you can always do that also so here we are in strictly tablet mode and I got to say this screen looks absolutely amazing for being a $300 tablet or 280 if you go with the lower end model so along with Chrome OS we also have access to the Google Play Store so we can download Android apps now
we can also access
I was worried about it at first but you got to keep in mind that this is an arm CPU so if there's a certain Linux app that you need to run and it does not work on arm
CPUs and it actually works quite well on the duet so this is a full-fledged open-source image editor and a majority of the Linux apps that are going to run on this
I'd like to run some benchmarks and test out some games now if you're already accustomed to using a Chromebook for a work or school this is gonna fit right in
it is Chrome OS
we did get a pretty good jump in single core and multi-core performance so when it comes to a CPU intensive task the tab s6 light will beat out the lenovo do add so the test I just ran was Geekbench 5 this tests CPU performance but what about GPU performance as it turns out both of these tablets have the exact same GPU the Mallee g72 mp3 clocked to 800 megahertz the tests
sling shot extreme
I have Netflix
I'm sure this will be fixed down the road but right now if I want to resume a video it goes to a black screen I kind of have to drag it back a little bit and then it starts playing perfectly fine audio is working when the black screens up but unfortunately that video just isn't showing up when I try to resume one thing
I was actually really excited about in getting this tablet was testing out some native Android gaming on this unit since we have the Google Play Store and most apps will install and work fine on the duet
FPS but most of the time were around 50 to 60 at 10 chunks with fancy graphics off in my opinion Minecraft Pocket Edition is fully playable on the duet
next up we have
King of Fighters all-stars
I don't buy anything
I did have to turn it down to low to get a decent framerate and even then I notice a little bit of stuttering here and there and to tell you the truth
I do have the settings on medium but it's really not taking anything away from the game itself and by the way I am using touch controls with all of these games but if you want to connect the controller it'll work fine
I'm actually really impressed
the screen looks great
Android built in which a lot of the apps that I tested actually function really good but again I do have to mention if you're looking for strictly Android and you don't need Chrome for work or school
I do have a Chromebook that I mess around with every once in a while so if you're a Chrome OS user just let me know in the comments below what you would like to see running on this in the next video
I'd like to see how it stacks up to a comparable 300 dollar x86 Chromebook and I do have one that I can test against it so just let me know in the comments
thanks for watching
oh hey
15.6 pro by
it costs $500 u.s.
15.6 bro
it does the job but it's it's kind of limbs II and it's just one extra thing that you need to carry around and we have the little packet here with some of the manuals
I reviewed for which by the way you can find a link down in the description below but basically connected to the tablet is a single USBC port and then that connects to your computer through HDMI and USB and you have the option to use a secondary USB cable for power or you can connect that USB cable to the power adapter to plug it into the wall meeow basically this means that you can travel with this and use only your laptop to power the tablet which is pretty nice and then you have the pen itself which is slightly different but the difference is mostly visual
the artist series
just a cleaner slimmer look overall and that's going to be the main difference here just how thick it is and its overall footprint compared to the other tablet because the thickness here is just a little under one centimeter so it is very slim and for me you know
I would use something like this as a portable tablet something that I can bring you know when I travel and so I do appreciate the slimmer profile but other than those things you have the same amount of customisable keys
the only major difference is going to be in the quality of the colors and I say major but that's a joke the older XP pen model features a hundred and twenty percent srgb color gamut which is almost ninety percent of the Adobe gamut now this one instead of a hundred twenty percent srgb
and of course it is slimmer but it connects exactly the same way to the computer and yet in terms of the weight is going to be very very similar just by hand
I did make a quick test with the two tablets side-by-side and loading up some very colorful images to see if there was any significant no differences between the colors and I will say that the newer version the innovator 16 does look slightly richer in terms of colors
I've had the tablet for a little over a week now so I've been playing around with it quite a bit and I was very curious to see if my main piece of feedback from the last review had been addressed or not yet but yeah unfortunately everything is just just the same as the other tablet
I'm just color picking selecting different colors and but I'm going too quickly or if I don't press hard enough and it's as if nothing happened and I have to do it again
so that's a little bit annoying of course but it is very subtle just as subtle as it was on the previous tablet and this seems to be a feature of all the XP pen tablets that I've reviewed recently
I don't know but this is a big one that they should definitely fix definitely improve so I was slightly disappointed that you know the pen itself is no better than the previous one
the surface feels good
making sure that there's no you know dead pixels or dead spots on the screen and there were none of that made also did not get hotter even after you know many hours of working on it it gets a little warm around the area where you plug in the USB sea cable but it's definitely not hot overall
I was very pleased with it and one thing that I will say is after trying all these tablets and and you know spending some time with them that initial activation of the pen is starting to bother me less and less
I'm sure if this was your first tablet and you've never experienced like a Wacom or painting on an iPad and this would not be a problem at all for you the only downside the real downside to it for me at least as an artist would be that when you press very very gently to start like a line
that's very fine
you're gonna have a hard time getting what you want so you can start with a bigger stroke and then reduce the pressure to get a very fine line that it works that way the other way around not so much because of that initial activation sensitivity issue to be honest
I just yeah I just wish to fix it because when it comes to XP pen tablets those are really two of my main criticisms the fact that they still have a protective film over their glass because the glass is not good enough
of course it would be nice to have some better panels so the colors are better and the resolution is better but to be honest at this price points even if it's fifty dollars more than the other tablet it's still incredibly affordable and now let's take a look at my new tablets charts now that
I've reviewed a bunch to see where this one places compared to the other ones and of course more importantly if it's worth the money so here I have some very scientific charts and I'm gonna quickly explain so that this makes a little bit more sense first thing we have to understand with this
is that everything
in general and those three characteristics will be the affordability the quality of the tablet the quality of the tech and just the enjoyment of using the product the opposite of enjoyment would be things like significant like annoying flaws problems and the drivers and things that make just the overall experience less fun
I have this one
and for me the fact that it's a tablet without any hot keys without keyboards without any shortcuts really and also just a glass surface of the screen are all things that really really turned me off when it comes to drawing
now when those circles intersect though this is where the good stuff is so if it's only affordable and it's kind of cheap if it's a tablet that's great to use but it's not affordable and isn't really up to the standards of today when it comes to tech or to its technology then it fits in that circle if it's just a tech gadget so high quality but expensive and not as great to use
of course that's where we're going to find all the Cintiq pros the best tools you can get but they are definitely not affordable and then we have the main intersection and center and that is a great spot to be in so this is where it plays the artists 24
Pro that I reviewed last time I still placed it closer to the affordability circle a little bit further away from the enjoyment and tablet quality circle because because yes the tablet quality is pretty good
but it's definitely not as good as the Cintiq s-- and it would have been slightly more enjoyable if it didn't have the few issues that I mentioned during the review and finally in the center
the artist 15.6 bro
I'm going to have this one slightly closer to the enjoyment circle and a little bit further away from the affordability circle because it is more expensive and the fact that it looks and feels a little bit more premium
looks better to me
adds to the enjoyment
it's what
I consider the real
good stuff the innovator 16 I feel is a good tablet for the price it's portable too so that's an extra bonus now to be honest for tablet that's so similar yet more expensive
me personally yes
15.6 bro
they're both so similar
they weighed the same
and they're about the same size so you're really paying $50 extra for a cosmetic upgrade at 500 bucks though if you compare it to the Wacom Cintiq s-- it is a fantastic deal
so there you go
make your decision if you're shopping for one of these things now if you end up getting the innovator 16 which by the way just came out at the time of this video let me know how you like it
yeah that's that
I'll see you guys
Lenovo ThinkPad x1 tablet
this is a very nice device but I've been loved by Microsoft to have a play around with so this is lenovo's take on the chewing ones like the surface surface pro range like surface pro for something like that
you can see here
it's got the magnetic keyboard very much like the surface has so you've got to clip on up and it folds up just like the surface it's got a kickstand that goes from the top rather than from the bottom or so say goes from bottom rather than from the middle like the surface flavor and its ports pen as well right
you you want
I just had to pen out for now and I'll show you what that is gonna say we've got USB 3 USB C which is the Chargers USB C and DisplayPort as well so ok silence so I can't hear anything that on there
it's lovely in quiet
but as a tablet it works really well just as you'd expect or Windows tablet to work so very much it feels very much like a surface Pro range I have a surface pro 3 and it does feel very much like that
put that in in there when you're out and about you can use that and it can switch between Wi-Fi and the 3G 4G connectivity so you've got a lot of connectivity options with that I think that is one of the really nice things with this so it's a tablet
it's got a nice design then of course you've got the keyboard let me flick that in it clips up just like the surface pro does but that combination of the of this angle means that for one
it's it's actually quite a nice keyboard and you get key but travel is not too much it feels nice and so there's it bit of movement with it but I would say it's probably about as it's probably about the same as my surface pro 3 toes typing speed
Pat's a person
I prefer a trackpad
SSD drive on there
there's plenty performance it
you'd have no problems
I often use minecraft
it got dark
Minecraft I like to use my crafting example because it does push the machine to get hot so many other devices have been using and it's has to be live a lot one of the many things people ask me about and it's not easy to install from Windows Store as well
no problems at all
you can install
Excel files on there
Photoshop that kind of thing as well now as well as these input methods it also comes with an active pen and there's a couple of little different holders for the pen actually in this one now it showed you the start video actually plugged into the USB port lease unused
yes and let's quit this sorry tablet mode you can use it as a as a pointer navigating around windows of course you can actually use it to with the pen to actually draw ink as well
I did notice us they so you can see I can write on there and I need any supports 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity so gets a very fine taurine on there not that
and there's no razor
I think on here
there's no eraser with the pen although I've got two buttons and you can can configure those this is currently reading the standard version of Windows 10 when the anniversary edition comes out probably July this year 2016 there's gonna be something called Windows ink which is a new set of apps designed for the pen as a drawing option
clear screen
it's probably cannot really tell from YouTube video but though it's a really nice screen it's high-res so you can see a lot on the screen at once but I think you see sharpness that I rely on that
I've been finding well
this is showing 52% two hours 47 so it's about that five hour market really does depend on what you using with it running and what brightness level which you're running great at 60% there when you play minecraft something like that doing photo editing it drops down to about four hours something you really just depend on your load but I found the battery
life is better than my surface pro 3 about same as the surface pro 4 so pretty impressive for that to look at the price it is a higher end devices
this configuration is about 1,200 quid it comes with Windows 10 Pro as well the fortunately connectivity at some cost so that's why I say it's got a really nice screen
I believe there are other accessories available like a dock and keyboard USB ports that kind of thing that the basic device itself is limited to the single USB 3 port and you could pull the hop into that guess as well and the charger should say 245 what USB C adapter as
it's quite what they will say laughable and with the pen as well it's a good business device now you could give this to someone to use business it you know
so you can install Chrome iTunes it and you want and it's got the power around the performance through the SSD drive really to do a lot and to be your one and only device so is a proper two-in-one convertible or top so it's a proper two-in-one tablet and laptop is certainly
lifestyle come and it's a very nice device or I should mention as well whether this is because it's come from Microsoft but there's very little extra software installed on here that is an issue with some even from Lenovo and people like that so we've got the Wacom pen tools around there and we've got the 4G connectivity options and some lenovo updating software and that really is it so it makes it and nice clean experience as well I think the 4G connectivity is great as well being able to just not have to pair it all with your phone or anything which is what I would normally do to do data when I'm out and about so thanks watching this video more videos on our YouTube channel
that's both economical
we're gonna unbox it
let's go the van
QoS 20 tablet has it all the processor is designed with a quick response in mind it has an Android 9.0 operating system and an octa-core processor which is suitable for small and medium-sized games
GPS an option many other tablets at the same price don't have it comes with three gigabytes of RAM plus 32 gigabytes of storage not to mention a microSD slot for additional storage
the front camera is 5 megapixels and the rear camera is 8 megapixels it includes a six thousand milliamp hour battery with long endurance of about 10 hours of usage finally amazing built-in dual speakers with excellent sound quality
peel it off
you will find your power button up and down volume buttons and the headphone jack on the top but cover for the SD card slot and the power cord jack on the bottom the dual speakers
it will also copy apps and data from your other devices select which Google services you would like to use and it will finish up to let you have fun
that's nice let's see
goshen com bringing up
we go great resolution
let's see what we
who pretty flower hollows
i'll on pin adam
wow that's amazing
sweet 33 moves
are your directions having
Hey there it is
this tablet has is that you can turn a black and white so you can read it like a Kindle just bring down the top right menu and click on read mode it automatically changes the vibrant color display to a soothing black and white perfect just like reading off paper
then just scroll through the stations to find your favorite time to get away for a while even though it has really good dual speakers you can connect it to a Bluetooth headset
and it's an economical price if you want to buy one look in the description below and click on the link if you don't know us for a devotion a family of nine poles setting in Central Michigan
what is up guys
so join us
Huy on is that its product is more than 200 dollars cheaper which is quite significant especially for students or hobbyists looking for a decent sized drawing tablet despite its low price point
you ready for this
we got the tablet a pen with a cap charging cables instructions along with a drawing glove to keep that tablet pristine a carrying case extra pen nibs and a nib holder did
Hyun has a bit less resistance with its surface coating compared to walk-ons offering whether this is good or bad ultimately comes down to personal preference but I imagine that this will take some time to get used to if you're coming from a Wacom tablet aside from that all the shortcut buttons are well-constructed and feel firm when being pressed on the side of the tablet you can find a mini USB port that is used to connect the tablet to a computer we have 12 shortcut buttons which can be configured along the side and 16 expressed soft key buttons which are along the top you can activate the soft key buttons using the stylus
that's an amazing bonus for something that's just a sub $100 tablet all right now for the pin while we did say that the tablet construction is very good you can tell if the pin is where some compromises were made to keep the price down
Wacom you can tell that both of these pens are not made on equal footing the Wacom pen feels much more solid compared to humans which feels quite hollow and light having said that though with this 8192 pressure levels a plethora of shortcut buttons as well as including a pen holder with eat extra replacement nibs
but that shouldn't be an issue as long as it's charged between drawing sessions the grip is made out of a hard matte surface and while it's not uncomfortable to use
another thing
we should mention
or maybe some removable labels that we could physically put on the buttons itself after mapping them out of the box you have shortcuts for the brush tool brush sizes zooming in and out and undo
the good thing is that these functions can be reassigned depending on your preferences or if you don't use Photoshop if you are left-handed the orientation of the tablet can also be changed if needed the 16 soft keys located on the drawing surface of the tablet itself can also be bound to keyboard shortcuts or menus
we found that it was a bit hard to use these soft keys compared to the physical ones as we had to look down every single time to make sure we were hitting the right one but once you get used to it
we can see that there are pretty much options to customize both the tablet and me pinned together we also have an option to test out the pens pressure sensitivity when it comes to actually drying with the pen in the tablet we found
but it's very faint
I don't know if it even tells you if the battery needs to be charged there's also no light indicator on the tablet itself to show if it's connected to a computer another thing
I have three monitors hooked up and I can tell the software which monitor to specifically use or I can use all three at once hovering over the tablet will show your mouse indicator and it feels very smooth and accurate
today is whether or not someone should buy this tablet if they're looking to begin their creative endeavors or if they're already a very well seasoned artist and for both of these people
we're currently filming this off a Nikon d50 300 a beginner's camera when it comes to videography it's a great camera and it allows us to film quality videos which you are watching right now the who I on is comparative to this camera
Wacom has to offer
but it's into his pro n only you can decide if the small difference in build quality is worth the extra two to three hundred dollars but either way you get a really solid product

Tegra 3 1.4 gigahertz
what do you get for your money though you get an IPS display and this is impact resistant rugged glass they don't go out and say Gorilla Glass there so I don't know quite what it is
they do have more of a corporate focus generally speaking at Fujitsu so as an Nvidia tegra3 quad core CPU clocked at 1.4 gigahertz with one core running 1.3 gigahertz if multiple cores are running gig of ddr2 ram 32 gigs of flash storage is an EMC technology and we have a microSD card slot on board a micro USB port and a 30 pin proprietary dock connector that she'll use with the included charger and you can also use it with the optional $70 dock now $70 dock adds on USB port
HDMI out so ya know HDMI out on this tablet but take a look around a certainly a nice looking tablet very thin and it reminds me of the Motorola Xoom family in terms of sturdiness
it's where your micro
I believe that's a soft touch over metal nice and rigid eight megapixel camera with LED flash pretty high resolution camera for that sort of more business or I need to tell but and there are stereo speakers as with the little slit is here and then there's another one over here the tablet runs Android OS 4.0 a3 Ice Cream Sandwich
there are no customization
Android right down to the fact that you have just the usual stock Android bump screens here as boring as they are and you get one option for one that's a dark blue with a Fujitsu logo on it so I Wall Street guys are a little app shortcuts there and if we take a look at that drawer you can see hardly anything on there it must may these apps I've actually put on here are various benchmarking tools for example that's it for preload application
that's just the standard Google Android stuff so you do get your Gmail on here you get the YouTube player and all the usual Google goodies on here has maps it also has a built in GPS which works fine in our test dope and Wi-Fi 802 11 BGN bluetooth 3.0 of a + edr also if we take a look at the widgets
it did very well
it did 1869
that's pretty good
it's not one of the top ones but it's about par for the course again among Tegra 3 Android tablets and also for Qualcomm s4 devices and for GL benchmark 2.5 using the each of 2.1 classic test scored 52 FIPS and 35th off screen
wouldn't be my first choice beside to use as an e-reader for that reason movie playback and streaming videos certainly will look nice on the IPS display and you can play games on it and do everyday business things to using MS Office compatible office suites you name it comes with the standard
Android web browser
no chrome here yet
Android iOS 4.1
Android keyboard here
we've got our Kindle Fire HD review here and we'll check out our YouTube based video it's gonna play using html5 since Adobe Flash is not included dummy again drop support for mobile devices on August 15 that means Android and you can side load it if you want to go find out on a Dobies website and load it onto the tablet yourself
it sounds natural camera
here's our user interface
plenty of setting is available and you can simultaneously shoot video and take a photo at the same time and you can see we also have panorama mode down here as an option and if we want look at the settings for regular photos a couple of scenes to choose from what a white balance evie flash control that kind of thing and
notice the water
for example this is our little training section also notice the particles floating around four minutes is good for all the friends to show there and as we go through the water here one more cooler to work you see some waters falling down from the ceiling so as we stand there
it is sealed inside and Fujitsu claims up to eight a quarter hours of video playback on a charge and so far in our test that seems to be pretty close to accurate
it's it is kind of tough to recommend because there's so many other tablets on the market under $150 less you name it still nice piece of hardware very thin very line very sturdy nice rear camera on this and very very vanilla plain build and Android
now that's a fine thing if you're a power user and but otherwise for those of you who open this up and take it out of the box there's no PDF reader
there's no office suite
that kind of thing
hey everybody this is
Windows RT based tablet to hit our labs this is the Asus VEVO tab arty and is based on Windows 8 forearm essentially but branded Windows RT by Microsoft it's a 10.1 inch slate and it's driven by an Nvidia quad-core Tegra 3 chip at one point three gigahertz with onboard 12 core
here you're looking at the 32 gig version with its companion keyboard dock 32 gig versions retail for $5.99 64 gig versions of the VEVO tab RT with dock are $6.99 the dock has one USB 2 port and the tablet has one micro HDMI port
that's in the tablet as well as the dock 802 11 b/g/n Wireless and Bluetooth 4 o are onboard there is an 8 megapixel rear facing autofocus camera with LED flash in the back and a 2 megapixel front facing webcam screen size again 10.1 inch and the camera will capture 1080p resolution resolution for the screen is 1366 by 768
RT the operating system 3 and 4g LTE capabilities are optional on this device and this tablet actually is a Wi-Fi only model and the battery onboard is a 25 watt hour battery with a 22 watt hour battery in the dock
we've got the tablet mounted in its companion keyboard dock and incidentally this is the AC power adapter and sync and charge cable that come with the unit allows you to charge the tablet or the dock or both combined and also allows you to interface the tablet or both combined to your computer via USB this is a proprietary Asus connector on the other end here
if you would like to release the tablet from the dock just push down on the button here on the left side of the tablet and now you are released and full tablet mode is invoked here on the bottom
right there
two-in-one headphone jack
you've got a micro
door and a micro SD card slot right there and that release switch for the keyboard dock and on the back you've got that eight megapixel rear facing autofocus camera with flash LED flash and on the front you've got that 2 megapixel front-facing webcam and taking a quick look at the keyboard dock
if you have even average-sized hands but keycaps have good tactile response and fair amount of travel so not bad a little bit of a learning curve getting up to speed typing on this thing though ample size the touchpad area with 2 button control and multi gesture support you do have a Windows button and standard as well and a menu button over here that will help with additional functionality for Windows RT and Windows 8 on the right side here is a USB 2 port and that's really about it over
ACS logo comes up
we are going to get to the Windows Metro interface here in about 25 seconds which is pretty nimble now obviously Microsoft has taken a lot of heat for the radical departure of the Windows 8 Windows RT user interface versus previous generation
you will sort of be stymied at first if you don't know some just basic gestures and commands however once you do learn those very few you know half a dozen or so gestures you'll see just how efficient fast and fluid the operating system is so
Start screen capacitive
touch button
it's a little
Windows Start button
Start screen
charms toolbar over here
Start share which is for your social networks Facebook Twitter all that good stuff when you're in an app if you want to share out that screen or some content from the app as well as the search button which works the same way you can search the tablet or you can search via an application like for example Internet Explorer you can search via Bing so pretty standard but again
that's the charms
lets swipe through some apps that we have running in the background right now as you can see very fast very fluid we've got Internet Explorer going here we can swipe in the Pandora radio station app for Windows 8 Windows RT
this is the
Bing travel app and we're back in and explore now we can go ahead and share this foreground window with another app just by bringing it in here from the left stopping
get back to a full screen for internet explorer and if we want we swipe back to the left we can see all the apps we have actually running in the background over here and we can cycle through them this way as well for example
let's go ahead back to Internet Explorer and we can show you we just got through pulling up the Internet Explorer URL bar here just by swiping up from the bottom and you can go through tiles of pages that you have opened currently up top here touch
it also brings up your history right here and you can cycle through any of the sites you've been through in your history so pretty efficient stuff there as well again just with a few simple gestures in Internet Explorer now in Internet Explorer
and you don't see any screen redraw at all it just pops in which is pretty darn impressive and better than what we've seen for most Android slates and a lot more like we see from Apple's iPad series now in addition to the Nvidia tegra3 quad core ARM SOC and the 2gig of RAM on board
Windows 8 Windows
RT is so responsive is that Microsoft has developed a new method of handling applications whether they be in the background or in the foreground and putting applications to sleep rather than killing them or letting them run full bore all at once
and so
Bing news app we've got Pandora running and Internet Explorer running as well as the desktop and task manager and all the apps in office running right now all simultaneously and as you can see all of the apps are listed here in task manager
0% CPU 53% memory
currently let's click to the performance tab real quick and you can see currently the CPU is idling at under a gigahertz about 640 700 megahertz to be exact and only about 50% memory and that's because all of these applications are not technically running at once
State and so very efficient resource management memory management and CPU resource management with Windows 8 and Windows RT and of course equally as important to any tablet or smartphone device is the software ecosystem behind it and in addition to things like an email app the web browser or music player app or the standard utilities
RT device Microsoft's store is available and that is competitive to things like Google Play and Apple's iTunes and it is a fledgling effort we would right now currently with not a whole lot of titles available but Microsoft promises a deluge quote unquote of applications coming to the store
Asus picks Netflix games
Xbox controllers or USB Xbox controllers we were not able to get ours configured currently working properly through the USB connectivity of the device but we may be having our own issues there and it might not actually be a hardware problem
Hydro Thunder hurricane and I will go ahead and fire it up as you can see loading pretty quickly here and the graphics again driven by Nvidia's Tegra 3 quad-core processor with onboard 12 core NVIDIA GPU
go ahead and bust some things up for you here so you can see how it reacts is some water effects on the lens there the camera so some pretty good stuff and this is again
thanks for stopping by
sup folks today
you connect the tablet to a computer and draw on the tablet as if you were drawing on paper so one of the very first things that i noticed with
i normally use
at first i found it a little jarring to draw with all that space but essentially it became really adaptable and i was still able to adjust the drawing area that i could use
you can also adjust those to make a lot of useful shortcuts when you're drawing i'm not used to using shortcuts on my other tablet so i found it difficult to regularly use them when i drew but they do make the best clicking noises
I set the button on the bottom to undo and the one on the top to right click for things like color picking however the buttons on the top of the tablet
there are controls for volume playing and pausing and certain settings for switching windows as well as a slider to zoom in and zoom out now on to the accessories that came with the tablet
there's a super handy pen holder that if you twist the top off reveal spare pen nibs that you can replace of the nibs start to wear it down on the pen
so that's exactly what I did the falling will be a speedpaint while I used the tablet as I explained my experience with it the sensitivity was actually a little different than my Wacom tablet
space grey starry blue and coral or sunrise red and I did choose coral red because I'm a sucker for over-the-top saturated colors it's such a unique and fascinating color for a tablet and I'm so here for it
I will say I had a bit of trouble using express keys in shortcuts mostly because as I said before I don't use Express keys normally but by default there were really helpful
I'll point out was that the Express keys on the pen sometimes didn't work immediately or I wouldn't be able to press it too quickly or else it wouldn't work but it didn't drastically hinder the drawing process overall
greetings everyone Eric
we're gonna be looking at the a-15 graphics tablet from vyq so right off the bat vite was very gracious enough to send me this tablet to review however this is not sponsored so all the opinions are my own
there is no screen so you just draw on here and whatever you're moving when you're moving the pen on the surface of this it shows up on your screen so the mouse will move which is not a problem
they're very nice
this does nothing
I'm I actually did
the footage just
is this pen
I have a another tablet from XP pen which does have the rubber hanger like grip around the end which I really do like so I wish more companies would just make that a standard feature of all pen
cuz it's really handy the more things you get is you get the USB cable which is actually a USB type-a goes to your computer but the part that connects to the tablet is actually a ninety-degree type-c connector which is really nice more devices
it's really nice
it plugs in right here on this side next to the little color thing so it plugs in right there which is really easy it just kind of snaps in nice and snug so you can even have it that way or if you want mending on how your desk setup is going you can have it that way so very versatile really like that
Vikes oh I have so many of these bloody things because of like all these products that I've reviewed but they're nice Club they're basically if you've ever gotten a tablet from any of these companies
I guess it's protected but QuickStart guide shows you how to install the drivers and how to plug this thing in and then of course you get this little like thank-you thing here now
the important part is it tells you where to get the drivers from because there is no CD you got to go on to the website to get the drivers from installation was also really simple
install it which doesn't take that much time at all once you have it installed it'll show up in your little window tray you just right-click it go to show driver settings and this is where you're gonna find all your settings for the things like the pen
which is all the keys that you're gonna be setting which is all customizable and of course just the about us which is where you can check for updates and stuff like that also in the function keys
I'll freeze frame here up at the top you'll notice where it says all app you can actually set it so that depending on what over him you have open it'll change
what keyboard shortcuts
I did a video on Wednesday with my drawing with Eric series where I drew of the Black Panther and in that video which I'll link in the description I use this tablet to draw a black panther
in fact the draw
if you go watch the video the drawing came out fine except for the hands which that was just me not me being dirt with hands as always but the trolley came out really well
so it's really easy to just glide across the buttons are really tactile and you can really feel when you cook them but anyway definitely check out that video because that'll show you it in action in full and how
so you don't have to charge it or anything and it's also got the two buttons like it's just for 8 for 8 1:52 pressure sensitivity if that's something you're into because you're a painter or whatnot you can't beat it it's just this is really good bike
you can also get multiple colors you know the it comes in four color so that's great so yeah check the link in the description where you can pick it up
I highly recommend it or definitely will check out other reviews of it just to get multiple opinions especially if you find an opinion from someone who will use it the same way you do so just make sure that it is what you're gonna want but for me personally
I would love to hear your opinion on it or how you like it if you have any questions definitely you can ask me but I would suggest just going directly to vite themselves
hey everyone today
I'm going to review this wireless graphics tablet from Huyen the model number is Q 620 M also known as the inspiron before we take a closer look at this
this is the card we have the download link to or you can download the driver and that's the Quick Start Guide we have the Pens 10 and the pen
the pen stand allows you to put the pen horizontally as well as vertically you can twist open it to review 10 replacement nibs and that's the new remover in the center
balanced USB wireless receiver the tablet actually works with Android as well so this are the USB adapters that are provided so they can use the tablet with your Android phone or Android tablet we have USB c2 normal USB and this is micro USB to normal USB because the drawing tablet is wireless it needs to be powered by battery and this is the USB cable to charge that tablet the official retail price for this is us one hundred and nine dollars there may be discounts depending on where you buy and who you buy it from
I'm seeing here
I like the rounded corners controlling will and there's a button here in the middle this column of eight physical shortcut buttons rounded off at the top and bottom and there are light indicators in the middle but they are not lit up yet because this is not connected yet and round the corners for the drawing area now this is considered a medium sized drawing tablet
the finishing
they have firm feedback
you can customize right now it has been set to zoom in and out changing the brush size and scrolling you can customize the column of buttons as well you can input your own keyboard shortcuts
when you press the button you will have the cursor jump to another screen and jump back here you can switch brush depending on which have you use you may be able to switch to alternate brushes and here you can even use it to launch program
this is where you can customize the precious sensitivity of the pen you can control the pressure using this curve which is nice and the two side buttons can be customized as well to even keyboard shortcuts
Windows ink so if you have any problems with the pressure of the pen not working properly you may have to toggle this on and off there is mouse month
go to the right
sorry that's the battery
it's excellent no problems with dots and this is clip studio paint or Windows pressure works fantastic as well and this is very responsive clip studio usually works very well with tablets so it performs very well here which is not surprising the transition from thin to thick
works here as well
I don't usually use this app for drawing I just want to show you the pressure sensitivity and tilt with Krita there is very noticeable input lag and even when
I'm using a toothbrush
so let's have some vertical strokes where the darker ages are on the left and I'm going to change the direction of the pen to have the darker edges on the right side
so that's great
so that's quite smooth
I have with
you can also use the cable that's provided but if you use this well it's actually using their horizontal space and mapping that to the vertical format of the phone or tablet that you're using so obviously that's not going to work right if you are using the wireless receiver
I'm not sure why
it's not working
so it's a very troublesome a way to get a wireless receiver to work if it doesn't work the first time or if it gets disconnected halfway like what's happening right now again
I really like it
it's very beautiful
it has a very nice tactile feeling when drawing the buttons the towel they have very firm feedback and the build quality is just solid so in terms of look and feel
the tablet in terms of drawing performance is quite satisfactory at least with the Windows drawing software that I have tested now there is some lag with Krita and Photoshop
it's quite responsive and this pan is very sensitive so pressure and tilt sensitivity works really well and it's a very accurate pen when it comes to drawing thin and thick
and it's able to maintain consistent pressure when you are drawing so you don't see the line suddenly becoming thick or thin so one performance is very consistent and that gets five out of five stars from me as well
now if you are thinking of getting this tablet to draw with your Android devices well the performance with Android is the heat and miss the thing with Android is there are so many variables that can affect its performance such as which Android OS version
I hope it's helpful
the Lenovo tab is seven is one of the cheapest tablets you can buy starting at just $50 you can't expect high-end hardware however it is one of the first tablets to run Android gold
I don't mind a low resolution that much sure text could look a bit sharper but it's the user blur the main downside of the screen is that it is not an IPS panel in fact the usable viewing angles are pretty low especially from the left side when looking on the screen directly it looks alright but even then it kind of looks like there
MT 8167 quad-core processor
which is supported by 1 gigabyte of RAM additionally we get a gigabyte - 6 thinking about of internal storage if you want you can get it with built-in 3G - this version features an empty 8321 quad worship but the performance should be similar
there's another thing
I noticed was chrome
C mobile or fortnight at all on here however it is good enough for simpler games like subway surfers or so that one's fine and I've even been able to play that we got two pretty nicely
oh we're goin
Lenovo type e 10
Tilly no vote
I hope that the battery life would be decent but that is not the case and my battery test that got in one time of six hours only for the state
I'm always looping in HD video at medium brightness for Windows tablets or 6 hours would be fine but almost all Android tablets last longer well on a positive note
I like that
it's only downside
you can notice another jump in performance and quality with the shoe behind and pro that one is an 8 inch tablet with a very pretty screen a good enough performance and him every body it is running Google Android 2 however since you probably have to imported from China
alright that's my
a 15 graphics tablet just wanted to let you know that although week approached me for a review and sent me the drawing tablet they did not sponsor this video in particular so we are starting with a quick a minute of unboxing
so that's nice
USB C 2 USB a which can be unplugged from the tablet that else if you're traveling and you would need to transport your tablet there is a nib removal tool and 20 spare nibs which is a bit too many but better have many than few
I just plug the graphics tablet in the computer and it installed the default drivers as you can see the tablet is responsive but does not detect the pressure sensitivity so what I'm going to do now is download the driver package from VX website
you can also use like gates to fine-tune your pressure sensitivity preferences in the little rectangle right down there so there was a small issue where a fire alpaca would not detect the pressure sensitivity so
I'm going to do a quick restart of the program and let's see how we get on and there we go and surely enough as long as I don't try to paint with white
the transition was smooth
I've already tried that
I tried to map a few keys like control Z or B and E to switch between brush and eraser and it was all working good and finally about this which is pretty self-explanatory other than the fact that you can manually check for updates here overall the interface of the drivers is quite intuitive
so in the mapping I got it mapped to only one of my monitors and that seems to be working quite well so I've read online that the tablet doesn't have a tilt functionality unfortunately I don't have any brushes to test that width and since I'm not using it I don't really count it as a big loss for me just wanted to let you know guys in here in case one of you needs it
it is solid and simple material does not feel like super cheap plastic and the pen sits nicely in the hands and the pen is a bit thicker as I mentioned but I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get used to it
I think you will be all set so when I first opened the tablet I used it for about 2 hours and I think that uncertain that I would mind using it for our longer drawing session as well it feels great working with it
the smudge guard
Goa fits well on my hand and makes me feel one level closer to professional I personally would have went with gold however sadly it was not up to me to choose the color and on to performance drawing simple lines and a few simple expressions
I can say that there was no problem there zooming to show you a bit more detail of the pressure sensitivity and I think it responds pretty well and now I'm moving to testing the buttons
the other button is mapped to a toggle between a pen and eraser and it would even tell you what function you're toggling at the moment at the bottom of your screen here comes the final product the keys get a perfect 12 are 12 score and I would even throw in 2 points bonus because of the pen buttons
it restarted my PC twice instead of once on during the Installer and you need to actually click twice on the install button for some reason to get the process started but beyond that nothing major so anybody should be able to handle it
I wanted which took me to random blank page on the site I was supposed to click on the file name that I wanted instead but this is nothing to do with
the device feels good
so max points here
I like the pen
I'd go for that
I would definitely be using it so if you want to see the results it produces make sure you subscribe to the channel so in the next couple of days
YouTube can promote this to other people as well and once again I do want to remind you that the pig did send me the tablet but this video has not really been sponsored by them
hey there everyone
it didn't break my tablet but that's not to say will not break yours so make sure to back up your operating system on a USB flash drive before doing the update or by any other means necessary
my scale read 307
HOME key and on the forehead of the tablet is a two megapixel camera its stead centered not the greatest for selfies but decent to catch a few pictures of documents and it does okay with Skype beta
cause it's not the best but it's there in case you ever need it up here is the HDMI output a microUSB port and next to a 3.5 millimeter jack
eighty three gigahertz
the memory on this is two gigs of RAM and 32 gigabyte of storage which is enough to run Windows on it and do some major updates like the anniversary update that requires 16
so there is no need to side loaded on an SD card or a flash drive this is expandable to 64 gigs but I have heard that others have been able to use 124
this has a 8 inch full HD IPS touchscreen display with its width being 1920 and its height 1200 hence the 1920 by 1200 resolution this supports 10 finger multi-touch which is very sensitive the viewing angles on this is awesome but it can be very reflective and it's not bright enough to use in a sunny day the Texas sharp and colors are very vibrant when you turn on the tablet for the first time the icons are super small that they have a piece of construction paper showing you how to change the screen icons I set mine to 175 percent but you can change it to whatever feels good to you or leave it at it's preset for those of you out there with Hawkeye vision and great finger precision
but big enough for your fingers not to accidentally touch the screen when holding it the chin and forehead are a bit thick but it doesn't look bad at all well at least
I don't think so
the volume rocker is placed right below the power button with no texture to distinguish it from it so at night you may find yourself accidentally turning off the screen
just in case you did not know that the tablet comes with a USB OTG which is on-the-go cable with one end being a micro USB and the other USB type a so you can plug in your flash drive and transfer files or create a backup of your operating system with that
another thing to know
I have not been able to find a case specifically for this tablet but there are some cases out there on Amazon that are universal but I haven't tried it yet and you can see here that my tablet is cuffed up on the back from leaving it on counters so I downloaded office on it
and it's pretty useful
Tim this is an issue at night if you want to watch 2 or 3 videos of YouTube before you go to sleep and those couple videos turn to 15 videos
your eyes will get strained because as low as brightness setting still bright which forced me to download flux to dim it which helps only slightly but the light being emitted still pretty bright so
I have it here
compared to my Nexus 6p the tablet's lowest brightness is a bit over halfway brightness on my phone and right now I put on the max and yes I disabled auto brightness on the phone so one of the things I saw a lot of people complain about was the lack of the keyboard popping up automatically when clicking on the search bar that is mainly due to having it on desktop mode
if you put it on tablet mode the keyboard will show up automatically once you click on the search bar just in case you're unfamiliar with that so now the big question is is this tablet worth buying or the answer to this question is yes and no it all depends on what kind of user you are
every now and then
so that may be another issue if you're looking to game on this for a while if you want this for productivity this is a great but option it can run for
Microsoft Office smoothly
they have been working great for the past year with the Windows tablet you can watch videos that require Flash Player since the Android tablets or iPads on support Flash Player but there is the alternative of downloading a browser that is that has its own type of Flash Player integrated to play videos on the Android tablet or iPad but the Windows tablet
just around the corner
this is an exceptional tablet making it a great last-minute gift that that is if you buy within the next few days and if you have Amazon Prime so this tablet's performance is on par with a $200 tablet so the tablet is very responsive and all the touches are recognized
what's happenin panda
Nation Peter Brown
Panda you know that
I'm really excited about
it's by Van
so theoretically you could get all of that on this tablet customize it the way you want and you're not gonna break the bank on it so we do have some film on here remove
I will say it
here's the Amazon
you know
headphone jack right there
SD card slot
that's really why
we get guide here
pretty big instruction booklet and then little box of micro USB cable for charging and also pretty nice little power Brook right there so get all that - alright so I see the tablet is powering up
we'll find our Detroit Wi-Fi network and get it connected alright so I killed some of the lights behind me just to get rid of some of the glare and I went ahead through the basic setup process here which was just connecting it to the Wi-Fi network and but I think I like about this is obviously will reorient based on its accelerometer but I really love the aspect ratio of the screen
I think the screen looks pretty nice here and if I go to the browser so if I go to YouTube here it goes to the mobile version and then if I just tap on something here funny animals volume well he was going on
I will also say I can feel the sound because I think those speakers are in my back side of the tablet here hey um I will say I've got the volume turned all the way up and like I said I can feel it in my hands here the way it is
you know vibrating
I wouldn't listen to it that loudly and if I were on a plane or traveling I would certainly have my headphones in also say my Wi-Fi signal is not the greatest where I'm at right here but I just want to show you here now
I mean I feel like the Venky Oh feels larger because you don't have as much of that ribboning effect so I like the layout and the size of the screen here on the bank you better but I will say
fire tablet now
I will also say though in the the biggest comparison piece here is the price point so the Amazon Fire HD 10 is a hundred and forty nine dollars and as Venky OH is $99
so you're going to save fifty dollars but you're gonna get a raw clean install in my opinion of Android the real problem with this and you can do it on the Amazon fire
tablets is that they don't come or have any access to the Google Play Store normally and so you have to do some workarounds to get that now if you want to stay only in the Amazon ecosystem that can be fine but if you really want a raw Android experience and be able to customize it any way you want and load anything you want on it then I think you want to go with this sucker and I would say that at $99 it can just make a great large tablet
Brown panda out
I mean it's one side can be used to create art on your laptop computer or mobile phones using different software's like any other tablet but its other side can be used to directly create art on it without connecting it to any other device basically it has an ePaper technology on the other side which can be used to create quick sketches doodles or writing
I will show you how to use it but first let's unbox it and I will show you what are the contents in the box and then I will give a detailed review about it and show you how to use it so stay tuned and watch it till the end
X 320 m so
this is a tablet it has 11 buttons one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 and 11 so this is the one side of the tablet and this was this is the other side which I was talking about this is an LCD display
then these are two
so you can use the OTC for connecting this tablet to your mobile phones one is type C and one is microUSB so these are all the contents of the box and one more thing they had also sent this bag to keep or to carry the tablet safely
looks very nice
let's open this cable
USB end to the laptop and this end to the tablet like this and the USB to your laptop and the device is connected a small light will blink here this white LED and it will look like this as I have opened here in the press key section of the tablet you can assign various functions to the hotkeys on the tablet and the disturbance section
in the work area section you can select the work area of the device by default this at a spool area and for a left-hander or a lefty you can click on 180 degree here and it will invert the tablet for a lefty
I forgot to tell you the price of this tablet the MRP written on the box is nine thousand rupees but on Amazon India you can purchase it for approximately six thousand rupees
and then you can click pictures of it if you want to keep it as a memory or if you want to post it somewhere and I think it's a very nice ePaper technology so this was a detailed review of this one
dual side tablet
thanks for watching
hi i'm warren buck
if you're expecting a professional grade graphics tablet you'll be disappointed however the art studio that comes with the program called you draw studio is actually quite serious and has a lot of graphic effects
that's pretty cool
inch tablet so
let's further delay
let's get started okay
it's a 0.2 ounce charger and the standard USB cable and they've also included a headset with the box there are cuts and name printed there and the manual with warranty card
that's it inside the box and it what look like after finishing all the initials of the dice and is all that they are pre-installed and I have painted all the apps Google Play service etcetera then now I will play you via video and the audio
we can play
STD space okay
let's check the settings
it's currently running on
Android new with 7.0
so that's it
welcome to Greg Iles
touch k10 10.1
inch tablet now
I caught a 720p
Plus display it has 16 gigabytes of internal storage with the ability to throw in a micro SD card for up to 128 gigabytes of storage also has a a mini
HDMI port
up here so if you want to plug this into a monitor or a TV you definitely can micro USB port to charge it which is kind of disappointing because every almost everything is USB
so it's not a ton of mount of RAM for it runs Android 8.1 and then other than that you get a quad core 64-bit processor Wi-Fi which is gonna be 2.4
gigahertz no 5 gigahertz
it's pretty good
unfortunately there's no even though those videos at 4k you can't do 2k or even 1080 at only place at 720 which is fine because that's all this is at as for sound
it's muffled and it doesn't get very loud so I would say that's one of the bad things about this tablet is that the sound is not good at all but videos look generally good and then like
it's not that bad
there you go
I wouldn't do you know heavy gaming on this or video editing or anything like that because it's gonna be a pain in the butt if you like to use Instagram
good you can see
there's a slight
you know framerate issues when you play it it's not going to you're not kentucky's on YouTube and you know make videos at least I would recommend you don't so you know camera is nothing to write home about but if you need them in a pinch they're definitely there for video conferencing or just taking photos and videos overall as for battery life
you can get about 5 hours of battery life on this if you're just going to not do videos and just really light stuff like maybe web browsing and reading and things like that you can get about 7 hours of battery life so you know probably count more towards
listen to music
has so you get the access to the Google Play Store without having to do anything special like you would on a fire tablet which is always great to see you can see how much storage you have left the overall you know just real basic
I literally had the Google Apps and that's it so you're not gonna have any extra apps on there that you don't want and then I added a few of my own on here and that's it and that's great because a lot of time you get these cheaper tablets and they're loaded with bloatware
it's for somebody that is looking to get maybe into technology like an older person that doesn't want to spend a lot but they still want to be able to do things on the Internet fairly easy like browse the web play some light games listen to music and it has Bluetooth and a headphone jack
so you can improve the sound that way as well so overall not a bad tablet for under a hundred bucks for what it is if you want to pick it up it's linked down below it has
GPS and FM is supported as well and so some cool stuff in there and then also in the Box you only get a micro USB and a charging brick and that's it so thanks for watching
I took delivery of it about a week and a half ago and I've been putting it through its paces ever since and boy am I glad I took a look at this one
I post a new video and don't forget to check me out on my social media especially Twitter cuz that's where I post all the latest updates now one of the reasons I wanted to check this two and one out is because it's on sale right now over at Lenovo you can get some pretty good deals for some pretty good specs so one of the reasons again
I wanted to check this out is because I think it's a pretty good competitor for the surface pro 6 in many ways now before we get to the unboxing
LCD display
it's absolutely gorgeous
you can configure it
up to one
it's really excellent now
that should be durable over the long haul and should have little flex it's put through 12 military standard tests to ensure its durability lives up to the ThinkPad standard you get a 1 year warranty with all models that you can extend if you want now when it comes to the port's you get to Thunderball 3 ports a microSD card slot and an optional
Thunderbolt 3 ports are concerned they do support four lanes so if you want to connect to an external GPU or multiple 4k monitors you have that option now before we get to the display
10 Professional OAM Keys Microsoft Office keys steam CD keys mini games and so much more and they all come in at a fantastic price and I have some great news
Microsoft Office $31.50
that's a steal lead
seven dollars
Microsoft Office
LCD display absolutely gorgeous
it's a 3k display
it's a multi-touch display
it's really responsive
I have to say I think lenovo did a fantastic job when it comes to this display and because it has a 3,000 by 2,000 resolution looking at 277 pixels per inch
that's fantastic
I absolutely love this display and it also covers the color gamut really well at 120 percent srgb so if you're a creative professional this is a definitely a tuned
of course this wouldn't be a think pad without its legendary think pad keyboard and I'm happy to report that this does come with an excellent type cover with that great keyboard
I absolutely love and which more manufacturers would include in their devices having said that I think this is far superior in my opinion than the type cover would get with the surface pro 6
that has some really strong magnets giving you a really secure connection so in that regard it's really great and of course this being a surface like device with that kickstand gives you some really excellent viewing angles and it's an excellent design overall
well how's the performance
it's really good now
you can get it obviously with the core i5 or the core i7 and I put up the performance numbers for both as you can see the core i7 8650 you with the V Pro obviously did better than the Core i5 8250 you but that's to be expected but again either one will do very well
each gen now
ram the better
of course so if you want to do any kind of video editing or any kind of gameplay on this I would go with the core i7 of course and get as much RAM as you can but of course this is not a gaming machine this is not gonna play any triple-a titles you're not gonna do any 4k video editing
I thought it was pretty good not the best but I thought they did a decent job in terms of heat management now when I put it under heavy load during my streaming 15 minute HD video test it did reach 101 Fahrenheit or 38.3 degrees Celsius which is a little bit warm but not overly odd and not uncomfortable to the point we can touch the back so keep that in mind but I think overall I did a decent job in terms of the heat management now unlike the surface pro 6 you can get inside this device you can upgrade the SSD but the RAM unfortunately soldered on so
you won't be able to upgrade that but if you do want to upgrade the SSD you have that option although you do get some really good reads and writes as you can see from these results and it's pretty simple to get inside all you have to do is remove some Phillips head screws from the back and you're in well performance is good so far but what about battery life how about longevity well lenovo claims up to nine and a half hours of use on a charge it does have a 42 watt hour battery
unfortunately those claims don't hold up with the core i5 you're looking at 6 hours and 20 minutes and the core i7 you're looking at a little under 6 hours
the surface pro six
they do supply
let me know now
millimeter headset jack
it's bright vivid
3k display excellent keyboard
the touchpad is great and so is that TrackPoint optional LTE good port selection Thunderbolt 3 support and its user upgradeable something that the surface pro 6 is not now
of course
it's not perfect
I absolutely love it
the design is excellent
this is no exception
it's got that mill
you will be wiping it down but when it is clean it really looks gorgeous and I have no complaints on that front but then again you will be carrying a cleaning cloth because it does collect fingerprints rather easily but overall I think it really does the job and it's an excellent surface pro 6 alternative and in a lot of ways it may be even a better value because you do get the pen and you do get the keyboard included
please share this video
let me know how
this little baby here
this is a eight inch android 10 tablet and it costs round about 80 a pound and i will stick a link in the video description in case you want to go and check it out and it's a company i've never heard of before so i'm not going to try and pronounce their name
it's google gms certified
so basically
google prioritized test suites
move that away
peel this off
was it got reset
slow shouldn't i
so this is it
let's see what acid is in the box in case there's other stuff like a uh usb cable for charging it up a little two pin connection charger just a standard charger
yeah very nice
that's very good
i like that
so what we're going to do now is charge you up and uh i'm going to quit reading the instructions right so it's all charged up one thing to note
it is not an in-depth guide and there's no pictures or not many anyway so it doesn't show you what all the connections are which is a a little bit unusual
you will find them in the manual even in the quick guideline but it gives you a brief idea what they are down now and how to use the tablet but this is like i said a quick guide one thing
so they're two megapixels and five megapixels so i'm guessing that's a five and that's the two on the front or on this side so what we're going to do now is turn on
oh there you go clock's a bit out says almost you know 10 o'clock but it's not obviously we're gonna have to set up so it's connected to the network and that so you have a number of apps already on here so maps files gmail apk pure whatever that is and if you add oh that's loud maybe jump and turn the volume down a bit so volume adjustment is really easy to do which is nice if i press that
google play protect
get rid of that
drive your files google
usual stuff play store
have a quick look
turn on no thanks
wi-fi is off
so we want it on and i'm going to skip all this bit because you don't need to see this right so wi-fi is now set up so that like i said quite easy
there you go
so you've got kindle i mean you want to see how fast it is so it wants me to sign in so right so that worked fine it played okay
this is not expensive
have a look yes
and how'd you play
it's not bad though
i'll give it that
take her outside right
okay not brilliant by any standards but it is okay if you are looking for a cheap tablet that can play games on it which we just proved it can or if you want to watch video from say for instance youtube
i will stick a link in the video description because you want to go and check it out and uh if you like this video give us a thumbs up
I've ordered it but I'm waiting on it to ship and that one should definitely perform much better than this but it's got a higher price tag so in this video
they wanted to release a cheap tablet to make some extra cash around the holidays so they released the m7 because all in all the performance on this thing isn't great but I do personally really love the form factor
we have our micro sd card slash semi gen slot if you pick up the LTE version but in this video we're gonna be dealing strictly with the Wi-Fi version so we only have an SD card slot over here like I mentioned
I really do
Amazon fire 7
1024 by 600 display a 3500 milliamp hour non user replaceable battery and they claimed up to 10 hours of video playback 16 gigabytes of internal storage plus a microSD card slot
AC Wi-Fi in this unit it only has 802 eleven b/g/n so we can't pick up that five gigahertz network and that really hurts when streaming two megapixel front and a two megapixel rear camera and they'll only shoot 720p 30fps and the whole system is running Android 9.0
there are a few extra side loaded apps but they can be deleted when you boot the unit up and Android go actually works quite well with one gigabyte of RAM as opposed to the regular old version of Android 9.0
I think one of the main thing that's hurting this tablet the most is the exclusion of AC Wi-Fi if this had AC Wi-Fi built in streaming would be pretty great on here but we're gonna go into Netflix now and I'm actually only about 12 feet from my router obviously I'm on a 2.4
Netflix is faster than most other apps that I've tested here because this is a very well optimized app but video playback does work and it actually works quite well as soon as everything's loaded up this does have Dolby audio built-in but there's only a single speaker on this unit
I've tested especially Disney
Plus now I know this was just released and they do have some optimizations to do but I think it should load a little quicker than it does you and I personally think this has to do with a combination of things the slower CPU and especially the slower
I also went through and tried to run some benchmarks now unfortunately antutu was not listed on the Google Play Store and 3dmark kept crashing the only one I could get to finish up was Geekbench four
simple here single-core
the fire
mobile are pretty much out of the question on this low-end chip and especially since we only have that one gigabyte of RAM but there are some games that actually run much better than I thought they was like hearthstone here now when I started up the game it did
give me a warning that my device isn't at the recommended specs for the game and it might be slow and I have noticed a few slowdowns here and there but the game is playable on the in Sabbath and the same goes for GTA san andreas now
Lenovo tablet and this one actually really surprised me because I did test some other games that are very well optimized for Android and I had a little trouble running on like believe it or not
but we're having a little trouble with the m7 so I figured I'd go ahead and test a lower-end 2d game so I went with stardew valley and I'm not sure if it's showing up here but when I go to tap on something I do get a bit of a stutter and keep in mind
I also had to test out some emulation on this device and I didn't even bother hooking up controller but it does have Bluetooth built in so you can use Bluetooth controllers this is FBA running Marvel vs. Street Fighter runs great here we're hitting full speed and I also went with some BS
while this isn't the easiest game to emulate we should be able to run this at full speed using retro art and for my test that hovers around forty five forty seven but I've seen it go as low as 40 - so we're far from full speed on ps1 emulation so overall the lenovo
I'd be all over it every day but until then we're gonna be stuck with these low-end chips in these cheaper tablets and it's really unfortunate because I'm a big fan of the Android tablet community and we just haven't had anything good except for that guy
Android tablet ever created
this is the same
call a duty pop
one's gonna run fine on that tablet so if you're interested in checking out that review definitely hit the subscribe button because it's coming in soon but as for the m7
or if there's anything else you want to see running on the lenovo tab m7 for any reason at all just let me know in the comments below but like always
thanks for watching you
seven inch kids tablet
you get the uh
it does say here
nice frozen two
you swipe it up
ask for a password
of course
so there's not much on here the last seven days it's been unused because i've been plotting on a bit and all time gives you a good idea as well
you can set how long they can play the device for and how long for on weekdays and weekends and of course the apps you can actually see the size of the apps the use of the apps and hdz you cannot delete them even if we click on it so you just you can actually play it yourself and see what it's like so that's basically the print or screen where you control everything
now before you actually set up your your kit to actually play this you will have to enter an email address and a few of the odds and ends and of course you need to have wi-fi so let's enter the kids here we are
media is always empty
let's go see me box on this one more so it has all those so there's quite a lot of books already in here then you have the learn materials and it goes on forever so you can learn english you can do some fun reading abc's the shapes and sizes and colors sight and words so when they see something attached to words music
cut the rope
that's just amazing
asterix is on here
oh i wonder if these are on these are probably all on the uh google store and that's why they're on here as well because they're probably chosen kids and they allow them on here but i'm hoping that they do have an administrator just in case some nasty person on there choosing kids as well there we go so that's basically it now
he'll love it
there's a volume
sven the reindeer is forever trying to kiss his nose and queen elsa and princess anna always use their royal manners olaf is special because he finds beauty in every okay
that's enough that's what you basically get and that's the idea behind the actual reading book so you actually can read them and you can actually listen to them as well
it had the protection of for them to have the storybooks for them the education for them and they won't even have a clue that they're being educated because they'll be having fun and the best thing is no money
thanks for watching
i was just joking
yes that's possible
also you can change the dock area which is pretty nice if you have this unit somewhere lower in the dash to be able to see the weather and other real-time information such as sport scores
and there's also this app called browser but i never figure out how to do what it says to browse the web pages this home screen layout it's fully customizable
which is another device that connects to your car and takes all the data from the computer that way you will be able to change things like climate control and even get your factory
now it's time to check out the apple carplay and as you can see the screen doesn't have that smooth and responsive feeling has just a little bit of lag which is a bit disappointing for its price tag
adjustment setting will let you customize the color of the screen based on your preference which is pretty nice and also they will be saved for the night mode or the daytime when it comes to customizing things
switching to the audio settings here we find something very interesting which is called master sound reviver this basically takes the music and converts it to high resolution audio technology available only by pioneer and thumbs up for the user interface
here we can set up our video formats for the cameras and seems to me that you won't be able to connect an hd camera or i may be wrong if you guys know anything about that
don't forget to subscribe
they're mostly the same
the black one just adds an eraser at the tip so you can just flip it over to erase instead of using the on screen options to erase a little bit quicker with that
that has a bunch of different options for writing on the screen you got different thicknesses different pencil and pen types it's got pressure sensitivity and tilt uh the delay is so like minute you really can't notice it at all
it's 21 milliseconds
so the stylus
they've got these uh little rubber pads in each corner so it keeps it from sliding around on your desk when you're writing which is quite nice and you got the power button up here top left corner and it's got a usbc port on this edge as well so it's kind of a cool design and they also sell these covers separately where it has a magnet in the spine and you just attach the remarkable to the magnet it holds it very securely so i'll probably do a different uh different video to show the covers a little bit more but it's pretty cool how it fits in there like that
you can also create folders and then you can rename your different items right here and you can do some different things when you long press so you like the option to duplicate you can star so it'll show up in your favorites list and then you got some
or you can use a web browser to transfer content to your markable and to sync your content to and from that but so you can't just like load it in on your computer and sideload documents that way you have to use their app
once you open up a notebook you do have a number of templates to choose from for your notes and you can change this later as well but once you choose one of these you'll get this loaded up in your notepad you can add pages you got some different options down here so you can show the you can also switch over to landscape view and you got the different layers so if you wanted to do your notes in different layers you got that option so they got a couple of different transferring options you can send by email
uh the text selection tool the eraser uh different line thicknesses and of course you got the different uh options for your writing uh so each one has like different price pressure sensitivity
uh if you look up close uh and then like the other ones like the marker doesn't have much as much pressure sensitivity and stuff like that but this is just kind of a quick look at the different writing options you have with the remarkable the scribble and the label were written with the medium thickness
um and then again like if you press down soft it'll be a darker or if you push down soft it'll be a lighter line if you press down hard it'll be a darker line so it's all the pressure sensitivity with the uh it's got like 4096 layers levels of pressure sensitivity so like different
this uh straight liner
it's only going to show up when you have like different color like black content and then you've also got the gray color as well so this applies to all your different pens and pencils
uh it's pretty accurate
like doesn't get backslash
uh it kind of thinks it's an l or something that kind of depends but as far as the conversion feature goes though i mean it does work quite well and you can send that via email easy way to convert your handwritten text or handwritten notes into typed text
there is no web browser or anything like that but you do have the ability to transfer documents using the app and using a web browser on your computer if you wanted to plug in with the usb cable so they do have that option right there
it's a beta feature
so we'll go switch over to the large for a little while so you guys can kind of see what that looks like and then when you go back to the home screen it will have uh larger icons as well when you switch over to the cover view you can see
uh you can
ebooks and pdfs
you might see on a typical e-reader so like i said this is more geared toward the note-taking aspects uh but it does double as an e-reader the features just aren't quite as advanced as you might expect from a typical reading device
they're staying in their lane with the notepad type features here so it doesn't have any kind of you know it doesn't have a dictionary if you hold down a word doesn't have pinch zooming hyperlink so like trying to tap the footnote link there doesn't activate that it's definitely a different experience than something you might expect on like a kindle ereader for instance
i mean it does serve as you know a basic uh text ereader and you've also got uh the pdf support so when you're reading ebooks you've got some different adjustment options
it'll give you that warning but you do have these six different fonts sizes to choose from you got the left justification full justification a couple different page margin options and line spacing options and a few different font choices so not a whole lot of features but enough to get the job done as far as you know basic layout settings here larger font sizes are kind of nice
is this ebook
you can run searches within your ebook and it'll give you a list of all your results and you can tap on that and we'll take you to the location but it'll also include words that just have partially uh the word you typed in as well so let's switch over to a pdf with the larger screen
cropping and zooming modes
the text automatically
you can write directly on pds of course then you can export or sync it to remarkable account to get the notes off of there when you sync you can like immediately get the notes directly onto your mobile device easily or like using the web browser on your desktop device to get the notes off of here so you've got the usual note-taking options you got undo the same stuff i showed you earlier
as far as you can switch to landscape mode you can switch over to the multi-page view here to sort of navigate your device uh when you're exporting you can choose different pages this way as well so this is kind of the one aspect where like the remarkable has one gigabyte of ram uh dual core 1.2 gigahertz processor
um as far as note-taking you know and e-reading it's it's pretty quick as far as an ink device to goes um you got the table of contents view as well as one long list and then you've got these different zoom options for pdf as well if you wanted to use the zoom dial and then we'll pop up this little icon in the side here
this is one thing
of course
so ink does have its advantages and they made the screen feel a lot more paper-like than the typical tablet when your writing kind of even has the sound and feel of a paper uh experience but you know just kind of comes down to the type of advice you're looking for again the reading features on here are kind of basic but serviceable the it's really more of a note-taking device that's their specialty with the different types of pens a different type of sensitivity and tilt and all that kind of stuff so i'm gonna go ahead and wrap up this video
I was wrong
I've seen this year not only due to the viewing angles but also the low resolution especially for an eleven point five inch display when the viewing angles weren't an issue
strong to stay
click on here the
Galileo has four colors to pick from the one I have is in blue and it isn't so bad but it may tend to stand out a little on one side you have all the ports and buttons with a USB port that can be used to plug in a mouse or keyboard power button with the volume keys behind it 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
microphone and behind it
that's not so great
with more extensive heavy use it would probably be around 4 hours and it takes 4 hours to recharge so this two-in-one hybrid tablet is good but may not be enough to replace an everyday laptop unless all you really need to do is casually browse the web type up a document and play some games
it's actually much better than expected but I've seen the price drop down to as low as seventy six dollars on Walmart's website so wait until then if you can to pick this up if you can't wait that long then also check out the Viking pro and maven pro tablets
GT 191 tablet
I'll be going through my initial thoughts on the tablet and what I like and dislike about the tablet apologies if I mispronounce some of the tablet names since I've never really said them out loud before if you follow me on instagram you may know that
I've had this tablet for a couple of months now and I've been using ever since the tablet comes with the HDMI cable the pen holder the USB the power adapter the pen and the power cables both fitted for the u.s. in the EU
the buttons on
the pen are customizable
the stand can be made as flat as you want which is great as the screen being too high can hurt your hand so I'm Gladys has no fixed position now I have everything set up
the driver was easy all I had to do was go to the side and make sure I was done within the new there are a lot of drivers and I almost done
you're given a program in which you can edit the settings for the buttons on the monitor the pen and the work area and all the information about the tablet
it's easy to navigate
it's all pretty self-explanatory
I don't have to adjust the pen pressure after downloading a driver even though I have the option to after downloading the driver of the pen worked fine and had no lag or jittering lines
I had no thoughts
the monitor is good for me as I'm usually doing a million other things as well as drawing like watching videos or gathering references or it's just nice to have a separate screen dedicated to drawing
I've also used
Wacom tablets all my life and this monitor doesn't feel like a downgrade or incomparable to Wacom tablets even though I can't compare how it feels to draw as this is my first ever monitor
Wakeham drivers depend
Chrome the problems
and if your monitor isn't working after downloading the driver it may be because you have another driver on your system that is incompatible if you want to use one tablet you have to uninstall the other and we install it when you want to use it again
I'm away from home
the buttons on the pen can be used to toggle different brushes and the eraser tool on your software but I personally prefer having a razor at the end of the pen
with the monitor
and computers via a wireless usb like all the human tablets do as it mean less wires and that's nice welcome seems to be everyone's first tablet but I don't see why you can't go to human
the only difference is I know of that the Cintiq have three has a Cintiq has a three-in-one cable to connect it to your laptop or your computer and here one has three separate cables and it's incompatible with Wacom drivers
what's the deal folks
welcome to device overdose
this device was one of my first reviews after starting the channel last summer and surprisingly some of my subscribers have hit me up with questions regarding the device so today i am going to revisit the design
providing you purchase ineligible 4g lte data plan now you will not be making any calls from the device but you can enjoy unlimited 4g internet wherever you go all right
lg has been doing some interesting things when it comes to their mobile devices they have even managed to release the fifth version of their g-pad tablet back in november of 2019.
i applaud you lg
your boy the ten dollar word but anyway obviously the device is intended for light diurnal usage according to the hardware that lg put inside this tablet however the price i paid for this tablet would suggest otherwise on the front of the device
let's take a look
let's keep it moving
alright next
pi and i have not received a software update since i purchased the device and i do not foresee any updates coming in the near future or ever again for that matter but on the bright side android 9 is a really good os all right keeping it
i tried to kill this battery using several different digital methods with no success so i decided to leave the tablet running overnight and the next morning the damn battery was still going so yeah
millimeter jack now
299 green stamps
in my opinion the g-pad 5 is a mid-range tablet with inconsistent stability low memory and the questionable processor however if the budget is low the g pad will run you 1250 a month plus 10 green stamps for unlimited 4g lte data
that's not too bad
hold it down
i'm your host
it's high-powered yet
which is a 64-bit quad-core cortex x86 processor clocked in it between 1 and 1.5 gigahertz and it includes Intel's HD graphics this model came with 2 gigabytes of RAM a 64 gigabyte internal SD card and two megabytes of cash
it's running full blown
Android KitKat 4.4
point for pre-installed
if your local carrier provides wcdma or gsm service it will not only give you full internet but it can also be used as a full-featured phone just plug in a sim card
that's a micro sim
that's for your 3g connection and finally you've got a microphone at the bottom now if we flip to the very bottom you'll find the all-important micro USB power charging port and data port
so they creatively
these are stereo speakers when this is held in the portrait format ok since it is an Android tablet it does support google play store with a valid Google email
it's pretty snappy
ok now this also came pre-installed with a variety of applications but since it was primarily designed for the chinese market most of those applications were in chinese only so i just blew out the Chinese language apps and most could be an installed but just a very few had to be disabled
along with the tablet our guides for the Android and Windows operating systems in English very cursory reviews of those mind you then there are too much more detailed guides but unfortunately these are Chinese
which is your USB data cable and charging cable this cable unfortunately is 28 and a half inches tip to tip so it's too short for all but the very few charging situations and virtually impossible to use while using the tablet so I wind up using a USB cable extension and then we have another cable that was included which is interesting
it's a beautiful display
I actually have this
and then you can't see anything else but I'm just going to turn it up for just a moment to title let you get an idea of what the display is actually capable of
look at that
is that not impressive
point for it sports
it's at a great price point making it a super value for someone who has a budget and still wants a full-featured Android tablet and of course let's not forget it's also a full-featured Windows 8.1 tablet with office 365 so it's fully compatible with any Windows desktop and would make a perfect companion for a traveling office
let me close
not just this tablet
free and much faster
hi everyone today
I'm bringing you a review of the Eugene 1910 B and I'm going to jump right in and tell you what this tablet includes when you buy it it comes with two rechargeable pins plus two USB charging cords for each pen a pen holder containing eight nips and a nib remover a USB to USB a/b cord a power adapter and a power cord a vga cable and an installation CD and user manual while the manual doesn't say it is compatible with Windows Tim
I always highly suggest we're going the CD to go to the producers website and download the latest drivers for your operating system there instead so until the specs plug will say that this tablet is quite heavy and it is very very sorry feeling
space for this in
it has a reading height of a half-inch in other words how high you can hover the pin and still control the cursor without touching the screen it also has a VGA and DVI input there is no HDMI input and the stand is adjustable for multiple angles and has a rubber feet to keep from slipping the stand can lie almost flat and can stand up straight at nearly 90 degrees from the desk
time the buttons on the bottom right of the tablet stick out just slightly but are actually very hard to press so there's no chance of actually pressing the power button with your elbow or something while drawing which is good using the onboard menu
time either way
correct your work
maybe over time it will but after the hours I spent working on it and the surface was completely unmarked that being said I'm a very very light handed artist moving on to the pen
in the pen they're easy to remove with the nib extractor and just as easy to replace the nibs included are all the same and have no variation when the pen is at low battery
I couldn't change the buttons to undo and redo like I normally do that being said I use a customized keypad where I set up all of my keyboard shortcuts and I went ahead and added undo and redo to the keypad so that I could at least have those buttons at hand all now
level display tablet
so that's about it
Put it in portrait orientation and it almost feels like a joke compared to tablets like the Nexus 7. Up front you’ll find a 10.6” screen with a resolution of 1366x768 which matches most Windows laptops.
Below the display
there’s a capacitive
Around back you’ll see the tablet is made out of what Microsoft calls VaporMG which feels mostly like aluminum. The kickstand is an important part of the Surface as it allows you to use it like a laptop.
This isn’t entirely a downside as many apps will be ported over to the Windows Store which is the only way to get apps but it’s still something to keep in mind if you’re planning on picking up the Surface as a laptop replacement.
In some ways it does a great job, you’ve got all day battery life, a USB port to use a hard drive, card reader or anything else along with a keyboard and trackpad that you can fold away into the space of a tablet.
collagen is one of the important parts of our body but we produce less of it as we age which leads to wrinkles and a lose of elasticity and firmness in our skin but let me remind everyone that still it is not a sponsored product

today i hope not
uh this is a pretty recent tablet that uh just came out a couple of weeks ago we finally got our hands on it and we'll do a full review on it so let's get right into it
you can see that
it is shaped on kind of a 16 by 10 aspect ratio making it great for watching movies and perhaps surfing the web but it also makes it kind of awkward to hold in that landscape format especially when you're using the keyboard in terms of physical dimensions
it's all right
i mean if you look at most tablets out there most of them are kind of uncomfortable if you hold them for more than two hours and this is really no exception
it's although it's great for watching movies and maybe youtube videos in that 16 by 10 aspect ratio but when we start looking at typing with this thing for long periods of time or using it for web pages
compared to some of those more square tablets but again for some people they might prefer this longer design than some of those square tablets so it is kind of a personal preference however even though the toshiba thrive is a little bit bigger and a little bit heavier than most tablets that are out there
in terms of how many ports it has along its physical exterior when held in landscape mode at the bottom of the device is located a serial port dock connection as well as two small speakers located on both sides of the device on the top left of the device contains the most important buttons that you're going to be using to operate this thing
the device on the right side contains a little flap that you have to remove once removes reveals a mini usb port a full size hdmi connection and a full size usb 2.0 connection these are extremely useful and very unique to this tablet just beside that array of ports lies a standard 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and a power connection at the front of the device
there are no buttons or anything making it fairly clean and minimalistic and there is a two megapixel front-facing camera and at the back of the device lies a pretty decent five megapixel camera
the screen of the toshiba thrive is measured at 10.1 inch diagonally and the aspect ratio is 16 by 10 and it uses a tft active matrix color lcd display with a led backlit the resolution of the lcd panel is actually 1280x800
saturated the sharpness levels of text photos and videos is also pretty darn good making the overall visual experience fairly high quality in terms of sensors it actually has a gyroscope a accelerometer ambient line sensor gps and a digital compass in terms of communication specifications
2.1 and broadcom 802.11
b g and n wi-fi connectability and the overall process of connecting to any kind of wi-fi network is fairly easy and straightforward after using this device for a couple of days and testing out the battery life and recharge times
although flash is fairly efficient overall compared to its desktop counterpart it does definitely affect battery life and it also makes the device increasingly hot one of my worries about in the future when owning this tablet for a long time is the problem what the heat will do in terms of damaging some of these silicone parts in there and the heat management should be probably improved in the later models in terms of the operating system
and if you've never used android 3.1 or any of the android operating systems what you find is that it's fairly easy to get into although it is a lot more deeper and much more customized than some of the ios devices and webos it is very fully featured and has some great benefits that some of those other operating systems don't have in terms of running application and using the device on a day-to-day basis
thanks to that
tegra 250 processor
this is extremely noticeable when you have a pretty high detailed video that might be encoded on a higher bit rate so it definitely has a problem with that compared to some of those other
you could just play movies or photos or share any kind of documents straight then without using any kind of other device making this a much more closer to a laptop or computer replacement than most of the tablets that are out there in the market additionally one of the greatest things about this device is its support for other peripheral devices such as a keyboard and mouse
that are out there
there are many great things about this device additional to these aspects but if we just briefly talk about some of the things that might be in room for improvement if toshiba wants to make a next generation version of this uh firstly i think the size and the weight should be improved drastically as we mentioned
when these new tablets are going to come out in the future this is of course going to be alongside with better software as developers create more efficient versions of flash and better html support
are these led lights that are located at the front of the device itself which can get pretty distracting when they flash and can get annoying when you're using this thing for a long time but overall to conclude
toshiba's really did a great job which matching the standards to really compete against some of those other devices it has some great unique features that a lot of the other tablets
don't have and it definitely has some downsides that other tablets do improve upon but the great thing about it is really the price i think if you buy this for under the 400 mark in terms of buying a current tablet is really fantastic and since you have the option to expand the memory on this
once you start looking at the price and specifications and start comparing some of the features to other tablets that are out there in the market but overall one of the most important points is you have to go and try this thing out for yourself and you could definitely compare it to some other tablets
that are out there
comparisons between the toshiba thrive and some other popular tablets such as the ipad 2 and the hp touchpad so make sure to subscribe to get those videos and to get all of our latest tech reviews uh and so make sure to subscribe to everything like this video and again thank you so much for watching and thank you for your support
who enjoy our videos

O and SketchBook Pro
I would have to say out of the two that Photoshop Elements 8 is probably my favorite due to the fact that it is a lot more useful in the line of work that I do
so what you'll notice
I'll show you sketchbook ultimate SketchBook Pro SketchBook Express I'll show you SketchBook Express and give you an idea of what that's like now the cool thing about this tablet is you get the multifunctional trackpad so you can
also you can move it around by using your hands your fingers pinch to zoom that type thing or you can slide out your pin and you can use it
I'm going to go ahead and use the pin for a drawing sake and show you a little bit of what it does one thing that you will want to note is you do have these four buttons included on the bamboo tablet
although there can be a purchased you can purchase the wireless extension kit which you'll pop in right there in that black area and it will allow you to use the tablet wirelessly
is this pin
I ordered this tablet because that's a big thing for me to have any racer and it does not well if you are looking for a pretty fantastic little tablet at a very very reasonable price
of course
this isn't for those professional artists who do that for a living but this is for the average person wanting something to make their job a little easier and graphic design or art
all that useful is a tablet just because it's so big it is only 2.4 pounds but it feels a lot heavier given its bulk and I think that is a strike against it
it is a touchscreen to really responsive as you'd expect that one of these touch screens to be my only complaint with it though it is it is a bit dim so it doesn't really get as bright as I would like it to now this computer because it is a computer is running with a Core M processor
you'll find at this price point so this is about $700 $6.99 it has 4 gigs of RAM though which is less than some of the other computers that cost the same so great
SSD for $6.99
this one has the same chip but half the RAM 4 gigs and only 128 gigabytes of on-board storage for that same $6.99 price tag so I think it's a little bit overpriced for what it is
what you have to do though is to attach the keyboard and then flip it around and then you can use the keyboard wirelessly so it is a wireless keyboard or you can dock it with the computer here and watch what happens
the keyboard is rigid enough that you can use it as a laptop so it doesn't get all floppy on you you can use it on your lap without any issues
a comfortable typing experience
I guess on the lap mainly you know my main gripes with saying it's sort of comfortable is the fact that the screen kind of lives in the middle of the device so it's a little bit weird to have that screen so close to the keyboard
there really hasn't been many laptops designed like this where the keyboard and the monitor are very or the screen are very close together like this then you can of course detach the keyboard and use it wirelessly
I think they should at least give you the keyboard some kind of power when it's plugged in because otherwise you're going to be draining the keyboard battery even when you're using it like most of us would dock to the front of the computer the only way to charge the keyboard is when it's uselessly docked to the back of the computer so you can certainly type on the keyboard while it's behind the screen but you can't see what's on the screen while it's charging which is unfortunate
power consuming but you have to remember to keep plugging the keyboard into the other side of the computer in order to get it charged and I thought that was a very odd decision
on their part the keys themselves are tiny and spaced too far apart so I really had a hard time typing very comfortably on it you'll notice also there's a lack of a trackpad
nubs here very similar to what you see on the think pads and a lot of other computers from the 90s and early 2000s have had these so not too bad but not maybe as useful as a trackpad might be especially for scrolling and that sort of thing of course you do have a touchscreen built into this device so you can do things like you know just tap on the screen and scroll with your finger or something like that but one thing that I noticed is that the screen is really bouncing quite a bit on here while you're using it which isn't too great even when you typing on there and your desk is moving a little bit
while you're going here is if you're on a train or a bus or something or a plane you might get a little motion sickness trying to use it that way
you have a USB 3 micro adapter here and this is for connecting USB 3 devices so it doesn't have a regular at least a regular USB 3 connector so you're gonna have to get some kind of adapter to get your hard drives and other USB 3 devices to plug into this thing because this doesn't have a standard USB connector that you'll see on most pcs so that's a problem for me there is a power adapter here so you can plug in there now
there is a regular USB port on here but this is only a USB 2.0 port on this side so it's a little bit slower than that other port on the other side of the computer on this side
jack at the top
some of that used up by the part you know the recovery partition and other things you have probably got a 100 gigabytes give or take of actual usable space on the drive
so having that memory card slot might be good for storing media and that sort of thing it is a micro SD card slot and it will sit flush to the monitor so it will work well as augmented storage now
I've been really impressed with lately because it does really perform nicely and doesn't consume a lot of power and allows us to make these fanless devices at least allows the manufacturers to make these family's devices so this one is fanless performs pretty
alright so
the mouse is a bit of a hassle to deal with who's I'm I'm just not used to using these little nub mice so there's a little difficult to get the mouse in the right spot but as you can see the page renders very quickly things scroll very nicely and it works quite well when you look at the benchmarks for Chrome I use a test called octane
which measures chromes ability to render javascript and other basic HTML functions on the device as you can see here the switch twelve scores 18700 which puts it about around the same speed as the ux305 from asus running with the same processor and as a point of comparison you can see how it compares to my old MacBook Air from 2012 which comes in at sixteen thousand 680 so as a web browsing device it does very well and I think you'll have a very good experience with it
they're a bit tinny
but it doesn't really sound all that great but though you can certainly play back video relatively quickly and if you have a decent internet connection you should have a good go at that
we're gonna do
Microsoft Word I've got this newsletter template that I like to run when I'm testing a computer out because it does have a lot of things like images and other things on here that tend to tax the processor a little bit more than other other things in Word might but as you can see as I scroll through here it seems to render everything very quickly
so if you're doing things like word processing and spreadsheets and whatever you're not gonna have any slowdown with this at all and this is not a gaming device by any stretch of the imagination but it can run games in one great game to test on hardware like this is minecraft and
I'm surprised by how well minecraft is performing on here because I'm getting better frame rates by and large than I am out of the asus ux305 running with the same processor so I don't know if it's just maybe the map that I'm on or something but as you can see I'm getting anywhere from like 80 to 75 frames per second and reading about 84 right now which is really really good for a core temp processor
so this is a pretty impressive display here at least for this particular game and one last thing to talk about and that is battery life you probably get about 5 or 6 hours
that sort of thing that's not what I experienced with it myself that was with the screen brightness up so think you might be able to squeeze a little bit more if you turn the brightness down on it but not great battery life either compared to some other computers that might be out there at this price point so I have to say you know
it's just it's a shame because it performs well but the hardware design is so bizarre that it really doesn't do either of the two things it tries to be which is a tablet and a laptop it what I would do is look at other
so you can get a laptop for $700 the tablet for about a hundred bucks and you'll have the best of both worlds with two devices designed to be what they are for under a thousand dollars and you'll be happy to go ahead and in that direction because getting this one just doesn't this doesn't do it for me
thanks for watching you
I'm Kim PhD
I don't play that many games on my phone or tablet but I didn't want to ignore this just because I don't game so I decided to check it out
I picked it up anyway and I've been using it a lot and turns out when you take away a lot of the gaming features and a lot of the stuff that it's really good at for gaming it just becomes an 8 inch pure Android sort of a Nexus 8 kind of tablet
so it's packing
it's pretty compact
it's got a pretty solid weight to it a bit heavier than the Nexus 7 and just small enough that I can hold it with one hand although I guess most people will two-handed since it is bigger than the Nexus 7 but I gotta say the build quality is pretty decent again
I probably said this when talking about just about every device with this but it really should be standard especially in tablets where you have all this space to work with
but there's still miles better sounding than anything else with back facing speakers and you got to love that for media and of course you can see inside that left speaker
it has a 5 megapixel front facing camera and a 5 megapixel rear facing camera both of which are actually pretty good quality but I don't think you should be using them much anyway so really my only complaint well with the shield hardware is just the buttons the power and volume buttons
they're pretty awful
so they're a pain to use and I've been using this tablet for weeks and I still can't even change the volume without picking up the tablet and looking at it so the buttons are my only gripe so anyway this tablet is clearly meant for gaming and I almost feel bad not talking about all these gaming features because they're totally badass
there's a wireless controller
I said I'm not a gamer and I wouldn't know best about that so I'm actually going to leave a link or two repla the like button to videos that do a good job of showcasing these gaming features but for me this is an Android 4.4
and not only
but because it's stock
and the k1 really shows off your even when you're just doing regular multitasking or web browsing it's not a super high resolution display so you're not pushing a ton of pixels
it's a 1080p
eight inch display
it's just it's really about showing off the Nvidia k1 and it's just killing it and just to make sure it wasn't just me giving stock Android too much credit
a very old app
Android tablet that I can showcase this app on and it doesn't lag and stutter and crash so I guess it's kind of crazy that Google or has remained a benchmark for so long so yeah with this awesome graphical performance since Nvidia is doing such a good job with that of course using a tablet with general everyday use is very smooth
you get fast performance
there are a few additions and Vidya has thrown in again mostly for gaming but some of the stuff is pretty cool one of them and I guess this is the most major is the stylus
something you won't find on a nexus but it is a pretty advanced stylus so when you remove it you get a couple of stylus ready apps you can choose to launch and the really impressive one here is an Nvidia dabbler
it's awesome
okay another thing
I didn't look behind the scenes at what it was doing to the CPU but again the main purpose to show off to the NVIDIA k1 so they added those modes to be able to change
you might have added but again probably an videos dedicated shield wireless controller for gaming because all these features are for gaming and all the stuff is built right into Android settings so very conveniently tucked away where you know you can find them when you want to look for them
Android 4.4 is immersion mode but full-time for the entire operating system like on demand so I guess if you just hate seeing the notifications or you just need a force the full screen game to happen you can do that so yeah really
this tablet is full-featured
it's packed it's legit
I've enjoyed using it over the Nexus 7 mostly for the front-facing speakers because again I love hearing a sound to move across your face as the image moves across the screen
that kind of stuff
you just can't get with rear-facing speakers and it makes media so much better and tablets are really all about media if you're gaming or watching a video or whatever you're doing and you know if you're going to look for the software updates over in Nexus I have faith because the Nvidia shield the og shield actually got quite a few updates on the software department
Nvidia keep it up
last week
I've been driving my tuned car around for a week now so I think I have a pretty good grasp of what the tune does to the car so today
I'm gonna talk about the things that I like and the things I don't like and ultimately whether or not I think that this is a good purchase so without further ado let's get started first up
you're gonna feel a lot more push from your car than it did before but keep in mind tuning your car with an open flash tablet or with any tune for that matter isn't gonna make your FRS 86 B or Z
this thing does add more power but I think more specifically a better way of saying it is that it flattens out the torque curve so the more rpms that you build the faster your car's gonna feel and to me that's changed the dynamic of driving so much
flash tablets strongest point
flash tablet costs $500 and at $500 brand new the open flash tablet is already cheaper than an ECU tech option for some contexts before I actually went out and bought this thing I contact with delicious tuning for a quote and they gave me a quote of six hundred and seventy five dollars for their Flash tune and it broke it down to three hundred
things are insanely good
that means the idle stays consistently at around 800 to 700 rpm even when you turn the AC my car had this weird thing where when you turn on the air conditioning the RPMs would fluctuate and the car would feel like
so if you're a fan of the loud cold start you might want to contact the open flash team and maybe they can work something out with you but now with all that said all the things
I don't really mind because I picked mine up used for $350 but if I had bought one brand new for $500 and it felt the way it was I would have been disappointed
the second thing
is that you really can't do much on the actual tablet itself for example if you wanted to edit your launch control and you want to change the rpm at which it launched at you have to plug your tablet into your computer
and then go
and edit that tune file with another piece of software on that you find online and then ultimately to find out which aspects to edit and it's just complete just a nightmare so in my head a tablet is supposed to be mobile and convened but the fact that you can't even edit your launch control on this tablet let alone your car
it's really just lazy
since you can't edit any of the files directly on here you have to plug it into your computer and the process is not any easier on the computer before you're able to do anything with your open flash tablet you have to plug it into your computer and either download something called the open flash manager now
that's 14 years ago
don't be fooled because this is definitely not user friendly at least not when it's your first time ever using it without any prior knowledge with all that said would
your car will still feel the same way if you tune it with this or if you tune it with a newer one so being able to save $200 why wouldn't you but that's just my opinion on it
do you guys have local tuners in your area that maybe offer a better package than the open flash and are you guys currently interested in the open flash or do you actually have an open flash yourself let me know in the comments below
thanks for watching
i used to animate and give you some general animation tips such as how i animate gradients since some people were wondering but first let's take a look at the tablet the tablet
that was just released
what goes into animating
that will be animated
it's usually a good idea to at least sketch a bit of what you want your background to look like as well so that you can catch any compositional errors before you spend 30 hours animating something
circular motions make things look more natural since things rarely move in a straight line in real life this little cheek could be applied in a lot of different ways from head movements to walk cycles to well whatever you want
some people might want their sketches to be as clean and consistent as possible before they start to add line art and some people might just be comfortable lining what they have personally
considering how long animation takes of course this also depends on whether or not what you're working on is a personal project or if it's something more professional while i'm lining all of this i'm going to go ahead and real quick talk about the tablet
then you've got all sorts of combinations you can do with your shortcuts to make drawings so much faster the only downside is if you don't already know all of your program's shortcuts
so if you think you'd like something more simple i have another tablet review up which i'll link in the description for anyone who wants to check that out back to the tutorial at this point i've lined all of the frames but i'll give you some line art tips quick before i talk about color when you're lining an animation
keep your onion skins tool on so that you can make sure that your lines are where they need to be as long as you keep each line in between the lines from the surrounding frames
i also recommend you turn on the line smoothing tool i keep mine on a lower setting so it doesn't slow me down too much but your lines will definitely look better with it on also if you can try to make sure there's no gaps in between the outside edges of your line art so that you can use the select and fill tool later on for faster coloring after you've got your line art done it's time to color
add a new layer below the line art and use the select tool to select the inside of your figure and fill it but wait if you select it normally and try to color it
we do not want that to avoid this in the tool settings for the select tool you can choose to make the selection one or two pixels bigger alternatively you can grow the selection from the selection drop down menu this way when you select the selection will appear a bit bigger and there won't be a gap then you can use the fill tool to fill in your selection with whatever colors your character is if you want to spend the extra time to add some gradients
here's how i animate gradients in my animations on a new layer color where you want your gradient to be and then use the same gradient on similar frames while moving it slightly to match your character's motions then select your figure
that's on the outside or at least that's how i animate gradients though if you can avoid animated ingredients you probably should because it takes a lot of extra time
if you have the time you'd be surprised how much you can learn just from youtube tutorials but anyway as always thank you so much for watching thanks for all of your support and have a nice day bye you
inc graphics tablet
it's all black
everything's all really nice
you've got lots of extra nibs in there as well and also you get another bag full of nibs as well and another thing which is amazing it comes in its little pouch as well which is magnetic so that is brilliant it comes with lots of good accessories and the tablet itself is here and the tablet is brilliant
i'm just going to quickly show you how to do a little bit of um drawing with it so you get your pen and you hold it just a little bit above the surface of the tablet and as you can see on the screen your mouse goes around
the cursor goes around the screen and if we go down to here just click once and then we go to the tablet and yes of course and we can go to the um just the application that comes with the uh this is the software that comes with the tablet and you can program it you crop
i suppose
no i'm in this
oh well let me go to press keys and then you can program any of these buttons here to do anything you like so if you just double click on it um oh we don't double click
you can windows
let's go there
and he's filling in no okay so then we'll get back to the keep on forgetting which one it is so we want that one and then that one yep and let's get let's get the black again and then let's do that and that put that that bit that bit a bit
yep okay
there's a gap there
obviously you can tell it's goofy can't you so okay for some reason it wouldn't let me okay yet but i've done it and let's fill that there we go there
we have a goofy
that's not too bad
there's my goofy
i mean i'm a rubbish drawer as you can see but it's um it's quite quick how quickly you can draw a well-known cartoon character and i actually see you can actually see what character it is
i think that you'd call that so you can pretty much draw whatever you like or just angle that so you can see it a bit better so you can draw whatever you like and then press that button deletes everything on the screen but obviously you got no color on this one i think so you can just do whatever you like
it fills up
and that's it so you just practice on that one but unfortunately you can't shave unfortunately you can't save to the to the screen which is a bit of a shame
that's it okay
uh video
oh product that
I'm going to review for you guys after the projector and the recently released s8 tab so this one's slightly bigger s10 name 10 inches in size and as usual
so you don't have to use a micro USB anymore in 2020 if you want to charge the tab itself so let's go look at the device itself and see what's going on in here so on the front we've got the 2 megapixel camera and on the bottom
C charging port
we've got the 20
80 by 720 screen
so if you're planning on giving the tablet and to your kids you can set up parental controls with for example timings with what access they've got and so on so on and then moving forward we've got the storage so like I did mention 32 gigabytes of internal storage
then oh there are some duplicates for example and then in terms of security in location we can set up a screen lock with a pattern swipe pin code or password again just to keep our device secure if it's lost for example when it comes to navigation bar and actually yeah the navigation bar if you'd like you can set it so you hide it so it's not always there obviously it will automatically hide when you try and watch a video but if not it will be permanently on the bottom you can change the arrangements of the buttons as well
so even though it's a 10-inch tablet you can still obviously up just the the size of everything the whole screen or just for example the font itself and then pretty much bluetooth for points to Wi-Fi no NFC not really something you would use on a 10 inch tab anyway for Google pay or anything line and then when it comes to homescreen it's quite customizable so you've got the app drawer if you've seen and then you've got the Google now to the far left but if you'd like to you can obviously turn that off so let's go to home settings and then we've got the show Google Apps or the one on the far left you can obviously turn that off if you'd like to and then you can change even change the icons shapes then you can do pulldown action so whatever you pull down on the screen it will then and access the notification panel from the top if you want you can do it single style so there is no app drawer from the bottom or you can change the to dual layer which means that you've got the app drawer on the bottom when you slide from the bottom and then if you'd like to you can also arrange rearrange the grid so how many icons you want on every page when it comes to software pre-installed as this with Vonk your products there is no bloatware you do get pretty much basic Android stuff which is nice because you don't have to uninstall anything so I've installed Netflix Spotify and basically that's pretty much it everything else comes pre-installed what you need oh sorry
I also downloaded word because I want to show you a neat feature in a second and then we've got the two cameras like I did mention so we've got a two megapixel camera on the front in terms of quality
there's not really much to say you can do zoom videos if you want to you can use Skype if you want to and then you've got the HDR mode and you even get gridlines so if you want to use that
and it works
it works with conferences in obviously not gonna make any any any pretty pictures we've got but it's there if you need to and then because it is an Android device obviously it also supports bluetooth keyboards and nice
Amazon and you can fully use it as maybe not a laptop replacement but if you need to need to do a word document or anything like that create a word documents you can do that easily
it's a full-blown
Excel spreadsheets on it
I have to admit I'm pretty impressed especially with lack of any bloatware because obviously you don't have to uninstall anything which means it just works really nice fast fluid and you don't have to do anything to to kind of improve the performance of the device itself so if you'd like to know which keyboard
is the battery life you're looking at 6,000 milliampere hour battery however because of the 720p screen and to be honest quite a power efficient processor it is some sort of a quad-core CPU
the HD 8 is an 8 inch tablet while the 10 is 10.1 inches when it comes to resolution the HD 8 is a hundred and eighty nine PPI which is 1280 by 800 while the ten is 224 PPI and that's 1920 by 1200 storage is also different the HD 8 had 16 and 32 gigs of storage
the HD 8 had a 2 megapixel front facing camera and a 2 megapixel rear-facing camera with 720p HD video recording capability now the Fire HD 10 has a VGA front-facing camera and a 2 megapixel rear camera along with 720p HD video recording there's more RAM and there's a more powerful processor in the Fire HD 10 here battery life though between the 8 and the 10 is about the same you'll get about 10 hours on both some have complained that the fire tablets are laggy so I compared the 10 and the 8 to my Apple iPad pro just to see how long it takes to open apps on each of them you can head over to tech gadgets
I liked the experience and found it to be quite a good budget tablet even so it did have some serious limitations particularly compared to our America cousin's experience for starters Alexa functionality wasn't ready or functioning then and the popular show mode option in which the Alexa voice responses are enhanced with
this is definitely disappointing
you get kind of a stereo effect and the voices are pretty clear when it comes to music you can hear it okay using the built-in speakers but I think you're losing a lot of the quality
music sounds a bit tinny and the bass not surprisingly is minimal even so sound quality overall is good for a tablet of this size and at this price point the video quality here is also pretty good and definitely improved from the fire eight the resolution as noted earlier is obviously better but does that translate into a better viewing experience
I'd say yes
Maps contacts calendars
Doc's weather and more if you want the functionality of a small tablet computer this device definitely puts it all right in front of you of course a big draw will also be the Kindle app for reading books
once you're signed in you'll have access to your full library without having to go hunting for them all over again the Amazon App Store comes loaded onto the tablet so you can download other apps you might want
I still think this is one of the best budget tablets out there if you need a tablet but can't swallow the price of something like an Apple iPad or Samsung Amazon's tablets will definitely give you what you need in a wallet
friendly form the Fire HD 10 is a definite improvement on the eight but when it comes to price you have a question to ask yourself are marginal improvements in speed and resolution worth another hundred bucks the Fire HD eight starts at $99 and the Fire HD 10 starts at $1.99

Cintiq tablet now
that doesn't come with
Windows or anything pre-installed
this is like a second monitor that you plug in to your Mac or your PC that you can draw on using the included pen it's got full HD resolution 1920 by 1080 stylus has 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity like I said before this is very comparable to the 13 inch Wacom Cintiq 13 HD fact
it looks like the
doing cheaper tablets
I think the price reflects that it comes in somewhere in between the really cheap tablets and the high-end Wacom stuff but they're trying to match the Wacom quality so before I dive in too deep full confession
too one thing
they feel cheap
I've gotten used to using like on-screen touch buttons with the surface but often you'll miss them or they won't stay pressed or your thumb will slide off or you have to actually look at it when you're pressing it but with a tactile button you just know it's there because you can feel it now
I mapped it to zoom and I mapped it in order to change my brush sizes but it does all sorts of different things like scrolling through layers or moving up and down in your document
you can change it around as you like and one of the bottlenecks on the surface at least for me was changing brush sizes because I had to go up to the little slider in the corner and change it
Wacom tablets
which gives you a little bit of texture when you're drawing it's not as smooth and slick as the glass screens that you'll see on an iPad or a surface
that's a good thing
I got really really good thin lines when I pressed lightly and I got really great thick lines as I applied more pressure and like many other things on this tablet
the stylus also comes with this cool little case and the case is filled with a boatload of nibs to small-boat another thing that has kind of plagued a lot of the devices
I've used in
though is the stand
the stand is rock-solid if you can set it it pretty much any that you needed to be at in fact if you want you could set it all the way up and use it like an extra monitor and that's where the quality of the screen comes in because it really works well as an extra monitor but can it withstand the heaviness of my fist
I spend most of my time drawing on the Mac but I did spend a little bit of time in Windows just fiddling around with it and try it out but I would definitely say most of my time spent on it was on a Mac just for kicks
I didn't need it to work with the surface tablet I also saw in the forums that you probably want to uninstall any other tablet drivers that you already have installed before installing this
I did notice it a tiny bit in Photoshop but that was the only other one they gave me some beta drivers to download and play with and that seemed to fix the problem for me
also I'm a snob everything I've used in the last couple years has a Retina screen so I'm not used to seeing pixels but at the same time you're saving a lot of money so I think it's a worthy trade-off another little thing is that the iPad screen and the surface screen

you obviously get the uh veek tablet itself you get two little bags really generous amount of pen tips here so you get a little bag with some extra pen tips in and then you get another bag with absolutely loads of pen tips in and this also contains a little tool to help you with replacing the pen
tips or nibs
i was surprised
in addition to that you get a little felt case for the pen but you also get a second pen in a second case so you get a spare one as well very very cool indeed then we get a little polishing cloth that we can keep this looking nice and then we also get a little glove to glide across the surface nicely and then a couple of cables
you get this hdmi cable and then you also get a power cable which is also got usb c as well so two usbs one to connect your computer one for extra power and then also usb c on this end to go into the tablet itself so to give you a quick guide around the vk 1200 on the base
we've got this plastic backing and some rubberized feet to keep it nice and firmly on the desk and if we take a look around on this side here we have got the ports for the usbc and also the hdmi cable
we've of course got the drawing surface quite a nice border somewhere to rest your hand and then also some express keys down this side as well so we've now got this set up and running
it's connected via the usb cable to my mac pro and also the uh hdmi cable was going to the mac pro as well so this is now acting as like a secondary display
now i've note
so it's a nice compact display it's 11.6 inches and the resolution is 1920x1080 and this is actually an ips display as well that's equivalent of 5080 lines per inch
the pressure sensitivity is 8192 levels and it has to be roughly about 10 millimeters from the surface for it to register the icon and allow you to control or register the pointer and allow you to control the computer worth noting
this is pressure sensitive so when you are drawing on your image you can get very thin lines the jitter on this is very very minimal as well allows you to get nice smooth lines and then of course because of the pressure sensitivity if i start very lightly and then push harder then of course as long as you've got this enabled within your application
you can of course draw very thin lines and then go up to thicker lines as well and you can adjust the source start point and end point of the pressure sensitivity and thickness and flow of the brush
1200 display now
being able to draw directly onto the image gives you just so much more control it feels so much more natural very very good for both design for marking things up for masking etc
it looks absolutely fantastic
and what
there is some sort of fiddling when you have to set this up so you install the drive you have to give various permissions as long as you follow the guide
thanks for watching
hi everyone so
I looked for whenever I was thinking about buying this but couldn't find anything that really fit the bill exactly while this tablet is often used for a game called osoo or OSU
I've never played it and I probably won't but can't give you any information on it but I guess this tablet was actually designed to use with that game but I wanted to use this tablet as a portable art tablet which they do say that it can be used for art and I know artists that use it so I know it works so I'm going to go into the details and tell you how well the same performs with creating art first things first
cheaper called the hue on 420 the only difference between the 420 and the H 420 is the lack of three programmable buttons on the side of the 420 figured having more than just two buttons on the pen for an extra five bucks was kind of worth it
I said it's tiny
how any the buttons as tablet surprised me by having 2048 levels of pressure just like most of accom tablets on the market the LPI or lines per inch is at a rather high 4000 while higher in tablets stick around five thousand to five thousand a TLP I next is the pen it's powered by one triple-a battery with no eraser on the opposing end
the pen also has two buttons on the side of the barrel which are fully programmable via the driver typically is that these buttons is undo and redo to turn the pen on you can click the end of it the same as you would with a basic thing pin and click it out to turn it off so as far as I know it doesn't have a power saving mode so remember to turn it off or you will waste your battery and if on this thing is a little different from your common ups
it is replaceable
it's a detachable me
Mac OSX tuna
no you absolutely must turn off the pen and touch settings on the PCs even the driver manual says to turn it off although it didn't seem to how much whenever I tried it on Windows 7 and I've never tested this on 8 so I'm sorry to say but I have no idea what that driver will act
I'm using paint tool
Sai and it seems to run smoothly though due to its size I find it difficult to make fluid sketches this could be remedied by practicing with the H 420
I felt like I wanted to add something to the grip to be able to hold it easier but that would hinder using the two buttons sighs so I just endured back whenever I had first purchased this tablet I tried it on my Mac with a 27-inch screen
losing the cursor
just say please so the smaller your screen the better it fits up this tablet of course zooming in always helps also on the Mac that each per 20 seemed to work alright with Photoshop well the PC the version of Photoshop doesn't seem to recognize that
Photoshop is iffy
it is cheap though
$30.00 is amazing
I have no idea
what's up everybody so it has been a while since i have done my last tablet review um the last one was the deco pro and the deco 3 if i remember correctly and that was sometime last year um this year starting fresh
i'm releasing this
they reached out to me a few weeks ago and they asked me if i would kindly give them my honest opinion and make a video with an honest review so disclaimer
they're great and they're great for a budget option but a lot of where they fall and lack is i think in driver support and build quality these guys nail both and they're really targeting the professional and um higher end user class to go against wacom and honestly it comes in a little bit cheaper so i think they're a happy medium from both budget and professional quality
but i'm gonna get into the video with you guys and i'm gonna let you guys decide from what you see um but again if you guys enjoy this type of content and want me to make any more video reviews or product reviews
please leave a like and comment below and also don't forget to hit that subscribe button and turn on the bell notification for any videos that i come that i upload in the future so anyways i hope you guys enjoy
uh feeling fabric
you also get two different sets of nibs in there which most alternatives only get one style you get a wireless usb a dongle so you can work wirelessly and then you also have a usb a to usb c converter in there as far as the tablet itself is high grade quality material
on the back side we have the power switch with some light indicators to show you that power is on and then you have a usbc port for charging and for any of those that need security like a school or a development studio
i'm a linux user so this is a huge thing for me to actually have a proper uh gui interface for my linux drivers that actually works xp pen kinda has something similar but is nowhere near at this quality level and that actually works consistently
and i i give them mad props for making sure that they're taking care of everybody not just windows and mac like most tablet companies and you have full customization from pen pressure
and you can switch your monitors and and there's a lot of things that you can do in here and i think it's really really great what they're doing and just really showcase what type of professional level that they're trying to achieve uh with with each other their tablets so the drone experience on this tablet is great
labs medium tablet
so i'm basically just going to be using the artist 15.6 pro as a second monitor for references and stuff and then i'm going to be using the sense lab as my main workhorse now before i get into pricing
it's awesome
so i'm hoping to get a review copy of that and sharing that with you guys because if like i said if this is going to be their first attempt at just a regular tablet the wacom is going to have to wake up and and make some interesting innovations in their technology if they want to keep up with you know the pricing model that they have senslab is a professional level tablet premium grade quality uh components and i love this thing
um so if you guys can't afford it the pricing on this is 279.99 and then there's another bundle with a shortcut remote which they were going to send it to me
i don't know if they're still sending me the shortcut remote but if they do i'll do a quick uh review on that as well but that version with the shortcut remote is 359.99 for beginner artists
you have the other alternatives out there to start your artistic journey but for anybody who is i would say a student coming out and getting ready to come out of college and need a solid piece of technology to last them for their first you know decade of work in the industry or a professional that you know their wacom might have bunked out on them and now they finally need a replacement
it comes in lower
it's premium grade material
that's the company
if you have any questions or comments that you you you want to leave on the video or about the tablet leave them in the comment section below again please
i picked this one particularly after my own research as being an ideal and very affordable tablet to add to my sim racing setup however this will be a conventional review largely not specifically targeted for sim racers
so no guarantee on that as i don't know at this point but if i do manage to secure a discount code i will post that directly next to the product link on paper
the tablet has a usb type-c socket on the side so we have a relevant charging cable for that plus an eu type plug-in charging adapter us customers will be supplied a different charging adapter suitable for them
i was also sent a uk conversion plug that's included when you buy the tablet if you are in the uk and finally a printed fold-out manual and warranty card so all the stuff you would expect
it's pretty standard stuff
uh past the usual security check when you add a new device to your account and you have the opportunity to install installed apps that you have on another device so basically exactly the same setup steps as with all android devices when you turn them on for the first time
the tablet runs stock android 9 without any added bloatware which many people will be happy to see including myself and there are no special added ui elements it's just android with all the usual settings and features which are familiar to android users
how can i fully demonstrate to you how well the teclast p80x tablet worked for me during my time using it and my solution was to simply show you different apps
i did not have a suitable sized sim card to test the tablet as a mobile phone and that also means i wasn't able to test performance using mobile data so do understand the tech class
but personally i'm not able to show you this in this video but i'm sure there are other reviews out there for this product that does have this information with the benchmark complete
well you could try running geekbench on your own mobile phone or an existing tablet you have and that will give you a baseline understanding of performance comparing your own devices to the p80x if we check our results against the geekbench database we can see where this device sits in the list first
let's take a look at the single core performance and now multi-core performance and the results are not too shabby we're sitting alongside some well-respected branded phones and tablets next
using the tablet next some web browsing and no issues to report navigating pages was fast and smooth clicking links opens new pages quite quickly so all in all a pleasant web browsing experience the 8 inch screen and 1280 by 800 pixel ips display provides perfectly sufficient real estate for reading pages clearly with great viewing angles because of that ips screen
don't forget use the timestamps to navigate through the rest of the video as i've purposely made the test footage long beyond my commentary so you can get a good impression of what this tablet is like to use on to video streaming
i'm not going to show you any commercial movie footage here but i can show you something using the youtube app by other people which may not be suitable for all that down to the reprojection cancelling out any benefits of this higher refresh rate
that's pretty robust
that seems very very short-sighted as there's absolutely no reason why this shouldn't work with other driving get really so i must say thank you to anthony for making the plug-in cheers man
there is a box of monster munch on its way i've actually owned my m-spec shift lights for over three and a half years but it's just been in the draw since i haven't used eye racing since that time
come on you completed
get his weapon
soon find the generator
not don't forget
go to the generator
it's not very good to be honest producing a grainy image in my slightly dimly lit room in the evening being a budget tablet money saved on having basic cameras has gone elsewhere into better parts
such as the octa core processor which we've seen has no problem running all those demanding games and this is where the android tablet is living these days as a permanent fixture on my sim racing setup
of course
there is a 3.5
should give you three to four hours of gaming and up to 10 hours of video playback so typical performance there which is fine all said and done this tablet packs in a lot of power and features for its price point and it doesn't lack in build quality either
it's great value for money so i have no problem telling you to check this tablet out if you are shopping for a budget tablet option most definitely add it to your list of potential options as it is worth considering
Sony my favorite brand and I'm gonna have a press conference on Monday 830 central european time and they have not told anyone really what they're going to talk about so there's a lot of rumors and a lot of speculation and people are saying that hmm they just released the set 5 flagship phone in the u.s. it was announced six months ago in
SmartWatch maybe they're going to talk about playstation vr or perhaps it's time to release another tablet and speaking of tablets one year ago exactly plus minus couple of days
this was announced
and i thought was time to tell you why partly because this might be superseded on monday buy a new tablet and partly because there is another ruling rumor flying around saying that sony will get out of the tablet market altogether which seems strange because they are very good at making good tablets
probably someone else once said that an engineer doesn't know that he's done with his work when he can't add more to the design but when he can't take anything else away from the design and I think the Sony the Sony design engineers
you have a camera
you have some dents here where i've been using this i've been using this extensively for the past eight months and there's a bit of scratching here the back in fact everything except the front is made out of plastic
so but you know nothing much to see here if you take a look at it from the front again you will notice that the only thing you can really see on the outside here
it's the power button
and in here you can find that you can insert a micro SD card and also a possibly a nano-sim if you have the cell version of this tablet which I don't I have the Wi-Fi only version
of course
you have the micro
rocker is painted black
indeed there are speakers but you can't really see them because they are here is one and here is one and they are just tiny little slits in the glass that covers the whole front
which gives you it
there is if we turn this on quite a bit of bezel around the edges here turns out though that if you want to hold this the vessel is actually a very nice size
I think it is possibly because if you hold it like this your hand will cup the speakers and that might actually improve the sound but if your hands are big like mine you will just cover the speakers
Glaus is a fraction of a millimeter above the surface which means that it doesn't scratches easily and also it makes it tiny bit easier to hold with one hand because you kind of got that lip to to rest your thumb against which is very nice other things to say about this is of course the physical characteristics it is very thin and it is very light
I don't know how much that is in ounces or pounds but it is very light it is quite easy to handle with one hand and it is very very thin and here
because i don't really read them but these nice to have it in my bag and if i put these side by side i don't know if you can see that they are basically almost the same thickness
listen to music
I promise you alright so we too can take a look at the outside of this and now a couple of you know technical words about the insides on the front as you can see or you can see the the main screen of the screen
Sony's TV marketing
department can't really say what it is all about but if you go into you know every Griffin's videos I'm sure that she will explain it in detail somewhere I really like the display 10.1
that's the hottest thing last year basically and it's not really that interesting anymore because now everyone has talked about the end 820 the Snapdragon 810 had a very bad reputation when it was released as it was constantly overheating
it is a quad
it is pretty quick
there are three gigs of ram in this computer of this tablet which means that you can play games like XCOM which you can't play on smaller tablet or tablets with less memory so this is one of the games
I play when I'm traveling because you can play this for days without finishing it and it's really a good game just came out the ExCom to just came out
we go obviously
the point is
I wanted to show that although this tablet is actually getting on a bit it can still handle modern games and even these games that weren't really made for the tablet
these were is a pc game that i've converted let's exit and played a couple of other games when I was trying to compare this to the whip to the shield tablet k 1
Croft go
the thing is this is a very good game for using on a tablet it really uses all the the complete screen size very well and it's also interesting game to play of course
this really is all
guess that's where the SOC is but otherwise it's okay you perhaps slightly easier this time because I'm actually know what I'm supposed to do nice Kapoor jay chou what what's up thanks hasta
baby what do we have here so if you take a look at this tablet the Sony Xperia said for tablet and there I mean telling you about the design and the software and the screen and everything you can't I can't this
they can upgrade the soc to 820 and Snapdragon 820 and they could up the ram a bit they could introduce more onboard memory built in in memory till maybe 128 gigs of storage or something like that they could possibly add a fingerprint scanner or maybe a USB type-c instead of the microUSB they could of course also improve the cameras because these cameras aren't very good the problem is if I was something which I'm not but if I was and I was following this only balanced design philosophy
I would really struggle to figure out what to do with this tablet to improve it because if you take a look at it this you can't really take anything else away
you can make the vessels smaller but then you would kind of leave people with no where to place their thumb so they can't hold it they could fiddle with the placement of the speakers possibly but hmm
Snapdragon to the a20
simple very utilitarian
for android it's minimal
Android and just keep the things that people actually think are improvements over standard which they're done very well and eventually they will come to a point where they can't really do much more in the only balance scheme of things they kind of come to the end of the road so they can upgrade this slightly which will mean that they end up with kind of water had last year when they wanted to release the said for phone but ended up releasing the scent 3 plus in everywhere except in Japan
three phone already was was very slight improvements on the chipset and they in a no ram improvement of anything else and that simply wasn't a big enough step to warrant a calling it the new flagship
it would just be an update and people will not think that it's worth the upgrade so for Sony at this point they really need to come up with something new
you know power button the run round silly little button that you have on all the previous said devices experience at devices and made it elongated and flat and not very comfortable and also
that didn't quite work
and it's impressive
I've spoken to seem to just hate and they put skins on it to to get rid of that reflect surface although I must admit that most people have been talking to our men and so there might be a difference gender wise
I don't know so if I was a designer and Sony I would really be pulling my hair out at the moment because whatever they do to this whatever they add they gonna make it worse so if they want to come out with a new tablets or phone and you brand new flagship
and then they gotta regroup rethink and come back with something different that's my guess and I go in two days I might find out until then I do recommend if you got to buy a new tablet and do take a look at the cell phone tablet
it is very good
that's too bad
it doesn't matter if it's a sony or samsung or an LG or HTC or Hawaii or whatever it is and it's you don't really get that much more when you upgrade your tablet which is why the tablets market is is slowing down
xperia set for tablet
so it's a remake of an old game love that and also xcom enemy within both are games that have been ported from the pc and the Grim Fandango is kind of a point-and-click adventure game which was very popular in the 90s
I really love them
but you don't have to dumb it down like the deep with a civilization revolution which is just an awful awful game if people start making games like that if people start making semi-serious apps that you could actually do some semi serious productive work with if we could get Android to become truly multitasking and get you know switching between apps and programs then I think tablets would be again selling like hotcakes and also it would be worth your money to upgrade your tablet or indeed your phone even if this just you know some extra ram or new chipset because that would make those demanding programs run better
the situation now is that almost all developers are developing games and thank things and they're kind of giving them away for free and then they are making the money on ads and and in-app purchases which means that they need to get it out to as many devices as possible and if you want to get things out and with medical devices as possible you have to make them run well on
even you know low end or at least mid-level devices and if you can run your apps and your games and everything you do on a entry-level device that cost maybe a third or what you have to pay for this
Sony for instance it might be a good idea to get some of those PlayStation titles converted for the tablet or possibly preferably multiply station titles directly but rather pc games
make sure that you get some of the more advanced pc games converted to to this platform and I think that would get the hardware up and running again from being basically you know not very interesting anymore
so that's why
but for everyone else
then you can start selling upgrades again like you did to the PC and the 3d gaming wars in the early late 90s and early 2000s where you had to buy a new graphics card every eight months or so to just play the new games that came out and we need that kind of situation to get the hardware really steaming again
well it has what happened with that on day one we had this shipped to Canada and when it hit the border not only did it sit there forever to clear it was valued at over six thousand seven hundred and eighty dollars as a kind of a mess up on Canada Post declaration the guy typed in and wrong because it's forty nine ninety nine American so we had it sent back reassessed and now it's valued at forty nine ninety nine American so it caught
check it out
it looks pretty normal
nothing on the bottom
you know the latest and greatest games and running all your apps so we're going to focus on what this actually is on a nuke level because they haven't made a nuke device since the nuke HD in the Nook HD Plus and that's been a long time because the last two have been Samsung devices
anything like that
you can find various audiobooks priced from anywhere from like $1 all the way up to like $30 depending on the book if it's James Patterson it's going to be a couple bucks if it's some guy I've never heard of gonna be like you know five dollars but you can press the little play button here if you want to hear the preview okay
I'll read along with you and all that kind of stuff if you click Barnes & Noble what this does is just a redirect to the Barnes & Noble page
it just it
it's a tablet
so really cool
don't rip the paper
oh this one sorry
you can also share this stuff on social media platforms like hangouts send to your Google keep and so forth next thing we're going to look at is we'll just go down
the new caps current read is your thing you're currently reading so it'll just pop back over to that note home isn't like a redirect to the to the home page
of course
there's shops apartment
Auto and motorcycles and all that other stuff it'll look like that clicking on a book everything kind of shows up on one page and it Scrolls all the way so
you see you see the the the cover page with the cover page behind it expanded and blurred to give you that depth then it just fades away and the logo and the the name comes up too
and it's very intuitive
Barnes & Noble
read out
so you can go to topics and click your topics and then you can read out your pics and other people's pics and all that kind of stuff and just you know endlessly
scroll through things but it's really cool because it just gives you a little preview and then you can click read more or read article and that will send you to the respective article you can also like it and share on social media platforms like you can with most of the other things that's all for the actual
I said you can click the middle Hank and you get a scroller kind of visual table of contents and then I think they said something you can zoom out
I think Coors Light you would click on that but this way you can see it so if you wanted to look at my really interesting celebrity stuff until I chose this but can we have something other than a here
we go some sunglasses
it's it's pretty good
I mean it's got a 3000 milliamp battery which I personally love because a lot of people just focus on what this thing looks like and not what it actually can do
we're like wow
it's like you know
I guess lately it's more about like the software experience and what the OS and the UI and the user interface can do for you rather than the actual hardware itself because all tablets look the same
quad core dual cameras
puzzles are fantastic
a pin display tablet
it's comfortable to use because you can draw directly on the screen as if you're drawing on paper the cool thing about this is that allows you to use your professional favorite program directly on your computer without the limitation of an app on the iPad for example
you know when it comes to those programs you don't have any limitation when it comes to the size of your file or the number of the layers that you want to use so that's great this model as a fifteen point six inches working area which is big enough
you need to watch the back of the stand to change the angle so you need to be very careful because the tablet could slip and fall because it almost happened to me and that was scary so be very careful on the tablet
it's very nice
I noticed that it's getting looser over time but I'm always afraid to drop the tablet when I try to take it out from there because it's quite tight and I used too much strength so I'm afraid that it might fall because of that
maybe it's too soft
it's basically an only one cable that have the HDMI cable they use be cabled platt cable and the USBC cable only one and the only cable you have to connect to the tablet is the USBC one and it has a very nice design because it's like angular so it doesn't stick out when you connect it
it's very nice
it's a cool touch
when the tablet's on underneath it there are two keys with which you can adjust straightaway the practice of the tablet but to get us to the full menu settings of the tablet
dial by default has three modes that you can change by pressing the key in the middle one makes you 2 min and out one makes you change the size of the brush
it's amazing unfortunately
what you saw
the government has them reviewed as you can see this new one is very sleek and you can definitely tell that this has eliminated screen because it looks less grey
I think this could be for you so as always I made a drawing with this tablet and I just wanted to experiment a little bit with my style this time
I don't know if it was a good choice though because I don't really like the result but it's fine as part of the process to get where I want to be
I'm using right now
can you believe that
the light source
it's so unclear and
not gonna lie
this is not how
I imagined it in my head definitely also I was trying to push proportions so I made the hands pretty big but it doesn't look like I made it on purpose in it looks like I know nothing about a man Anatomy
let's be honest
it's a very foggy
I've never started
I always forget everything
I feel like I was quite good and now I just don't even know how to paint digitally anymore it's overwhelming but I can always learn it again and remember to practice it more so that I won't forget about it anyway guys
srt-6 kay tires now
they offer an easy affordable and reliable tuning solution for the BRZ the open flash tablet is a handheld standalone tuning device for the Scion fr-s and Subaru BRZ platform the tablet plugs into the obd2 port and performs a variety of functions from storing and loading off-the-shelf and custom tunes to data logging and monitoring driving performance
also we like that
visit the tablet is pretty intuitive to use menus are all clearly marked with their functions and navigating through the device is relatively straightforward the first time you plug it into your car's obd2 port you'll need to select your vehicle marry the oft to your car and save your stock tuning to the device
our tablet came preloaded with five different off-the-shelf Tunes including a stage one 91 octane tune to stage 2 tunes for aftermarket headers equal length and unequal length and another two stage two Tunes for a 85 again for unequal length and equal length
this is a welcome change as the BRZ fa20 motor has never really been praised for its smoothness after a couple hundred miles this tune really starts to come into its own
we were pleasantly surprised
PRC's power delivery feels those noticeable increase in torque all throughout the rev range but especially in the mid to lower rpms the engine also seems to be smoother between shifts the oft stage one tune definitely provides a smoother and higher horsepower
driving experience
the increase in power makes this car a lot more fun to drive with a more linear power band the BRZ really begins to feel like the great sports car that it is passing on the highway
the only audible difference
we noticed after a few miles on the tune was an increase in engine tone around 4000 rpm where there used to be a significant torque dip that torqued up hasn't disappeared entirely
all right bonding 85
we couldn't wait to see how the BRZ ran an ethanol the process for switching over is pretty straightforward and again we've outlined that another video which is in the description basically though we just fill up your car with 85 when you're low fuel light comes on and drive the BRZ a few miles on to notice the field terms go way
negative on the tablet
there are some pros and cons to driving the BRZ any 85 1 con is that you're going to get about 25% worst fuel economy than you would on normal 91 or 93 gas especially if you're into the throttle a little bit more which you will be however 85 is typically about 25% cheaper than regular gas
so this wasn't an issue unless if we wanted to go out of town if you can live with this the big advantage to running a 85 is of course more power think the same smoothness and linear power delivery of the stage one open flash tuned but just more of it especially higher up in the RPMs
another advantage to running e85 on track is that you'll typically see cooler oil temperatures by about 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit because E 85 is a cooler burning fuel while running on e85 we took the BRZ to attract a at Waterford Hills Raceway in Clarkston Michigan
the car performed phenomenally all day long and managed a lap of 1 minute 23 dead not too shabby when on track the BRC no longer feels sluggish on the straights and can hold its own with some more powerful cars
we'd also like to see how the increase in power feels on a variety of wheel and tire setups including stock tires which have now been relegated to drifting duty until then here's some gratuitous drifting footage around clio
and is it at a point where we've accomplished what we set out to do with the car that is to create a well-balanced daily driver that can hold its own on the track and be fun to drive on the street basically everything that's great about a stock BRZ
it is quite a nice laptop it's quite curvy on the back of it you have two USB 3 ports a power port and you have a mini DisplayPort adapter
you both know that
Safari the vga
ok so just leave you look more of a close-up of the ports there's the one USB port there the display ports there's the slot for the Kensington locks if you want to lock it to a desk and on the other side you have the power port and the other USB port okay so if we power the laptop off you'll be able to see in real time how quickly it does actually boot up
now you have two options you can either use the trackpad to browse around just like a normal laptop or you also have the option of using the touchscreen so for example if
it has a backlit keyboard so if you're using it in low light conditions it has two levels so low and high so it is very visible and obviously the main feature of this laptop is it can be used other tablets as well
so you can use it in landscape or portrait mode and when you've finished it just clips back onto the dock and you can pick up where you left off so if you're working for a laptop and the tablets this is definitely a good one to go for
it's very fast
thanks for watching
Scott at UK today
graphics tablet now
Pro or a MacBook now this is connected via USB so it's hardwired device this is the small version it measures 248 by one seven six millimeters and ran about eight and a half millimeters deep
Express keys here
I've got it orientated
I've got configured to back so that when I'm in a browser I can use it to go backwards through Windows and then right click on this button and then a single click on this one and I can configure these to do whatever I want moving over
so this changes the speed of the track in the double tap time pointer acceleration as well which is very handy and then the touch functions as well shows you what you can actually do with the bamboo pen and touch
you can even add
attach to the left or if you want to perform a right-click you can tap with two fingers on the control pad now you can also add a touch to the right
I'll show you all of these in a short while there's also a pop-up menu which allows you to use the pen and to actually get access to consecutive menus when you're within applications so let's quit out of this system preference pane and show you how this works in real use so I'm still using the touch facility and I'll go into my browser now here
I would normally struggle if this was just a pen based tablet it would be quite hard for me to use with the browser and I'd always revert back to my mouse but now at least I can scroll up and down and I can even zoom in and out of this webpage to make the writing larger or smaller I can even go backwards to the page before or forwards again to the page
I've got some photos
I can even go into full-screen mode and then using that swipe function I can go backwards and forwards through my photos I can even rotate them using that rotate gesture and then you can see it does work
rotate gesture wasn't recognized
but and now it's recognizing them all and they're not going to course come back out of full screen so very useful again for navigating around the likes of of iPhoto so let's go into the likes of Pixelmator which is a graphics application
brush here and here
now this small version is going to cost you around about a hundred pounds if you want to go up to the medium version which gives you a lot larger active area and it would be certainly more suited to that graphics art use
I'm going to incorporate this review into an episode of my redesigning series this way I can talk about my experiences with this new tablet while also trying to be entertaining still
here's the thing though
a rechargeable pen all of the necessary wires a stand a drawing glove that makes me feel like a sci-fi character and the screen protector that was already installed on the tablet which
drawing my main inspiration for this redesign was another flaming knuckles redesigned done by a person named rosy pumpkin their design also reminded me of dr. Finn at Eva's from the Archie comics so I wanted to incorporate ideas from both dr. Finity this and this fan redesign into one new redesign
speaking of fire safety
I also wanted to keep that long sock look that original flaming knuckles had so I incorporated that also into the gloves adds more protection to his arms as well as for the shoes I really liked what rosy pumpkin did with the shoes so I took most of my inspiration from that I turned the bumps on his shoes into spikes and I gave the base of the shoe
I'm gonna do the line our off-camera and then we'll get to the colorings all right so I want to keep the color palette that original flaming knuckles had cuz I kind of like it still
Mon P D 1560 it's not bad at all the hit detection was very off when I plugged it in but after I messed with a calibration a bit I was able to actually get it
if you're interested
I probably do another video just like this cuz I had fun with this but don't worry guys I'm not making the redesign series specifically a commercial thing in fact I have another very huge redesign coming up
we did review about a year ago of a 13-inch Cintiq and our friends at Wacom actually reached out and asked us if we want to take a look at the one tablet which is another 13 inch unit
it's very budget-conscious
it's very budget-friendly
let's see here there
you've actually never used
this is the clips
i did a review of this about a year and a half ago and this is my iPad pro twelve point nine inch tablet and I use this for quick sketching
sometimes so you can see you know about how big this unit is you again just to compare there's an iPad here is the Wacom one now the Wacom one is about the same size as the 13-inch Cintiq there are some differences the Wacom one is actually plastic
it's not quite as sturdy in my opinion as the Cintiq but you're talking about a unit that is effectively half the price and you can see how the feet pop out you can see the extra nibs and yeah now
you know it is a little bit tougher these actually pop out they're spring-loaded and you know there are a lot more inputs but not all so the Cintiq has a touchscreen on it
Wacom one however
there's one connector
so there is that
I mean for $399
I said to connect to a laptop for drawing on the go and it is much more responsive in my opinion than even my iPad pro is with the Apple pencil and it's a lot sturdier too
it's it's very sturdy
I think it's a great great entry level tablet for folks that want to get into doing digital art but don't want to break the bank doing it but they still want performance and this definitely definitely performs
okay guys so
you can blend stuff
Oh what
that's a cue
this is well now
Lilly okay guys
it's first time
um final thoughts yeah
Wacom screen tablet
that's incredibly cheap
the performance is great
it is 4096 levels
it is a 13.3
inch display
it does not support
I was very confused
Cintiq that you will not be getting but again where it counts in the actual drawing ability for this tablet it really does it very very well especially for the price I mean again
I know some some of you out there who maybe are you know more into this kind of tech than I am might notice more of a difference but I didn't notice any difference in in performance started up drawing there were features you know that were available on the Cintiq that we didn't have on the Wacom one like touch screen like USB see support of the Cintiq is sturdier
it's very light
I think the hook ups not being very cumbersome is a huge bonus for me because I don't want to have to have a separate power supply and all that that stuff so this is great
she's never really used a tablet before and she's probably gonna be using this one because she actually had a pretty good experience with it and I'm gonna get her used to drawing digitally so I would say yeah
obviously if you are a professional or you need a bigger tablet or you just want more bells and whistles you're probably gonna want to invest in in a Cintiq but for the price
I really you know I have to give praise to Wacom for realizing that there is a market and absolutely for lower end tablets that don't sacrifice performance so if you're looking for a great entry-level
go to clownfish support
commnets clownfish support calm
that's clownfish talk comm
I'm Erin from tech gadgets Canada comm and I recently had a chance to try out the newest version this is the Amazon Fire HD or the all new Amazon Fire HD as
they're calling it
this tablet runs
Amazons fire operating system and it's an android-based mobile operating system made by Amazon designed for things like the fire phone the echo echo dot the Kindle Fire tablets and things like fire TV
now getting it set up couldn't have been easier once it's charged up you'll log into your Amazon account and it'll automatically populate your previous purchases like ebooks and Prime videos
it's actually a bit awkward for the volume rocker since it's not oriented in the traditional up-down configuration but I guess it's easy enough to adapt to there's two speakers and they're located on the side or the bottom I guess if you're using it horizontally you might be wondering what exactly is new with this device
none of which
the price has increased
I'm going to put all the specs on the website at tech gadgets canada.com so we don't eat up a lot of time here with the numbers but the memory capabilities have expanded as well the CPU is still the same
the resolution isn't what you're gonna find on most cell phones or high-end tablets today it's not a Retina display but then again it's not really supposed to be the tablet is budget priced
this is it
you're looking at video
you probably don't want to consider using it as your primary camera both because this is pretty big and bulky to carry around and also because it doesn't really have some of the capabilities of some of the new or higher and smart phones
that are coming out
fortunately the headphone
jack means
you shouldn't have to
you can play music using the speakers on your Fire HD 8 tablet if you want to using Amazon music now the sound gets loud and comes through just fine but it's certainly not going to give you the audio quality of something like an Amazon echo or an echo
plus you can put this in the category of it works just fine for the price and I don't mean that as any kind of negative criticism amazon says this tablet has Dolby
Atmos sound which may seem weird because you usually need overhead firing speakers for that but with the Fire HD 8 tablet the Dolby Atmos overhead effect is available when wearing headphones and listening to Dolby Atmos enabled content when using speakers the tablets use standard Dolby audio with a surround sound effect
Doc's weather and more if you want to have much of the functionality of a small tablet computer this device definitely puts it all right in front of you the Amazon Appstore comes loaded onto the tablet
I found that many of the apps I use in my daily life on my Apple iPhone were also available in Amazon's app store so that was a nice surprise the fire HD has a USB 2.0
it'll take slightly longer
I think she is just the smartest da by far and she does plenty for me on my echo device at home it's too bad that tablet users can't all so enjoy this service now in the United States
Canada with show mode your Fire HD 8 or Fire HD tablet basically can turn into a de-facto echo device so Alexa voice responses get enhanced with full-screen visuals on the screen but of course since Alexa is not enabled on the tablet the function doesn't work but what the feature is supposed to do is basically give you that Amazon echo or echo show experience on your tablet
something else unfortunately
it's compact and very light even if maybe it is a bit on the thicker side even so it's quite versatile and makes me realize just how much I've come to rely on Amazon for things like shopping music and now videos
it's priced and an astoundingly affordable $99 Canadian for the 16 gigabyte size and 129 dollars for twice the memory at 32 gigs the screen and the audio quality are fine and the variety of apps available is excellent what I disliked most about the tablet is all the features that aren't available yet video calling Alexa voice control show mode and more now while these will probably be delivered in a future software update
it's too bad they're not ready now even so if you're going to get this tablet at least you know some of its future potential but if these are features you need and want right now you might be better off with a different tablet though
overall there is a lot to love about the Fire HD 8 and there will be even more when Alexa comes out to play in Canada if you want a low price but versatile tablet for travel or the kids or to supplement another tablet
with the graphics tablets
please contact the manufacturer because I can't really help with your specific system what I did find was they were really easy to install and I actually installed them with my Wacom drivers still on the system
I was able to go into the drivers settings and change buttons and pen settings and so forth and I use this in Krita Photoshop blender and had no problems at all it works straightaway now
one thing you might be interested in is that this works with your mobile phone so it comes with a couple of connectors so for different devices and you can plug it in and you don't even need to install any drivers with your mobile phone
note program that I have but I'm sure there's better programs out there the pressure sensitivity worked very well in all the other things on the computer so that was great in terms of specification
LPI blah blah blah
I've worked with graphics
I'm not noticing the difference so I wouldn't worry too much about those sort of things but do look at reviews and just see what sort of art they're creating
do the drivers work
and you'll be fine
the one thing to look out for though is that this drawing area is fairly small if you look at my hand size and you look at something like my
so if you're really serious about drawing then you might want a bigger tablet but I would say this is a nice good starter tablet and I didn't find it difficult to draw on this it's just I prefer a larger size
that's all it's also worth noting that it comes with a wireless pen so you don't have to plug it in and worry about charging it up the pen itself is quite stiff and that's a bit like a Wacom tablet it's quite firm when you touch it other ones like XP pen I've found are quite squishy but it's just a preference thing I'm used to that sort of firm press from my Wacom so huion a slightly more similar to Wacom in that regards so all in all
I'm very impressed
I hope that helps
thanks for watching
crossover from lenovo
it's a killer budget option in the chrome world and i enjoyed doing this review so much that i almost spoiled all of it in that previous sentence but first here comes the spec sheet
let's talk display
we've got a 10.1
this and
it's vibrant
plus now
that's not me trying to say that you could compare this to say samsung's amoled display in the galaxy chromebook or anything like that but for a device that starts at 279 dollars
it'd be that for whatever reason it kind of seems like this screen attracts my fingerprints worse than any of my other touch-enabled devices but that also could be due to me insisting that i constantly bathe my fingers in oil from a deep fryer
let's talk power
i can play games
i can open a ton of basic browser tabs without it choking too hard but i would assume that the user base for this device will probably not be trying to push it to its limits like you know you would with one of the higher end units but i got to 20 open chrome tabs and like multiple videos before i really noticed any lag and even then it was kind of just momentary
even then i
let's talk battery
i am beyond impressed and i think it's very much worth noting that lenovo only quotes this at 10 hours and i thought that was kind of weird that i got 12 hours and i was like did i do something wrong
it's you know
it just isn't great
it's really really cramped
and that's due to the size of the device overall and if you have juicy mitts like mine it's kind of hard to type especially when some of the keys are cut in half vertically like the hyphen and plus key up here for example the trackpad unfortunately is even worse to the point
it's not very responsive
i kind of feel like at times my fingers stick to it a little bit and i still find it a little difficult to click and respond to that uh ultimately i kind of feel like you're just better off ignoring it and using your fingers on the touch screen
that's a tongue twister
we've got the outside one at eight megapixels and a front-facing one at two megapixels and you know what's funny this 279 dollar chromebook has a better webcam on it than a certain very expensive enterprise chromebook
i just recently reviewed
uh now of course
it's not you know it's still not turning me into the work of art that i know i am when i look into the mirror but it does much better with bad lighting and i actually think it reproduces color pretty well too lastly
it's like sturdy
of course
let's talk ports
only having port singular
i really wish it had two as i kept running into the same problems that i have with my phone for example so for example with this one if i wanted to use headphones on this and charge it simultaneously
i couldn't do that
i will mention
now that all said i guess a lot of people using this will probably be looking at this as a tablet more than a traditional laptop and because tablets typically don't have a lot of ports they might be willing to let it slide however i just know that i'm not that person
here's my final word
send me a comment
here's the deal
the functionality is seriously surprisingly great and the only thing you really have to come to terms with are the fact that there's just one port and the tiny keyboard and if you don't think you'd mind typing on a type like a tiny cramped keyboard i'ma tell you to jump on this right now or heck just take it off and just use it as a tablet like if the keyboard bothers you and you're still somewhat interested in this device i would tell you just to treat it like you would any other tablet like an ancillary device
please allow me to send you my amazon wishlist or venmo account information comparing this device to some of the other 400-ish dollar devices this year that i've reviewed kind of makes me wonder why those devices even exist now
especially because you know i haven't been overtly hot about chrome and the tablet world as i think you've seen in years past but i think they did a really great job with this one and i i i think you know it stands that that's why all these reviews have been so positive of it
congratulations to lenovo
you're excited about it
hopefully because you've been asking me about it a lot but it finally came in and up next is the acer chromebook spin 713 which i think wraps up most of the hotly anticipated reviews
welcome back everyone today
little pipo w2s tablet
it has an intel chery chery chery trail z8 three-zero-zero quad core 2 gigabytes of ram 32 gigabytes of rom and as - twice 2 megapixel cameras on it one on the front one on the back it runs
capacitive touchscreen - guys
but there's only like six point six one three that's not all the windows operating system on here as I say this is a sum of this is to do with the Android system what I'll do is I'll just boot into Android and we'll take a look at the Android storage and you'll be able to see what I mean
you didn't know that was going to happen so it will probably take a little while for we can boot it into Android so I'll just let it run through that
oh here we go
we're restarting already
that was quick
well the internal drive
then hopefully disk management
I think some of these are to do with the Android section and just here this little bit here is the Windows 19.7 9 for the windows and then we have about 1000 megabytes here is healthy recovery partition
what I'm intending to do with this particular tablet is I'm going to convert it over to Windows only operation because my phone is Android and I have a perfectly good Android tablet available to me to me as well so I you know Android is on this thing
it's quite nice actually
still you still got the disk management so I can do the same with that drag it down from the top and the way it goes disappear it just closes it quite easy way of doing things and say it's a nice lightweight little PC for you to carry around
this is a mini
Windows key just here and then we have the power and volume switches here is the Windows properties as you can see it also runs 64-bit operating system too which is quite good
you get this little cable here depth cable which is so you can plug a USB flash drive into that if it won't fit into the tablet itself and the tablet also uses a makes available to you ot G on-the-go as it were so you can actually plug in hard drives into it USB drives into it and they will you know it will actually talk to it and you can read information to and from it
Windows 10 on it
I've been messing about with this for a couple of weeks now and it took me quite some time to actually update it to the very latest Windows 10 because of the small amount of spite the hard drive space is available to it
I had a USB Drive with Windows creation media tool thing with Windows 10 home on it on there and then in this other port I had a very large
I think this was a 32 gigabyte USB Drive and that's purely to act as memory for the tablet whilst you're updating it because there's not enough you know internal memory the way it's set out to actually update it properly so I had to use this media creation tool here with Windows 10 on it
click on the windows and get the windows up and running so that was like trying to install it for you and then basically as I say you'll get to a certain point on it whereas you know what are the memory view got and you used this and just click on this one and it will actually then put information on here for you while it's installing it on here which is quite an easy way to do it but it's it takes a long long time until
I said while I was doing it the power ran out on the tablet here and I thought oh dear so basically I charged it up and when I plugged it back in he just asked for this set up again and just carry it on and did it and now I have this nice up-to-date Windows 10 running on here all future updates have had have run through quite nicely on Windows
I saw available on the Android side of things but I'm not using the Android on here as I say I'm going to see if I can clear the whole emmc drive down and just use it purely as Windows myself got plenty of Android kit here already and I quite like the way this runs on
it's let's try this
yes we can there
you've got six point
there we go
we go
that's all your programs
all the programs that are there all the installed programs are there for you to find or I seek it out on the the desktop sort of Windows 8 style
desktop thing here okay
so we can run it in tablet mode like this or we go into the notifications you click on the tablet mode and it will go back to a standard desktop
you know shortcuts
you used to and what have you don't go any shortcuts on here yet because I've been using in tablet mode now so it all depends on how you want your tablet to run whether you want to run Android and Windows 10 or just like I'm been doing Windows 10 only I get on quite well with it like that
obviously you know share stuff between this and your Windows PC as well which is quite easily done you've also got as I said we've got ot G on the go here so you can plug in like a hard drive into it so if you've got information on a hard drive or a large USB Drive like this one
there we go
we're in right
it will run with that too guys so basically if you have on these these covers that you get with an attached keyboard you could actually run it just like a little
I say we can go into you know your standard standard mode you know standard PC mode here so it's quite a little bit of qHD guys so you show it up and down
I enjoyed the review
I do apologize for that but I am quite busy with work and doing reviews and stuff but I do try to catch it with your comments and questions well anyway as I was saying thanks for popping over and I'll catch you later then guys Oh you
Android tablet
let me just bring the tripod down a little bit so you can see it and ease it to switch on press it there there you go not the best of screen so for side view you can still see it and everything
lock down one
where's my wife
I'm not working
no there we go
got one of the dog on here as well so this is the front facing camera which is sorry the the rear facing camera which is the better of the two
let's go back
desktop already
obviously you're going to have it set up for the individual child so they can come out and share and swap and everything if you want to go into your parent if you want to come out you can either set it up
you've got your micro
USB charging point there your micro USB there is for a nifty little thing that actually comes with it which is a micro USB 2 standard USB connector so if you wanted to use a memory stick or anything like that pop that into the put your memory stick in there and you can start watching videos or whatever you want so all in all volume controls
hello guys so in today's video we're going to be reviewing the drawing tablet by huion we own however it is pronounced so i just got it in the mail right now and i'm really really excited to try it out
i like it
it is very sleek
it's actually very light
it actually comes with two buttons that you can customize so that is very nice it also comes with a pen holder and if your pen tip ever wears out then inside you will find eight replacement nibs you can put the pen and the pen holder vertically however
this is the micro usb and usb type c adapters that it comes with for if you want to connect the tablet to your phone the usb to mini usb cable
so it's actually a little bit bigger but i think it is the perfect size to work on digital art or anything like that to turn the tablet on you literally
and it's on
this is where you can customize the keys what you want them to stand for and do both the hard keys and the soft keys you can also adjust the pen sensitivity and every setting
that is doable
in this tablet
also when i first got the tablet i was scared and regretting buying it because i couldn't get it to work so make sure you go to settings security privacy
if you're on mac so just be sure to do that before you start complaining so this is me thinking i could go straight into working on a homework assignment right
it was really hard
pack that day but yeah i was so sad i was like what purchase did i do however i decided to go buy the net back the next day i colored in this drawing that i had done before and just colored in very very loosely just to practice so i definitely recommend doing this
don't get mad it's gonna take you like maybe three days for you to get used to it and then it's gonna feel very natural but the first days it was very hard so then later the third day
i went back with this drawing that i had on a sketchbook and tried tracing it and coloring it the tracing part for the outline was very difficult as well
it took me forever
don't give up
when i was coloring
it takes practice
i've never actually used photoshop to paint just to edit photos and stuff like that so it was a challenge using a brand new tablet that i've never used before in a program that i haven't experienced too much
pretty nice for it being my first time and actually i edited this video using the tablet as well as you can see here so it doesn't just work for painting you can edit photos you can use it as mouse and everything
i'm pretty sure this option just works if you have an android so if you don't have an android it must suck to suck just kidding but yeah it doesn't even work that great on most um android devices this is a samsung galaxy
s6 and you cannot see the cursor at all so although you can connect the tablet to the phone that i have i wouldn't say it's 100 usable or compatible since you cannot see the cursor and it's hard to see what you're doing
i'm pretty sure
works if you get what i mean all right so overall my press for this tablet is that it has 26 keys in total because remember eight hard keys 16 soft keys plus the two keys that come in the pen it also is very customizable which i love
my cons would be that it does not have a cursor on all devices like on my phone and that the pen holder is a little bit wobbly apart from my cons right now i actually would recommend this tablet 100
it was the best deal i could find on amazon and online everywhere really for its size and all of its features that it comes with so if you want to buy one i'll have a link down below it's not affiliate or anything like that but i do recommend it
alright guys well
hey guys here
that's kind of unique because in most Android tablets have a 16 by 9 aspect ratio and for example most 10.1 inch Android tablets and those are more suited for watching videos rather than something like this which is a more boxy shape than rectangular and so it actually has the same aspect ratio as you'll find on the Apple iPad or an HP TouchPad so it's more suited for web browsing for playing applications as well as for reading which are again more mainstream applications in just watching videos
ARM Cortex processor
there's also GPS module built in along with a 2.0 megapixel webcam that's also able to shoot actually 720p HD video which is actually pretty impressive there's a Bluetooth 2.1 also Wi-Fi b/g/n N and there's serious speakers and accelerometer as well as a compass and a ambulant light sensor built on in
this is kind of interesting because I always thought that Apple had a had a copyright aspect on that type of charger and so to see Lipan which is another third-party electronic electronics manufacturer
we've actually heard from the manufacturer and so it's pretty important for the company to actually have a good start with this product and I think that for the most part the lab hand TC 970 is a successful Android tablet so in the Box we have a QuickStart guide
so it's gonna be good to have a clean cloth ready when you're using a tablet also inside the package is the four mention 30-pin dock connector the same one you'll find on your iPod iOS device as well as a love hand
it does have a very positive and premium feel in the hand which seems to contradict the fact that it only comes in at a very inexpensive price tag of $200 so on the back
and that's pretty much
and that's made basically it like we said the chrome sides on the tab will definitely add to the flare and design aspect and we definitely liked it as a overall design aspect from lapan the parent device up
thanks to the fact that has a 720p or WVGA resolution on it and you can also see that above the screen we have the aforementioned 2.0 megapixel webcam for self counting applications like Skype or WeChat and along the side here because this is a Android 2.2 based tablet instead of having all these controls on-screen they're actually physical controls
viewing angle
this is very impressive
even if you're holding it from different positions which is very good from the screen's perspective now one aspect that we were kind of fouled that l'p hand didn't do a very nice job of this actually the backlit functionality on the actual controls and buttons and this is because as you can see here whenever you press a button they do light up for a few seconds
you'll be able to see it but unfortunately we don't understand my lip hand doesn't just make these buttons light up all at once and said after you press the button
it's gonna light up
which is kind of counter kind of contradicting with what you might actually think because again if you're completely in the dark you can't see any of these buttons you can really see these buttons after you press them and it kind of defeats the purpose of having the light there in the first place otherwise again with Android 2.2 it's a pretty earlier early build of Froyo and the nice thing about the Lipan tablet is it's a very generic build of the operating system
and that's basically it
there aren't any you know extra games or below where that a manufacturer installed onto the device which means that you can actually use the memory to install the apps that you want other rather than the apps that the manufacturer wants which is certainly nice to see now as a 1 gigahertz arm cortex processor one of the main concerns
we had for this tablet was the fact it's going to kind of sluggish and so unresponsive now luckily at through our testing we found the device to actually pre fast and responsive and so as a result we were never really you know disappointed with the performance aspect
sure there's gonna be a little bit more stuttering than you're expected from modern deign tablets especially if you're browsing very flash heavy sites but overall we found that it was a pretty good tablet for overall games like which had some basic navigational functionalities and using the gallery as long as you aren't using too many 3d intensive applications and games then I think will be fine with the tablet another aspect of where the Lipan tablet excels at is battery life coming in at over six hours
the battery just lasts a very nice very long period of time which is certainly pretty impressive and standby mode also lasts around two weeks straight which is also very good now
the battery life kind of drained a little bit faster and was only able to last us through around five hours but still it's a pretty impressive figure now turning on the wife you can see
HD video resolution which is something that a lot of tablets when this device was first released actually had and that's because back in those days we saw a lot of webcams on Android tablets being 1.3 megapixels or even VGA resolution so having the 720p resolution is pretty impressive
most things are pretty or sensitive and easy to press and well the multi-touch functionality works pretty nicely in the max and the web browsing experience and so it definitely allows you to use the device
more ease lessly easily rather than difficulty and for the most part Gmail applications and everything loads pretty well now but think a thing to be noted of is of course this vise is Andrew a 2.2 so essentially
it essentially looks very stretched and you can see how all the icons are extremely large and again a reason for that is because it's essentially a smartphone but with a larger display on this particular tablet
I think for elderly people or even for kids because you know icons are very large and you won't have to squint at the tablet to read the smaller icons into smaller text taking a look at the web browsing experience for example if we go to some something like just go to Google right now and we'll see if that works and it's just a traditional Android keyboard which actually works pretty well for them part
you can see that the accelerometer also works pretty fast and you can switch back and forth between the four axes of the accelerometer and all four are enabled so unlike some devices
you actually have a host of different language settings in the Box that you might not typically find from a mainstream manufacturer now for example if you go into the language and keyboard you'll be able to see that you have not just Spanish and you know in French or just English
you actually have all these different settings from Dutch to English even Chinese on here and there's also Korean so it's a lot more settings we might traditionally find from an android-based tablet of this caliber and price price range
so it's a great gift as well if you have any relatives living in other nations and other countries and you're worried about purchasing something that might not support their language
Store application
most of the up-to-date applications movies games and reading content for you to use the device and again you can see how when we're holding the device in this portrait style view it really just has the same orientation and it's same aspect ratio on the screen
so it's pretty comfortable for reading text and you can also see how sharp the display is which is again very impressive and the same thing with the viewing angle that we talked about so again
we're watching videos again
dubs as smart keys if you use it for extended periods of time for example pressing the search button once will bring up the search keyboard however if you press on the search button for extended periods of time it's gonna take up the voice search command function for example
that didn't search well
the pan
tablet pc is searched and again it basically recognizes your voice in a pretty nice degree when we were testing it so there shouldn't be any issues with recognition as far as that aspect it goes so overall the Lipan tablet is a pretty compelling device to get especially again if you're looking for something that's inexpensive
we have a more traditional eyes a more boxy form factor like that of the Apple iPad and also the fact that has larger icons coupled with more language supports is also another plus now the specs are anything too
well as well weighing in one point six pounds but still has a very solid construction quality and so it does feel more premium than the price would suggest so overall pretty good tablet
Peter where do the major selling points behind Android 9 so they used to have a little Apps logo at the bottom that you click and it opens up your stuff but now you just scroll upwards this allows you to have more elements on the bottom of the screen
Android tablet so
so if you click that it shows you everything that comes pre-loaded on the device that our Walmart based this is the Walmart shopping app where you'll find everything from electronics to clothes
so you'll have to use zip codes to find things doesn't actually work in Canada if Walmart grocery app allows you to actually click on things that you want to shop for
you want add them to your cart up top and then you can choose your pickup location from your nearest location by entering your zip code this allows you to have everything boxed up and ready for you by the time you into the store then you go up to the pickup location
I even checked barcode listings on the top search bar the Vudu app allows you to watch movies and TV shows and all that kind of thing but really again it only works in the States you might have seen Vudu when you buy DVDs
have an e-book and audiobooks section where you buy like gift cards basically or and they have like ear eaters available as well that you can buy in a store as well as online so this is the Rakuten Walmart ebook app so it looks a bit different from the main
Kobo app
which you might be familiar with if you're on this channel so this is like the official app from Walmart so when you buy devices like Kobo devices or this type of tablet you do have like an e-book reading like experience so we already logged in with our account so let's look at some of the options so you do have page transition if you want it to fade or slide or curl you have some comments you can change pages using volume keys orientation all that kind of fun stuff you can also change the text here this changes via a slider bar and you can go full page layout or two-page spread upon rotation got it got it you can long press and that gives you some options okay
I got it again
Peter is cool save that I guess I would say so share to Facebook share to other social media platforms based on the apps that you have on the device Wikipedia at the bottom full of you to actually go to the website and search in book
you made a bookmark
the official store looks different from the main home screen which gave us recommended reads and things like that so this is like the full store experience where you can purchase audio books
ebooks new releases
so that's the home
Kobo's like writing competition
you can actually place pre-orders on upcoming books because we're in Canada it's geo-locating to the Kobo dot see a Walmart dossier experience so Global Mail bestsellers new and hot fiction
the reds are red
HD experience watching Netflix
thanks for watching our review video on an 8-inch Android tablet from Walmart under the on brand for getting me to draw a comma name is Michael this is Peter everybody take care
listen here there is no such thing as what you need to be a real artist and I'm gonna prove it I'm gonna go online right now and I'm gonna buy the cheapest graphics tablet that I can find and then I'm gonna take a sketch and I'm going to take it to a finished piece of artwork and I'm gonna put this debate to rest once and for all I'm gonna regret this
I review tech here tech for creative people and I get a lot of cool expensive toys coming into my office that I get to you so it could be easy to see what I do on a weekly basis and think wow I need the latest greatest graphics and drawing tech in order to make good art but that that's just not true
yeah it's great to know how many levels of pressure sensitivity something has or how good a screen is but at the end of the day what it comes down to is skill and practicing that sort of thing and any kind of entry level tablet should be able to do the job right well
I have a sketch
I have a cartoony clean ink style so I'm very particular about the kind of lines that I'm producing with the graphics tablets that I'm using and I'm hopefully gonna be able to show as I go through this video that I can do it on a pretty inexpensive tablet and at the end of the day

ah you know what
here's my review
eight out of ten
let's open it up
we got a pen which now we have two of these pens so just in case something happens to one you never know and here it goes and gonna be really gentle with you this time this is the hooey on 420
the thing to know about these graphics tablets is that they are USB so you're gonna need this USB cable to plug into your computer and what you're gonna do is you're gonna use one of these pens to draw on this tablet and these lines that you draw here are gonna show up on your computer screen in front of you
nibs wear out
these are tiny
I don't know if you can see these let me see if I can zoom in a little focus buddy these are some extra nibs and a little nib replacement thing so we can replace the nibs when our pen wears out
we've got our pen
that's also very expensive
there are some free applications out there and I would check out one of my videos from a couple of weeks ago where I talked about five free apps that are actually really good like Krita and Metis bet and everything that I'm gonna be doing here
I could do in those other applications just as easily now when I look at this drawing the very first thing that really jumped out to me was how hard it was to use this tablet at first because of its size it really took a lot of adjusting on my end to get used to it
you're drawing it
it's gonna come out bigger on the screen above now as I'm getting used to this this led to a lot of inaccuracies that led to a lot of wobbly lines so what
that's why you don't see me zooming out a lot of illustrators will tell you hey you should zoom in out so you can see yourself drawing at a real scale
I found myself drawing with my wrist a lot more instead of using my whole arm because my whole arm was making bigger movements that I wanted to make whereas my wrist and my fingers were giving me more control over the smaller area that I was drawing and again yet another reason for me to zoom in to get those details right and to get better line quality out of this thing and through most of the inking process that was the main thing that I was dealing with in fact by the end of the inking process
that was ok so
I mean I want a color within the lines but you have the edge of the line to get up to and if I overshoot from time to time which I do in a lot of times especially when I'm coloring in big areas I'm not too worried about it because I know I'm gonna go back in when I fill in some of the other areas and get some of those details just right now overall what I'm doing with this is I'm losing a lot of mid-tone colors even darker colors in some places than I otherwise would've and I'm using a lighter color in the background and when this is all said and done I'm gonna end up going back in and adding a big shadow layer basically creating a new layer drawing in it with all black to create my shadow and then reducing the opacity
I still want you to be able to see the details but I want to get the benefit of a really strong silhouette with this character and a little critter that he's scanning on the rock by the end of this
another thing that I'd have to get used to and and not clench my pen quite so tight when I'm drawing but overall I am really really happy with how this turned out and I think if I had shown this to an older version of myself from the past
folks are just starting out and you're just trying to get a hold of this digital art thing and some of this can be intimidating and also a little bit confusing at times so
so the Galman PD
but don't let that fool you into thinking is medium in terms of quality or can only create medium art galvan currently has a promotion going on from November 5th to December 5th
a pen with 8,192 levels of pressure a pen charging cable a screwdriver and screws for the stand a QuickStart manual and then the tablet itself and a screen protector hooking up
you might say blue
dude it's super easy
ma'am ha ha
protector itself feels awesome
just keep in mind
if you pick up this tablet that you need to be incredibly careful about cleaning everything off the screen and applying the protector properly to avoid these bubbles out of the box
I found that the colors didn't quite match up with my laptop monitor but after a few tweaks in the built-in display settings I was able to get things looking good
the 8192 levels of pen pressure makes the drawing feel smooth and fluid adjusting between different amounts of pressure the Galman PD 1560 has a screen size of 15.6 inches at 1080p HD which I find to be large enough to draw without feeling cramped but small enough that I can carry around with me if I need to
it took quite a bit of getting used to mainly because most of my prior art experience wasn't even on paper it was with a mouse but I was eventually able to emulate my usual Mouse arch style using the tablet
and that's cool
this tablet is good
if you want to graduate from a pad tablet to a display tablet having this as my first tablet there was definitely a learning curve however it didn't really take too long to get up and running if you decided to pick this up
hello and welcome to
it is nice
very nice it's got
I've ever used now
program was really good
UG and the gamin
we can't program them for different programs so if I'm going to blender and I want my pen to be slightly different to how it is in Photoshop then this is working began and the Yugi and the Hurons
you might want to comment below and read the comments as well and see what other people are saying about their tablets because I can't test them all of course but this is by far in the best what best one I've ever used
it's very fluid
I'm kind of blown away in a sense but I do prefer display tablets because you see what you're drawing on so it's not something I would choose over a display tablet again
the only problem
I couldn't use it on my main machine because it interfered with the Wacom drivers and I think that was actually a Wacom issue rather than XP pen issue but we do have this problem at work as well when we have to try and put lots of different drivers for different graphics cards onto the machines the XP pens don't like other drivers being on there and in fact not many of them do to be honest but some like Gammons seems to work with everything I don't know how but it just does so if you maybe run a college or a machine that's public then
if you want lots of different tablets being plugged in and out of it but generally that's not going to affect many people so the drivers were very good and I didn't have any problems
you occasionally get the sort of little glitch that you just have to watch out for and undo and that's just one of those things so it might pick up your palm in some way which is quite strange but it's just a little bit's like that but this it didn't happen at all with this it's a really fluid
nice experience
I'm not saying it isn't but the cheapest display tablet I've come across is a hundred and sixty pounds so this is starting to get to that level but that was a cheap one from gammon and I'll put the link in the description
but the fact that you're getting a display tablet does improve your workflow over just a normal tablet so it's a tough one to decide but if you are in the market for you know spending a lot of money on your graphics tablet you're an artist but you can't quite break into that display tablet band then this is definitely the one for you and I can actually say I've referred over the Wacom now
I won't show them
I'm just using this for testing purposes and then I'll get back to my display tablet of course so in terms of how long it's going to last and it
it looks a really good build as it's well put together and everything like that as you'd expect it's got this sort of metallic finish and it's quite solid so
I don't think you'll have any problems but I can't say that safely so again if you've had experience of this and you've enjoyed it and you're using it for a while now then put it in the comments
thank you very much
Katy sixteen screen tablet
Wacom screen tablet that
I've tried apart from the iPad pro and though the huge price difference means that I don't think it would be fair to directly compare it to my 1200 pound Cintiq
I have to go against so I was very interested to get the chance to try a product from a lower price brand and just see how it performs so the Kempton
it's for a screen
you also get a tablet glove for protecting the tablet surface from the oils on your hand and it also allows your hand to glide more freely across the surface
then you get a little stand for the pen which is wooden and I thought it was very nicely presented and you get a little box which had ten spare nib stored inside it so that when you wear the original one down you can replace it
Kenting pen is shorter and it doesn't have an eraser on the end so that may be something to consider if that's intrinsic to your process in any way it's also fairly light the stand is as I mentioned wooden which I found surprising because they're usually plastic and as a really nice modern look and generally looks great on your desk so I was pretty impressed in particular with the pen
they're quite firm
I think you know a little cleaning cloth which is always useful a QuickStart guide and then a leaflet showing you where to find the links to download the drivers
it was too big for me so I ended up using my one that I already had but the thought of including if a glove was definitely appreciated speaking of gloves you will notice at some point in this video
I'm just really cold
challenge for left-handed users because tablets are generally made with right-handed users in mind and the stands are developed so that by default the shortcut keys will be on the left
the stand felt very sturdy and it didn't easily move but when it was turned over to left-handed use it felt much more like it was going to slide around the desk
I did have to end up using blue tactus get down on the corners or it kept sliding back so it felt in my opinion as if left-handed users were a bit of an afterthought which I found a bit of an occurring issue with screen tablets which is part of the reason I chose the 22 HD Cintiq but it's kind of a thing that I feel should be prioritized more because left-handed people do exist
I gave up and bought an HDMI adapter for - so if you see me using two separate computers in this video that's why for anyone who might find this information useful for whatever reason
I don't want to mess it up when I have work to do on that one and then it just keeps it fair so I can compare the tablets more easily on the same computer
the software of this tablet allows you to choose your options to set the tablet - left or right hand the juice and then to adjust your pen pressure and various other shortcut settings as well
I tried it out with medibang paint tool sai and clip studio to get a fair look at how it performs compared to others because there is a software that I've used before the pen is a bit lighter than I'm used to but it was comfortable enough it had a good grip and it doesn't contain a battery so there's no need to charge it
which is amazing because I'm immediately cut off of buying a tablet if I find out you have to charge the pen so I'm horrible at remembering to charge things and obviously if I'm going to be using a tablet all day most days then I don't want to be sitting around waiting for things to charge so for me making sure that the pen doesn't have a battery is a huge priority
it did come with some air bubbles at the bottom which luckily wasn't on the active area of the screen but I thought it was a little bit annoying considering it came with it already attached and I thought it should have been put on a little bit better
I don't have any precise color calibration software so I can't give a definitive answer on how accurate it was but when I transferred the image that I'd completed to my other computer
so that's my incredibly unprofessional judgment there of the accuracy of these colors but the color gamut is very broad it's actually broader than my Cintiq so it's very impressive again for the price
I calibrated the tablet
it's not an indicator of how it looks when viewed from the front so it's kind of weird but I think it's just the camera not quite keeping up with what's going on on the screen
click you can customize it for whatever setting you want and I set it to zoom in and out you can also choose the speed at which it zooms you're not just like zooming in and out or scrolling up and down at breakneck speed
the right way up for left-handed use the cursor would move as if the tablet was still the other way up so when I move the pen upwards the cursor would go down and so on so I've had this issue before including with Wacom tablets and it seems to be a persistent thing so it's kind of annoying to keep having to go into the settings and reset the left-handed use but it just seems to be a pervading issue across all brands when it comes to left-handed users
I did record the lineart process of this illustration but unfortunately due to a disagreement between the screen recording software and my mum's laptop which I was using before I switch to this one it ended up recording 45 minutes of the lower right hand corner of the screen so I have is the colouring but hopefully that will give you enough indication of how it works
I didn't feel like I was bending down and slouching my back to use it which I found with 13-inch screens and if you're used to a laptop you're already the experience with viewing a screen of around this size when you work on your art overall
I feel that it does need some serious optimization for left-handed users to ensure that it consistently functions without trying to reset itself and there was no way I could have used it without sticking it down to the desk in some way because it just kept sliding back so if you're right-handed you won't need to worry about those problems but if you're left-handed it may be worth reconsidering waiting for an update or just going for it with the awareness that you'll experience some hiccups
the practicalities of this product are well considered in terms of having three storage options for the pen and the amount of included accessories was fairly impressive and they seemed a pretty good quality
I've only used this tablet for a couple of weeks so I can't speak for the longevity of it and I don't know how long it will last but overall it feels pretty solid and I'm cautiously optimistic for anyone who may want to know because I can't go for one video without talking about my original characters the first one I drew here was my half
he's the eldest child of a family running a storage business in the capital city of Crown Haven and he's very tall and lanky and softly spoken with a love of astronomy and writing and puzzles
this is perfect for digital art and this model is more affordable than others on the market while this is not a sponsored video the company was kind enough to send me this tablet so
I could test it out and I want to say a big thank you to XP Pen for allowing me to make this video as always with my review videos the opinions and thoughts that I give in this video are my own and 100% honest ok so I'm going to start by unboxing the tablets having a look at what comes in the box they're more walkthrough set up and then I'll create an illustration and Photoshop and talk about my experiences using the screen to start with
the tablet is fifteen point six inches and has an HD resolution of 1920 by 1080 it has six Express keys down one side and the design is quite thin and light so if you wanted to move it around it would be quite easy to do so after the tablet all the accessories are stored neatly in this little box and everything you need to work on
a tablet comes in the box except of course for your drawing program and PC first we have the driver CD and then there were a few cards including a warranty and a QuickStart guide in several different languages
I never draw on the screen without the glove and it helps your hand glide easily across the screen and just generally helps to protect the screen as well also included was a cleaning cloth for cleaning the screen
Express keys down one side which you can customize the pen can rest on the stand upright or on its side and the spare nibs are inside the pen stand
so it's all very compact there are a couple of different plugs and power adaptors and you should be able to find one that fits where you live and then we have a group of cables
one to plug the screen into the power source two to link the screen to your PC via an HDMI and a USB slot but the company has grouped the cables together as much as possible
I did that and it took seconds to set up and I left all the settings on default for now but you can go in and easily play around and adjust all the settings the Express key shortcuts on the tablet and the pen you can explore the sensitivity levels and set everything the way you like it there were also settings on the tablet itself brightness contrast in color and so on
so you can match you your tablet screen to the PC screen in order to get the correct colors and settings the first thing I like to test is how well the pen works and the pressure sensitivity so I made a couple of test pages and I'm using Photoshop for all the artwork today and to start and make these wavy lines pressing hard and then light above the pen and just go through varying my pressure and lines
I'm not using anything
I could get a lot of line variation and this is a good practice exercise and a good way to get to know your new tablet and just to play with how much pressure you need to apply to get the line that you want then after a few pages of test lines
I drew the line art and then worked on the colouring whilst I'm doing that I'll talk about the performance of the tablet whilst I was drawing I worked on this piece over a couple of days in two to three hour segments
so if you have a larger budget or you want a bigger screen then there are more expensive models and if you have a smaller budget or want to solve a size screen then they do have cheaper ones available this model
if you're thinking of getting one of these screens then you do need to consider desk space as you need to set your screen up near your PC or your laptop and to be able to have everything plugged in whilst you're working so your desk space and getting a tablet that will fit
I normally do and I didn't get a disconnect which can sometimes happen if you like me and you work traditionally most of the time and then you switch to drawing digitally sometimes you can get a bit of a disconnect and I didn't find
I had much of one when I was working on this tablet because it was laying flat and it felt like I was just sitting and drawing at my desk I can amelie do I was also able to move the tablet around and I actually had it on my lap for a while whilst I was drawing just because the tablet was light and thin enough and lays flat it was easy to just pop it on my lap through a bit
I still needed
I think if you'd like to work in different areas of your house for example and you worked off a laptop you could easily set up your screens in different places without too much travel
I always forget to plug them in and then I have to stop what I'm doing in order to charge them and not having this an issue was really good with this pen as for lag and delay when drawing
the pen moved
there will always be a little lag between the two screens but I didn't find it noticeable as I said and it didn't affect my drawing in any way also if your PC is slow like mine then you can get more delay issues occasionally because of that and that's not the tablets problem that can be because your laptop or PC is running a larger program like Photoshop and it's slow or old
PC then this is probably not an issue for you but it may be helpful to those of you who are like me and working with an older computer as for any problems
this is an important thing to do when you set the tablet up because if there are any bug fixes or improvements the company has made then they will be in the updated driver
it did for me
also if you get into a model at any point with the settings or when you're playing around with the express keys and sometimes if you double click a button too many times and some strange things happen
sensitivity is lovely
I liked I didn't have to charge it and of course the smallest size was helpful for me the Express keys are really useful if you use a lot of shortcuts when working and apart from a simple driver update
working with the tablet
I think if you're looking for something as an entry-level to drawing screens then this one may be a good choice for you and the company does have others if you have different if you have a different budget so you can check that out if you'd like to see the different options available anyway
that's my final
and today we'll be
it's also password protected screen time limits and content management to make sure that your kids are safe while they um without supervision from the adults and it comes with a pre-installed popular kid arts apps designed for kids so let's take a look inside so what you have back here
is the back camera
this is the speaker
and here's the stylus
that's his nose rainbow
i've been eating my
what's up here sandy
hey guys whoo
Leon has generously sent me their Q Levin K graphics tablet so today I'll be going over some cool features giving my review and also sharing a painting I made while using the tablet
thank you card
I found the driver installation CD a Quick Start Guide a nice way deep in holder a micro USB cable and a pen charging cable and then eight replacement nibs the wireless receiver and the PF 150 pin
I don't have a CD drive on my laptop so I went to the website to download the driver and installing the driver and getting started with the tablet was super simple
I'm loved at first
I was using the micro USB cable because I was afraid of the possibility of lag but when I gave the wireless functionality ago I was pleasantly surprised I didn't experience any lag at all and it felt the same as when I had
I like working in many different places to keep things fresh so having my materials be easy to transport as a definite plus the q11 que is compatible with Windows and Mac and it also works with all major drawing and painting programs
I really enjoyed using it and I'm very thankful to be able to have a Hooley on tablet now as I've always wanted to try one I would definitely recommend this tablet
I like to do this because that's what I'm used to from my previous tablet and I sort of have a 10 year muscle memory for it but I also find that having this button be the color
big thanks to Hui on for sending me this tablet to try I very much look forward to using it more in the future if you'd like to check out the Q 11k and where you can buy one online
hey guys and today
I've been using this tablet for over a year now so I thought that I should make a review on it now before the video starts I want to talk about two things first of all
it really means a lot and I'm going to keep on making OSA videos secondly I've only used this tablet for osoo purposes so I'm not going to dive into the signature or the drawing aspect of it the XP pengie 430 is a gaming tablet
it comes with of course the tablet but then the cable is already attached to it since it's not a micro USB connection then there's the pen which is a passive pen meaning
they market this tablet
as a gameplay tablet
the accuracy is within 0.01 inch now the product itself is 130 by 107 by 2 millimeters shows up so it's 2 millimeters thick which is pretty thin there are 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity
the tablet works right when you plug it in so you don't need any driver whatsoever but if you want to make adjustments on the active area all you have to do is go to their website
I choose a monitor
click and you cannot change that so when you're playing osoo if you drag just like me you have to press f10 to disable left click now back to the tablet
so how is the gameplay aspect of this tablet ok so first of all the pen is very light so it's probably because you don't have to replace batteries or charge it or anything but seriously it is lighter than the hooey on
Oh sue
oh yeah
I forgot one thing since the pen is very light it is very easy to control and it is easy to make fast movement now for the users who drag the pen across with tablet
I guess that's okay
thanks for watching
be sure
IP pen display
everybody loves those
these chords are important
don't lose them
don't lose them please
it's a Phillips screwdriver
it's pretty easy
I don't know just you can adjust the stand to wherever you know you have the best leverage to screw it in or whatever and oh yeah you got your tablet on a stand good job
Yap format it
that's probably what
don't lose that please
I was like
that's all done
oh my gosh
it's working again
other things about the tablet it has like 10 shortcut keys and the five menu keys around is on the side by the shortcut keys and from top to bottom it's Auto - plus menu and then the power button is on the bottom
when you do that
I already did but whatever but when you first start out drawing like that it takes a while to get used to but also at the same time I think you should start out with something like that because this tablet's pretty big and it looks really professional even though I am it definitely not a professional times my pen just like stops working and I don't know why but usually I can fix it by just opening up like the Galman tablet thing on my desktop and just like clicking onto the stylus pen and putting pressure on the screen and it will work again and if not I just like turn the tablet off and then I turn it back on whenever something is wrong with the tablet you can always just turn it off and then turn it back on
it's pretty easy
you can do that on the driver on your computer and then when you screw on your stand you have to put it on upside down because it'll be flipped so if you're left-handed it'll be easier for you or if you just like it that way
obviously it's been a very long time and I've been working on a milestone video for 50k because I hit that milestone anyway because of the holidays and I still have school
I doubt it
I'm not trying to like make a crap ton of money on that like Jake Paul or something but I mean it cuz some of you guys want it so there you go
to the right
fhd resolution
it can't manage multitasking
this may be enough
there is too much noise in the images however we must not forget that the resolution of 2 megapixel can do so much and this tablet is not for photography but for point and shoot use
i feel that too but when speaking from the price point it's a good choice since it does not support fast charging it takes around 3 hours to fully charge the battery
this is particularly good
hissing sounds they worked
the keyboard is very sleek and you are able to use it very easily though there might be some difficulty while typing because it's not a regular size keyboard but still it was fine for me for those looking for a robust and versatile tablet for school study and a bit of entertainment the alcatel 1t10
it is very understandable
Tab s 10.5
let's puts this beautiful
hi this is
so let's have a closer look at the Samsung Galaxy Tab s 10.5 so this is the Tab s 10.5 and the striking thing about this device is the Super AMOLED screen and also one more thing that I like is Samsung has burnt some software
Office at it now
UI which is optimized for tablets and is very similar to the TouchWiz that is used on Samsung Android smartphones and this is the screen that I was talking about the highlighting factor about this is the Super AMOLED screen and it's a very high resolution
Exynos octa-core processor
I'm a little bit disappointed by just the 16gb of internal storage but yes it does have micro SD card slot and it can accept microSD cards up to 128 gigs and just notice these pictures
s due to that
Super AMOLED display
on this tablet
and you can use that to unlock the tablet and fortunately it works a lot better than the Samsung Galaxy s5 another good thing that I found with this tablet is that this tablet has profiles for multiple users so if multiple users are going to use the tablet then it is an ideal solution also
this tablet has an IR blaster using which you can control devices like televisions etc and it does support USB OTG out of the box this Galaxy Tab s 10.5 also supports site sync
let's say if your phone is just charging around but still you want to use the phone you can also accept calls directly from the tablet if you are using the Samsung Galaxy S Y using this side sync feature if you ask me what is the one highlighting factor about this tablet then
it's not uncomfortable to hold for long periods of time so if you are looking for a very vibrant and a bright display on a tablet definitely have a look at the Samsung Galaxy Tab s 10.5
they should have launched even the Wi-Fi only variant thus lowering the cost of this tablet but sadly that's not the case so these are the minor cons but apart from that if you're looking for a premium Android tablet with a great display definitely
we have this cart
oh okay so
this is the base of the pen stand there are eight replacement nibs included and this is the nib remover with some instructions on how you can remove the nibs and we have pack of extra nibs and lip remover here now this pen case this is made of some sort of felt and this is the pen
it's very solid
it's actually quite solid
I like the design
this is mapping
the left hand mode
I have the wheel mapped to zooming in are changing the brush size and the zoom this pen support slightly over 8,000 levels or pressure sensitivity but the pressure is not working right now so it could be an issue with
it's better now
it's much smoother
I'm using the scroll wheel to change the brush size and it's very responsive and now I'm using the scroll wheel to change the zoom so it works very well so 8015 pro is close to us
lag the lines
I've just corrected
it's not as smooth
it's smoother this is
it's a horizontal rectangle
I'm using a toothbrush
I reviewed have this
I actually do have to mention this because very often people will ask me whether or not you have a screen on the tablet or do you have to look at your monitor and draw
this is clip studio
paint pressure
works really well
that's fantastic
button here in the middle of the wheel when I press it it still changes the brush size when I press it again is still changes the brush size it should change to zoom but for some reason it doesn't work here but if I assigned a function switch to one of these buttons it will work
so if you are someone who needs finer control over pressure sensitivity and you are using a Mac and I'm not sure if I can recommend this tablet right now unless they release a newer driver to correct this problem
$60 it looks good
it's well-built
I've tested on Windows
that i've mentioned of the year i recommend other brands and speaking of other brands i have a lot of reviews for other brands of tablets on my blog and also youtube channel
that works with computers
Android phones and tablets.
Android devices only.
What’s in the box?
Adaptors for the cable.
For computer use
Go to huion.com/download.
Type in HS64.
Right click, extract.
Double click the installer.
Turning on Mouse Mode makes it so that your tablet always picks up where you left the cursor no matter where on the tablet you hover. Game Mode turns off pressure sensitivity but increases how fast data flows from the tablet to the computer.
And the last tab
It’s so cheap!
I mean, if I had a few more dollars I would pick something a tad bigger with more shortcut buttons - but this is great, and the fact you can use it with a phone is pretty cool.
I guess if you were ONLY planning on drawing on a phone and not a computer, a phone stylus would be the right way to go… assuming your phone is compatible with one and it’s a pressure sensitive stylus.
The fact you can’t rotate the phone to draw in landscape mode was a bit of a let down, but I didn’t have any trouble working in the upright phone position.
stand for this, though.
I’m very lucky
That’s it, really.
Hope this helps!
S but if anything
I think they were actually on sale right now for a hundred and ninety-nine dollars as I type this now as always visit my website for reviews on other tablets and more consumer products
S on paper
this time or it dimpled back like previous models it resembles and somewhat here feels like an aluminum bill that you can see on the Apple iPad now as thin and light as a device
it's not slippery as one may think but it stays in the palm quite well the only physical area that I didn't like so much was the raised bezel which does make the product feel a little bit cheaper despite offering protection to the screen
it's a bit underwhelming
4 smart phone
and there's more photos on my website as well but now going through the display here and then we'll get into the performance shortly after the screen has a resolution of 1024 by 768 which translates to a pretty low here 160 pixel per inch density now with that being said of course everything can be read and no question
the screen is usable but being honest and upfront to help consumers on paper compared to older mid-tier models by samsung and the competitors on the market resolution or clarity is on the low end
now on the wireless connections available today except for wireless AC GPS and Bluetooth are available but no NFC from my personal experience and those intending on purchasing this for general use it's perfectly fine running today's YouTube Netflix
I did notice more
UX it seems now one of the new features that's evident on the higher-end Samsung tablets makes its way down offering multi window which enables the use of two compatible apps to be split screen for multitasking the efficiency then it works great and flawlessly with the two apps that you have again in front of you but I do notice all other apps that you have running in the background here would pause and or need a refresh when you return now as for overall battery use
I left this playing a video here at 50% volume the entire time really just leaving Hausa cards on the entire night's episode after episode and the tab a lasted nine hours and ten minutes till it died that as for more casual use
that tablet survived five days and five hours with a total of 8 hours and 49 minutes of screen on time now that's periodically just using it throughout the day here just checking on social media
email the weather
let's say and it's
I'll be honest
it's not too bad at all just for casual use but concluding this and trying to be fair where it does count but putting some of the numbers and experiences into perspective here this really does feel like a lower end model
it's very portable
the battery seems decent

this is it
there's plenty of layouts that you can print out but none of the immersion hours after i have tried the hcs voice control system which works really well and even allows you to install celebrity voice packs so that when you issue a command someone like william shatner or one of the other crew members will be the voice of the computer responding however
i hadn't yet tried
this is game
it sounded fantastic
it has various modes available so you can reconfigure it from simple flying mode to combat to exploration and it even has a live data feed you can see the tablets responding really well and it gives you a really incredible immersive experience when playing a game not only available for elite dangerous but they also support star citizen
glass work brilliantly
and the power button
let's fire up netflix
netflix works fine
i found exactly the same with amazon prime very smooth interface and no issue with playback at all but what about gaming because that's also a problem area for low-cost tablets
and they're okay but they sound a little bit tinny and a little bit painful at high volume i make use of a service called really which is basically netflix for magazines and that looks great on the tablet you can browse through swipe through and i'm very impressed with how responsive it is
i fired up

he went
we have
ooh this cool
we have this glove
that's very cool
that it comes with one of these usually have to buy these separate and then it has a thank you card and the installation disks it also comes with the pen which is securely taped down in there so it doesn't move around it is a very nice sweet pen
we have the pen holder and it comes with four replacement nibs and the pen clip on the bottom the susi screws into the bottom part like this and you have a pen holder then we also have the cable for the tablet
my last tablet took about two hours to set up just because I could not get the pressure sensitivity to work but thankfully this tablet was super easy to setup
I think they work very well when I press lighter on the pen my lines got thinner and when I press harder my lines got thicker it also has 8 Express keys which is very nice most tablets around this price range only usually have about 2 Express keys
I did try
I was really surprised how easy it was to set up all I had to do was take the Yi little USB um port out of the back of the tablet and then I put it into the computer and then I switch the tablet into wireless mode by switching on the on switch
I was really happy
I did notice a little bit of lag when drawing in Wireless mode it was very little and usually only when I would do a ton of fast quick movements but it was very minimal and hardly noticeable at all one thing
I did find interesting
is that the
I thought this would be a Hindi parents and that the pen would be dying on me when I be in the middle of drawing I thankfully that is not the case
this tablet comes with Android lollipop built in and a few HP apps to get you going in terms of spec it comes where the Snapdragon 800 processor 2 gigs of ram 32 gigs of storage
it's not full
HD of course
it's it's great for content viewing and it works wonderfully with the notes and the pen that comes built in with it which we'll talk about in a bit in terms of actual connectors
you've got docking station
Play Store
it's not bad
it's it's pretty good for creative types and to kind of get you going so as you can see you can change particular stro types and different colors etc from that in for the full version
there we go and of course you can choose different colors different pen strokes etc and the other thing which you are a bit more interesting is going back to choosing capture book on the paper notepad what you can do now with the HP Notes app is get your pen pull out the tip turn it around
at first
the paper notepad quite close to the tablet and preferably with the hewlett-packard logo next to it rather than this side which it doesn't seem to work and if we just offer it like that right so with the magic
it's actually quite useful and I think this is one of the niche reasons why someone would buy this particular HP ProLiant Ablett for note-taking and I would say that it's a good screen good size twelve point three inch screen as I said earlier for content viewing and also note-taking as we know you can of course use Microsoft's OneNote app instead of the HP notes and it's pretty good I would say in all would I buy it for that reason
I think there are slightly better ones out there like the sampson and ipads which will be a bit better in terms of general performance in terms of if you wanted it for kind of the artistic the note-taking the big screen

if you want a high-end tablet it offers all the bells and whistles the Sony Xperia z4 tablet should definitely be on your shortlist being one of the thinnest and lightest high-end slates
to look at
there you go
it's nice that you can now double tap to wake the tablet from standby even though you still need to use the power button to put it back to sleep with the most powerful
it's also the only high-end waterproof tablet around unfortunately sonic has priced it quite steep and it's easily the most expensive 10-inch tablet on the market right now but if you are after a slate with a no compromise hardware that will readily take a dip in the pool
is its screen
IPS display on here 10 inches touchscreen of course because it is a tablet really really nice to look at and especially nice to read text on it's 1920 by 1200 resolution which gives you 218 pixels per inch when you pack it into something this size so it's really good for reading text because you're not going to see all the jagged edges of the text or any kind of pixelization and a nice thing too because it's got just a little bit more resolution than a standard 1080p display is that it's a little bit wider when you're in the portrait mode so if you're looking at newspaper articles or something there's a little bit more text on the screen and it's a little bit less constricted when you're in portrait mode now
that's a quad core chip at one-and-a-half gigahertz and it's perfect for the things that a casual user would do reading you know websites doing some email watching some videos but some of the higher-end games might struggle a little bit on here the casual games
put your media on there and not take up the internal storage has Wi-Fi of course because that's the best way to use it if you want to get on the internet supports a GB and n networks and it also supports five gigahertz Wi-Fi also and it's been working great here in my house has bluetooth for wireless devices and you can also plug in devices into its charging port here this is a USB charging port and it supports the OTG protocol
you can buy this
$2 cable on Amazon and be able to plug in keyboards game controllers and other things into it also so it's not too hard to add some other devices to it either wired or through bluetooth you have the volume rocker switch
Dolby thing on there so you can adjust some of the the equalizer settings and whatnot to try to get the sound a little bit better but audio quality isn't the best out of here but if you plug in a pair of headphones it will sound pretty well so let's take a look now at its performance now as a device that is geared towards casual users
it does the things that casual users do quite well so web browsing is fast and responsive on here things really do pop up very nicely very quickly and the pictures are very sharp too with the display here
now it's in the desktop mode so usually it'll default to the mobile browser which is a little bit faster so pretty nice performance for web browsing YouTube and things like that like Netflix are also pretty responsive too so we can pop up a video here maybe go fullscreen with it
and then we'll pop open and make sure that we're running at the full 1080p resolution is to make sure yep so as you can see the videos come up very quickly
it has a faster processor but it is good enough and this is the kind of performance you can expect out of most of the casual games out there again when you get into the higher end stuff
but this kind of game is really the type that you should expect to be able to play on it and for those of you who like to emulate old game consoles
I found the tablet does very well with the Sony Playstation on backwards so it doesn't do the Nintendo 64 very well but you can certainly run the PlayStation emulator here this is FPS CISC
I believe and everything back from there so the old 80s consoles and everything else will work fine but anything above the PlayStation is a little bit problematic but as you can see the PlayStation runs
Wii is a test of its gaming prowess and it scores nine thousand two hundred and fifty seven so that'll put it well above some of the cheaper tablets that come in under $100 or $150 but puts it a little bit below what I saw on the HP stream 7 which is an Intel based Windows tablet but that one has a smaller display and less battery life
I've been using this thing all day really hitting it hard volleys benchmarks and games and web browsing and everything else and I'm still over half of the battery left so I think you're going to get easily a full day out of this thing if not more certainly on par with what I've seen with other tablets weighs about a pound so not very heavy and I think for a casual user
this is probably a good choice and the display for sure is its best feature and I think certainly really nice to look at even for long periods of time this is LAN Simon
thanks for watching you
screen tablet hello
now what happened
please take me back
Courtney baby come back
what the heck
that'll be handy however
I checked the huion website to see what was up and the stand costs extra what the Gaumont tablet had a stand prepackaged with it at its regular price and it was still cheaper than this tablet
Chaos Emeralds
I streamed a Twitter
kind of like how
I drew her shoes normally cuz I like them the way they are but then I added leggings under her skirt with the knees cut out after adding the tails and the facial expression
was this golden blonde
the color shifted
SNT reference made her eyes red and that was kind of cool so I took inspiration from that and made her eyes pink instead that way it matches that sort of special aura that SNC has in S&T forces I even added little sparkles into the guys and well almost off-camera
one is a micro usb and the other one is the usbc and i actually forgot to pull out the pen case which i actually thought that it was part of the packaging but it turns out to be a holder for the pen
so sorry about that
there are four express keys on the tablet which you can customize when you download the driver and at the bottom of it you can see that there are four rubber studs or rubber feet
the artist club
here is a picture of all the things in the box so feel free to pause the video if you want to give them a good look and yeah let's move on to the actual review
i often use my computer and ipad when i draw so i didn't draw with my phone at all and i had to test it with my pc instead before i actually tested it out
i will try someday
it's pretty affordable as well so if you plan to get this tablet i'll be leaving all the details in the description box below actually gamma will be having a seven day deal starting on january 11 to january 17th
if you're interested
peace out
i'm not okay
well the tablet tablet
what is your problem
Yan a spheroid
there are the driver
CD and manual before you install the driver make sure you uninstall all other drivers and it is best to download the latest driver from that website this Bob collects order cables
and also this trackpad
here because this is wireless it does require charging it has an inbuilt battery inside and it charges true this USB type-c port here the charging cable is provided of course this is the numer USB port but this is the type C port here
it's already on
there are some blemishes
which means it doesn't have a razor because the charging point is right at the back of this pen the feeling of using this pen and nip while drawing on the tablet is no different from drawing with a
you just plug this right into the back of the pan and plug the other end of the cable into our normal USB port to charge Japan battery life for
this pen is good
I do not have a number for you because it really depends on how often you use this pen for drawing but generally speaking the battery life or of the we own pens that I have tested
I have already switch this on when it's on there is actually no indicator light but when you move the pen over the drawing surface it will light up now using Mac OS and this is the drivers dialog box in Mac OS so let me go through some of the settings that you can change so here when you click on it
the next tab here is for the stylus pen you can assign shortcuts to the two buttons on the pen you can also change the pressure-sensitive curve and this is where we can change the work area
so if you are left-handed you can actually just rotate this 180 degrees if you want to you can relate to 90 degrees as well or 270 degrees depending on your depending on the type of work that you are
I'm not able to test all the drawing apps that are available out there because I don't use all of them now this is running on Mac OS 10 point 12
the tablet supports micro
I've tested the tablet on may who has ten point nine and I wasn't able to see the driver dialog box and today I'm not able to show you Windows because I do not have any Windows computer at home if you want to read about all the drawing apps that I have tested
I have the pen selected and let me try and draw some strokes it seems that pressure sensitivity looks quite well the strokes they are able to taper very smoothly there is no lack whatsoever and this is not very different from drawing with a Wacom tablet the strokes are also very smooth
there is no
I have to say that this demonstration is working well now but I have faced certain issues like when I start Photoshop when I try to draw dots will appear
so that's great
all right
Tai yasue sketches Pro
this chief looks fine
the lines are smooth
no jitter at all
I want to test the trackpad so I want to see if I'm able to zoom with the trackpad to rotate and to pan around now Media Bank pane Pro is an app
it will
rotate very intuitively
we on tablet alright
it's not working very well - so when I'm zooming it seems that you wants to rotate the kembers and I'm not able to get it to zoom properly each time so it doesn't work well for zooming - and now s flip over and the last thing I want to test is the tool finger-painting mode so it's not working at all so this is not working so basically it's a fail
the trackpad is basically not very useful here and having this track that means that you will need to use an app that actually supports the trackpad but for apps that are using right now
let me try
and let's see
I wasn't able to show that to you earlier on because I seems to have no problem but let me try and do it again so I'm going to pick a pen and try to draw quickly
let me increase the brush size to see if it changes anything so yeah so sometimes it would have this problem let me change a different pan so yep so earlier on
let me go back
they all look fine
there are issues on
it doesn't work
I wasn't able to move the cursor with the pan so it doesn't work with mischief and there's also this strange thing that whenever I click a button on the taskbar it would recognize it as a click and hole when I click on a button at the taskbar
so this area here is like wasted space and the most important thing is it has quite a long box and Driver issues with various drawing applications so I had a rather challenging time reviewing this tablet now for most other of my own tablets that I review I can review them quite quickly because there usually aren't a lot of issues but I took a much longer time
for the price this is the tech glass p20 hd if you have a spare 100 pound or 100 and you're looking for a tablet then this i think is perfect
normally you just go full white or full black but then mix them together and obviously you also get the tablet and a user manual and some leaflets on the left hand side
we have power volume
do people actually use tablets nowadays also the ipads are rather big and they do use them but after using this for for a few days i can see a need for it
obviously the games look great as well on the the big screen 10.1 inch but it can be quite a refreshing change from looking at your smartphone all day and holding that anyway in terms of performance this holds up really well running android 10 so it is the latest os which is good and it does have a security update from june
that's pretty good
uh just over four hours nearly five now the other great thing about this is it has a sim tray so you can use 4g sim card in here if you wish
and depending how you have these positioned if you have it whacked up really loud resonates off whatever surface it's on it can be quite ear piercing and you have to turn it down a touch
obviously not very good quality and again on the front as well i think for me key is performance for a tablet and obviously battery life as well but for performance for me
this is great
there will be links in the description below if you want to take a look as well and it's your typical sort of design as well with these um budget tablets that you see um quite a nice sort of effect looks metal but it's actually plastic
So you guys may have seen the remarkable tablet that I've been sort of sharing in a few videos and I've had it for about Two months now, and I've been following the company for quite a while now I think I first saw them on Kickstarter and was pretty impressed
And the main reason I wanted to review here on the channel is because it's as I said, it's this weird combination weird between Analog, you know paper to some extent and digital.
So for example like to duyst and notion, etc it's sort of like a Middle ground and of course, there's going to be many people in the comments You know Asking me how it compares to iPads and other details like that and I'll do my very best to come to that at the end
How does this?
I'll talk about some of the accessories near at the end and actually, it got a little bit scuffed you can see the scuff marks and Naturally, that's a bit of a pain.
It works very well.
It sounds like paper.
Feels like paper
there's also this home button at the top or On/off button and you can hold it to go into sleep mode and you can hold it for longer to turn off
But maybe that's because I've been connected to the Wi-Fi that it has inside of it, so I probably get about three to five days depending on how Aggressively I use it.
I would say that if I for example used it for a couple of hours in the evening which I typically do these days because I I'll explain my opinion here at the end of it
Let's talk about this
twelve pound which twelve dollars which is fairly high for paying for nibs, but Again, something to note down when you're purchasing this now inside of the software itself You can do a range of things now.
So that it syncs and you can see your for example your notebooks and notes on your Mac or Windows or You can upload PDFs or files that you want to annotate on the device and I've done this a couple of times mainly for like Two guidance documents for the house and read them on here
The one thing you can do is when you get set up, you can create these three areas and they're called folders naturally Notebooks and inside of any of your notebooks.
you get to change your type of pen and the pen can range from anything from ballpoint pens to fineliners to markers to pencils to paintbrushes and Highlighters as well.
I haven't used it yet, but they do stay it's in beta and I believe that means you can see on your PC or your Mac a Live view of what you see on screen?
There's thing called layers
You can change the template add a layer move a layer around so you can maybe add this different layer of Sketching if you're from example an architect They do promote that a lot that this is more for thinkers than it is necessarily for folks like myself And you can also go and set it to landscape view as well as see a page overview or create any new page at any given time now one thing I started doing from scratch was I Obviously just started just getting stuck in with it.
So I pretty much created a bunch of notes that I didn't necessarily use Massively so be careful when you're starting if you do because the notebooks obviously you can get carried away
I've got now which is I pretty much just like active notes for content ideas and thoughts and things like that and Projects which a project-based notebooks for example, like house and business map
PDF ebooks and favorites
You can change your account details you can change the Wi-Fi you're connected to you can see your power and some of the battery saving abilities and also storage which is something
you don't really need to worry about storage that much unless You're uploading soup super-heavy pdfs to this device for example, I've only used 0.39 gigabytes of 6.5 gigabytes, so I doubt then I'll have to worry about Reaching that storage limit anytime soon
I've been getting already
I just like that
But then at the same time it is a bit steeper than I thought and I'll talk about that in a moment so one of the questions that I mentioned earlier was why not just buy an iPad and iPad does all of this and more and why this is different is because It's more of an offline tool.
With an iPad
You'll go you'll get tons more value getting an iPad and you could potentially get something like take paper-like Which I know ali abdel uses to add on top of your iPad to make it feel more paper-like But that sort of defeats the point of the tablet itself.
it doesn't distract
I'm getting from new
folks is like
But what you don't get with that is more of a offline feel is that I guess that touch of paper Then you would say for example with the remarkable So the pricing this is where it comes a little bit tricky to talk about because the pricing is high in the UK it's 449 pound and in the US and in the US the pricing is 499 bucks
But again spiit pricing, I wasn't very happy with this pricing if I'm honest believe for the same amount of pricing you can get and a basic iPad the 128 gig model and you could install the paper like and display on it for the same sort of price
It's definitely look
So, let's see.
Thank you so much for stopping by if you're new here to keep productive YouTube channel, please do hit subscribe also, if you enjoyed this video folks like it because that helps more and more people to discover it and also naturally gain a good review hopefully good review of the remarkable tablet
and if you're looking at it maybe you can comment as well and Sort of share your thoughts and maybe I can fill in any of the gaps in the comments but folks
Cheers, everyone. Bye
right now
included in the box
is the tablet itself
the pen which does need an AAA battery in order to work which is not included a 1.5 meter USB to mini-usb cable why I made a decision to use mini and not micro
moving the pen to the cursor on screen moving if you want a comparison a gaming mouse usually has around one thousand polling rate the resolution of the tablet itself is about four thousand
not that high
but there shouldn't be any problems you can however if you want extend that a little bit if you hover by removing the name of the pen now let's take a closer look at a pen itself
it's the one thing
this makes the pen a bit heavier than for example the Wacom pens which doesn't use any batteries but it also brings a little bit of customization to the pen in the way that different batteries weigh different amounts
I noticed this myself when I started playing with the tablet because first I used a really heavy battery and then that stopped working so I used a real light one and I had no idea what happened first why I was playing so bad
well I get
it's very compact
it has three buttons
it doesn't really make any difference in aiming though at least not when you have constant pressure but it does feel a bit weird now until the tablet itself it's nice and compacted
it's really clean and nice one problem that comes with it being very small though is that might get hard or uncomfortable for some people to find a place to rest their hand and if you don't have anything to all have all the edge with it can pretty quickly become even more uncomfortable and yeah it can be a big problem for some and well a small for others
that is the tablet
it's something I've never really thought about before what I've used another tablet but dragging on this tablet makes quite a loud sound if I compare it to what I'm used to and yeah you just listen here
not detecting the tablet which led me to having to reply get several times opening closed the drivers and so on half the time it would start spamming the popups that the program is already running and the other half it would work and actually open up
it does let you customize what the keys do to 100% which is very nice all from paving like mouse buttons to is simulating all the different keyboard buttons including combinations with Control Alt + Shift and you can even just make them not do anything at all which can help some good types and also surprisingly enough something for the people that draws and it's just something small to change brushes in the programs they used to draw but it's pretty cool and then comes the pen pressure test
if you want to find a new comfortable area you will have to go by trial and error if you come from another tablet and want to replicate the same area
if you did there will be another review coming soon and also after that some totally different kind of content from what we usually post so hopefully you look forward ads bye
jeez you already know
that's right touch
i use the tablet to animate over the footage i took i was going to animate me getting chased by some monster or some next edgy but i ended up just using my panda mascot thing by the way his name is bambootie get it cuz uh
see y'all later you
comm and here are the best 8-inch tablets you can buy right now before we start as I said I reviewed pretty much every 8-inch tablet except for one and I will get to that one later you can find my reviews in the description below
and then you can also find a link to my next tablet comm where we've got a list with the currently best 8-inch tablets out there so even if you're watching this video in a year from now or even longer you can always find our current recommendations in that list in the description below the best 8 inch tablet
screen and it has an aspect ratio of 4 by 3 which is not ideal for movies but which is a very nice aspect ratio for reading websites with or to read books with them so on it has a resolution of 2048 by 1536 pixels
I'm always looping an HD video locally at medium brightness and activated Wi-Fi and that goes for all of my reviews yep at mini v does have a metal body and
Mini design was pretty big black bezels around the screen so it does feel very high-end and it is where we where did it just doesn't look as modern anymore
ID fingerprint sensor which works fantastic and you can use the iPad Mini five with the first Apple pencil so the original Apple pencil as you can also use with the iPad air or this than that iPad and the Apple pencil works great
of course
that's quite multitasking
it's only real
downside is the design
I did not review because you can only get it in China or through import shops in most countries at least so I did review the huawei media pad m58
then if you're getting the immediate pad m6 8 which has the same screen and the same body by the way you will get the Q in 980 which is a bit faster
we're getting a full metal body here which feels very high-end and it looks much more modern than the iPad Mini 5 it also has 2 USB C port and 2 pretty good speakers
Pat m-68 is running Android n9 but because of the sole of us-china trade was saying you won't get it with any Google apps you can install some of them but Google is actually not recommending that
if you're in the market for a very premium tablet the next tablet on this list is the Samsung Galaxy Tab a 8.4 2020 which I did not review yet
you're watching it and yeah it looks very promising and it is certainly next up on the list as long as there's no huge issue with it the next step is that
it hasn't been released in Europe and it hasn't been released in the United States which is really sad because when I review that I really enjoyed using it it has an 8 inch
IPS screen with a full HD resolution of 1920 by 1200 and it is a pretty nice screen it's running in Exynos 7,000 v processor which is a decent middle-class ship that is supported by three gigabytes of RAM
it got nine point five hours in my standard test and it does have for plastic body but it is quite well bird and it does have a USB C port no fingerprint scan although the s-pen is included out of the box you don't have to buy separately and it works very well as we are used to from the S pen's from Samsung
S Pen features that Samsung has been including in their UI so it is running Android 9 out of the box and I'm sure we'll get an update to Android 10 usually the Galaxy Tab
screen with a full
it's running was in queue in 710 processor which is very similar to the Exynos I mentioned for the Samsung tablets you can get it with 3 to 4 gigabytes of RAM and with the 32 gigabyte to 64 gigabyte storage and my standard battery test that cut at one time of 11.5 hours
I like that
it is running
Samsung tablets
I reviewed the HD version which is a bit cheaper both have an 8 inch IPS screen and again the HD version has 1280 by 800 pixel and the full HD version 1920 by 1200 pixels the HD version has a MediaTek a.22 processor which is okay for low-end gaming and you can play pop shamova and so on but only really with lowest settings the full HD version has a bit better p22 T processor from media tech as well you can get versions with 2 to 3 gigabytes of RAM and a 16 to 32 gigabyte storage in my bad retest
it does have a metal body and it feels very high and surprisingly high-end almost similar to an iPad Mini even though it is much much cheaper so the build quality of this tablet
Android there's some minor customizations that you can throw away though you can install or deactivate them lenovo has been releasing usually one update for the high end tablets in the past since this is a cheaper tablet
Networking 429 so again
UI from Samsung of course and as I said in the past the galaxy to have a tablet usually have gotten too big updates and already was an announcement for this tablet to get Android 10 again
I can't guarantee you that if we will get any updates but based on the past it should get around to updates so it is a decent mid-range to more lower end tablet
it's not amazing
I can comfortably recommend is the Amazon Fire HD 8 it disingenuous the cheapest tablets that I can confidently recommend it costs under $100 and under 100 euros and for that it offers quite a decent screen and quite a decent performance so I think if you don't have that high expectations and just want a very simple tablet then this is a pretty good choice
with this tablet it does have 16 to 32 gigabyte of storage and my battery test was pretty good with 14.5 hours now it does have a full plastic body and it does feel cheaper than the other 8 inch tablets
an amazon says it is very robust and it does seem very robust but it does not feel high-end of course it is running amazon's version of android which means you've got fast and direct access to all of the content from amazon including prime video audible audiobooks and so on and the Amazon Appstore however that also means that the Google Play Store including YouTube Gmail Chrome are not pre-installed
unless she's a very computer savvy and yeah you can install those and I always install so Google Play Store on my Amazon tablets but there are some reports that Amazon gave towards a German newspaper
that it might have ruined your warranty so yeah you will be responsible for insulting the place to yourself as I said it's the cheapest 8 inch tablet that I can comfortably recommend and I think it's a great tablet that you can just throw in the back seat in the car for your kids and so on because it is very cheap all right
Rochelle feel free to call me rose rosey Chloe or whatever you want and today I received a tablet from Pablo and so I'm gonna be doing an unboxing video and a speedpaint and a review of this habit so let's just get straight into it so firstly I would just like to say I appreciate how safe the packaging is for this
like look at all this bubble wrap and then it's still like layered with all of this protection and it's still inside the box so it's pretty good packaging if I do say so myself so
this is neat box
I really like this
it's pretty good science
oh here is everything
I ever myself usually
oh this is fun
I've never seen this on a tablet before I assume this is so it doesn't like slide against the table but that's not an issue for me because I'm not one person who just has their tablet on their lap instead of a table so yeah this design actually looks pretty cool
I'm not sure what exactly they do yet but I know that you can make a zoom in and zoom out with these and stuff so that's pretty cool yeah I do really love this design
so yeah basically
this is pretty cool
okay yeah it fits
I don't really find them comfortable so I kind of just draw without but if you're someone who likes these little gloves then it comes with this so you're in luck
it's a little cloth
oh okay so this is talking about like return like we're turning it and like they're warranties so it comes with that kind of stuff which is again pretty neat gonna move this to the side you know so the last thing in this package is the pan which you in this pen
the package doesn't come with anything else so now that I've gone over the unboxing portion of the I think it's time to see how this bad boy actually performs so I decided that in order to test out the tablet I make a relatively big drawing which honestly ended up being too big for my own
the top wood is a really good size too with about 10 by 8 inches of drawing space it also has 10 customisable hotkeys which is really helpful and convenient
it doesn't really matter speaking of the pen it's completely battery free and doesn't require any sort of charging pass buttons on it and comes with eight extra nibs so it will definitely last a long time
I was initially super shocked prior to Pablo I used heel on and while the human has amazing pressure and I was shocked by it at first to the power below tava honestly feels like it's on a whole nother level
I find
I don't even have to switch brush sizes even if I'm using a larger brush size and want a super tiny thin line in fact you'll notice that while I'm lining this I actually don't switch brush sizes at all the pressure
Wisco for this price if not more I found that because of the size of this tablet it was a lot closer to the size of my monitor my accuracy when drawing really improving because of this
I love my little tablets but it's harder to draw on them when the drawing space is only like 6 by 4 inches honestly I used to prefer smaller tablets but this part of the tablet has definitely changed in my mind
I also found that there wasn't any lag at all when I was drawing which is also great another thing that I like is that it comes with a lot of extra stuff for the price of $70 you've got a pretty big tablet
total a pen
I can really appreciate
but don't worry
but it's definitely noticeable
if you don't have any sort of distraction something else that really frustrated me is that you need to completely uninstall all other tablet drivers you have on your computer before you can use this tablet
this is honestly something
my other drivers
this literally isn't an issue for me at all though because I don't really like using drugs laughs anyways but chances are if you do plan using the pump you might have to look into getting a smaller one which I guess is also fine because the cuffs are pretty cheap but again
but it could be if you do like to use the lugs so yeah that's it for the cons and all the cons are honestly super super minor and really
you'll also notice
I experienced no technical errors other than when I fall a download the wrong driver and restarted my computer several times over the span of two hours which was entirely my fault
I completely should have paid more attention to the fact that the drivers clearly said is for the a 6/10 not the a 6/10 plus but yeah the fact that there were no technical errors for such a cheap tablet was a huge relief overall
I honestly would recommend this tablet to anyone whether they're on a budget or not this product is amazing and I'm definitely looking forward to using it for the many pieces I've planned in the future now that I've talked about the tablet
well that's frozen over and suggests that he goes and joins them now imagine he listens to you and finally decides to take a break because of you but something goes wrong and suddenly he drowns
wouldn't you feel the sense of relief knowing that you can go on with your life telling yourself that your brother's death was not your fault but someone else's that's a brief explanation of what makes Don post character arc so emotional while it may not be right to is the opportunity to escape your own guilt
I believe that Don pub is likely using a coping mechanism referred to as projection in which he cooked by placing your unwanted feelings and such onto another person for example
if you're with a friend and your fear of heights is preventing you from doing something you may instead accuse your friend of having a fear of heights and use that as your reasoning as to why you won't do said thing and while this isn't the exact same as Don thought situation
and while
this isn't right
so her mind is trying to make all of these excuses and take all these feelings of self-hatred and regret and pin them on 2j feather instead now everyone knows
J father would never do such a thing to a friend of his or anyone for that matter and knows that there would be no reason for him to do so anyways even don't Pelt knows this which is why we don't really hear about the situation again until it's two books later when don't pump has attempted to give a reason for J father to have killed by himself reinforcing
she is emotionally after
Don Pelt has been burdened with so much more than just the loss of flame tale but the fact that her own advice got him killed which is why she's acting out even more so well take her heart tell us doubling and then IV pull about Don
she later accuses
what makes this scene especially powerful as the fact that Don Pelt is not only trying to validate her anger towards a brother by getting everyone else to believe that that he was responsible but herself if everyone else believes that Jay feather was at fault for flame tails death then she will fully be able to rationalize why her brother drowned and see how it wasn't her fault too
why shouldn't she
she becomes especially aggressive with Thunder clamp and specifically wants to start fights which would make sense because she's taking out all of her anger and self-hatred out on others instead of getting angry with herself
which is why
I think that Don post character was extremely emotional well-written and maybe even relatable and cases so yeah I just wanted to quickly talk about dawn pelt because I find it really shocking
also if you like a print of this they will be available in my shop and will be five dollars off for 48 hours so you want to act fast
I highly recommend you
that's all for now
good bye for now
up top the headphone jack and power button mic whole left side is bare at the bottom is where we'll find our dual mono speakers and flanking that is the USB C port on the face of the n1 you're greeted with your 7.9 inch display and also the fixed 5 megapixel camera
Nokia's in one tablet gives you a 7.9 inch screen at 2048 by 1536 resolution which is a four by three ratio this IPS 324 PPI panel is backlit and according to Nokia
it's a fully laminate
I don't think this will provide any long-term issues but it's something I needed to mention as I found this just by gripping the in one don't let this one negative point turn you off from this display
so makes it much easier to plug in our very own gary sims did a video explanation on USB see so check out the links down below to get more information about it
performance is the second half the nokia any one tablet is a true speedster everything from navigating the UI gaming and even boot up is extremely fast on this device
I was able to get four days of off-and-on usage but keep this in mind that Google Play services will slice into this just a little bit speakers on board
get plenty loud but quickly loses its effectiveness around 75% it becomes distorted sharp and airy also each speaker is a mono speaker so if you cover up one of the speakers you can still hear both channels out of the other speaker it ruins some of the immersiveness that stereo speakers can provide onboard
it's not perfect
I found that works
Android are there
a few settings built into the n1 tablets that vanilla Android does not have additional settings that you'll find a sensor calibration which lets you use the compass to calibrate your tablet Intel smart video which provides smoother video
that just looks bad
it should have a consistent flow with everything being high quality and I think Nokia truly dropped the ball with this one the Nokia n1 is a fine fine piece of hardware but it's really tough to judge without having Google Play services every single application that I threw at it
there are a couple of things out there but every single tablet in the market has a few things here and there if you can look past this flaws the Nokia n1 is one of the best Android tablets out there as far as build quality
Kevin the tech ninja
Android take care guys
so it's interesting
i like the design
here's the pen
it looks comfortable
choose the category
here's the software
the tablet is wireless
let's start writing okay
writing is good
i like it
yes everything is good
i am using usbc
but if you are using a samsung device and experience cursor problems guys you can click the i icon on the right top corner and check the video to fix the cursor problem okay
the target is slim
the tablet is wireless
um yes
i showed you yes
that's it for today
see you next time
hi everybody
home bro
I'm gonna do is to show you every single compartment of this tablet and then I'm gonna open up an app and show you how I work on an app
it's really very nice
this is the on/off button so it's on will be facing the top and then all you need to do is just start it in so once you start it in
you know before the first time you need to sort of pair it up so your tables are know that you know you're using this keyboard and what I like about this is that I can even use on other gadget
you have a on/off button always always turn it off when you finish using it because if you don't do it it's just draining out the battery very quickly and so it takes just a couple of hours of charge but remember to off it and it should last you a good few days depending on how you use it okay
it won't also shake it off because it should sort of stick onto the magnetic cover itself which is really really nice so just take it up and I saw it
if you can see right then let me show you another thing about this cover is that you can fold this cover up and I so I'll pop it up like that
go edition it has a 16 gigabyte internal memory with quick core processor for like quick website surfing quicker pictures you know video processing music streaming and then faster download so it does have able you to expand up to 128 gigabyte by using a micro
SD card
it's either for you to save your file like videos music pictures or you can even use it as a internal storage that allows you to put more in store more apps or saved it heart on to it so the first let me quickly show you so you can see that the tablet itself is relating
and then it's um it's not very heavy way at all and on the top you can see that it's the on/off button and now you got the volume button
so we've got a front and a back they both used to megapixel for for it and then you have a micro SD card slot so this is where you slot the maximum is 128 you can buy SD card to put in here
okay and then you have this for you to put your headphone and then over here is your USB port for you to charge so this is the cable itself so you just like any other plug so you just plug it in like this mixed multi-pane first then place it in okay so you so often put this in starting to use that blue charge
so before you even turn this on you have to charge it for three hours so if you buy forgive or anyone else with you know four kids charge it for three hours
set everything up before giving it to them because they will not be able to set it up by themselves because all you need adults email address you need the Wi-Fi passcode so there's just a lot of things to set up so when you first have it charge it for three hours and then when your initial sets up get your Wi-Fi passcode and also your Google Play account so it
roughly will take about half an hour to set it up with all the updates that if you want to have lots of different games or different apps and it so to put it on because you need to approve it so that the kids were able to use it if you just give it them like this
you can say alarm
it gets different parties so when you set it up you know do whether it's more easier for your child so I did say pattern one so now we go into the main screen and I did a test profile here first and then you have your favorite okay so when you press your favorite means that the favorite apps that you won will appear on here and this is all the not all some of the pre-loaded games here
it's not downloaded it
is all your all
the cure approved apps
put it on
YouTube kids so if you have a YouTube kids app it was of restrict your child but if you put on your YouTube and there's no restriction so you have to be careful if you want to put either depends on your child because I would like to have a bit more
sorry right and so
that's also radio so if you want the user radio you need to put in your headphones because that will antennae and then you can select any radio station as long as you've got the data or Internet okay so we can do that
you got pictures here
I'm going to go to my Play Store and maybe you want to search for some game and then download for free but if you want to buy get because this is linked into your Google Play account so you know you can also purchase it but just if you don't want this to appear on your kids you can just take it off from this approved page
WPS office that comprise of what document Excel spreadsheet and presentation and then memo for you to do it on it's fully compatible with other Microsoft Word Google document that allow you to do your task and then you can print it so let me go on to this one first okay
you've done this okay and then you want to save it so you will save it onto the tablet itself but if you have any if it's too big for you can use it on your mind
which is here
I have linked
I have a wireless printer and I have later sort of they're able to get the Wi-Fi very quickly so I able to print it out through the wireless route
but okay let me show you the touch screen first so for example you can just tap it on the tablet itself or using a keyboard and then again you save it and now you can finish your presentation out and it also have an option for you to save it on the Dropbox
okay let's you know
I first have this
okay just press it and then you can have you go front and back camera which I told you is about to make a pixel and then this is just to take a picture and then that is for you to video it okay
let's go back again
I have to sign it on and then let me just press random sure you can download it but I'm not gonna download it now and then you sort of can watch it on the goals
you can change your avatar over here into that and then that is to assess your pictures for your background if you want to do anything about it at a moment
I'm going to go to the parent setting so I put my password and then our go true so once you put in your passcode it will show you this parental page
you know something like you can just not want them to go here with my gmail to any you know you can just sort of like manage what you want to be up here on the tablet itself
never turn it on
Tuesday you want
and then you got your web access so you can customize it you can put which website you don't want to do as you know to do or the review or approve and then this website filter
okay the customer care is really just do if you have any problem just click it and then you sort of go into your website and then search for some support okay
not the kids password okay and resetting for this one is like your your blue to your network your notification because I have signed on to my Google Play account and I use it very actively so any notification from my youtube for or whatsoever even it will pop it on and what I can do is that I can disallow them from pop it on here
okay again you have to go to the apps and sort of stop the notification or stop your kids able to access that so and if you want you either beast be soft like understand that this notification can turn it off
okay you got battery
life got display
you got volume
it's like this one
is your pattern
lock they only change to a password or whatsoever so you got lots of different stuff here for you to go through so I'm not gonna go show just yet you got languages and things
I have the backup because it's signed on to my Google Play account so any pictures it will back up into my Google account so which is quite nice because or you can set it to your Dropbox or your club
where is this location
which is quite nice
Google Play Store which I believe that if you have an Android phone you will have a few apps that you have paid for whatsoever that you can even use it
you know because it's soft link so you saw it's a good place for for you for adults and for children because this tablet was sort of grow with them so it will have this hum they can do work here they can play here they can watch movie here
is it all right or is it not all right okay so I can see like oh I keep using mine so you can write so this and then it will give you all
it's all that grow with them because you because according to your age they sort of adjust accordingly to what week they can access and what they can't access using this tablet so um I love that you know this
I hope I had answered most of your questions but if you do have anything regarding the tablets do let me know pop on my comment page and I'll get back to you as soon as possible
so bye for now
the huion kamvas 13 is kind of the perfect tablet for those who have been bugged so far with the massive sized display tablets but like every other product out there
wh1409 v2's pen.
holder that now comes with a rubberized circular ring on its base this time and because the standing tips get tired all the time huion made sure to lie them down this time.
the loop of life.
use the phone charger
it's actually good that the display tablet needs fewer ports to connect to my computer was easily able to run it without hooking or taking the trouble of the third red labeled usb port or connecting it to anywhere else lesser wired connections are always the best experience one would want from whatever device you are using.
in case the first usb cable and the hdmi can't turn on the display tablet and see if it works for you and if by chance even then you are unable to turn it on just sacrifice
then you would only need one connection either way and that will be sufficient for the device to power on which is actually excellent, but sadly there is no usb c to usb c cable in the box, i think the company knows that not many users wouldn't have a device that already has a usb c input with those specifications on their laptops or on their pcs.
i'm sorry about that.
or am i not.
or am i.
so make sure you know that the usbc on the bottom is for the single usb c able transmission and the upper usb c worked in my case with the three-to-one cable provided in the box.
it's about 980 grams
mm in thickness.
the screen is full
but that's just me.
finish on it.
it restarted
also if you ever want to use this tablet as just a pen tablet and not a display tablet you can do so by powering it off and reconnecting it to the laptop by a usb cable to activate the pen tablet mode.
this might just save your battery on the laptop if you would ever want to do that or in case you ever get stuck in a situation or adventure where there is no power but somehow you were creating stuff on a tablet hooked to your laptop.
now just imagine the convenience of not plugging the tablet in a power outlet and saving you an extra effort of going through all those extra cables and if you have a compatible pc or laptop with that usb c to usb c cable then just imagine that convenience.
well many do love using these few shortcut keys on the tablet themselves and do not bother using the keyboard but i so far have failed to replace my keyboard with the tablets or any tablet shortcut keys.
then why bother.
yes many wouldn't mind buying a usb c to usb c cable as it's an optional accessory and many wouldn't even have that compatibility on their systems but the tablet should definitely have come with a stand.
slight screen variation.
sadly i get these for only a couple of weeks or so, so can't promise a long term review which would have been best for people buying this after a few months since this video goes live, hope all of you are staying safe, hit a like and sub with the bell if the video helped you.
that's all for today.
welcome to Greg

Android this is just a little card that gives you some information on how you can contact them and give them suggestions or if you're unhappy with something to reach out to them inside here we're going to find the rest of what comes inside here and that is a micro
so the matrix
Annika it's pretty bright for such an inexpensive tablet at the bottom or you don't have any ports on the side on the right-hand side you get volume up and down
SD card slot and then the micro USB charging port and that's pretty much it and then you're left with the tablet at this point so this tablet is going to not be a speed demon
this one actually sounds not too bad and the performance on this one is also pretty good with what you for you know like this this type of gaming and stuff not bad at all and I'm playing like a freaking beast right now can I be stopped
there's no slowdown
oh there you go
YouTube for instance
I'll tap it so once it starts playing and I'll put the volume on in a second but you can play it up to 720p 60 and it does perfectly fine with that
volumes maxed out doesn't sound super loud but it's loud enough to hear it to consume it and it doesn't sound that bad either one thing to keep in mind
Netflix real quick and I'll play the office for a second and I'm not gonna play too much but you see it does play and when it does play it doesn't seem to play in HD so keep that in mind but it's definitely clear enough to watch it and enjoy it anyway and then Disney
so you're seeing
so you
I think that's kind of weird but it does have a camera and I did take a photo or two and video if you want to do video or photos just swipe in from the left to the right and you can switch between the camera and video it can also go into settings and in settings you can go into resolution and quality and you can switch the back camera to lower the megapixels
I can said I'm not a huge fan of taking photos on this kind of stuff but you do have the ability to do it so let me go into my photos
here's a camera
hopefully you can see
here's another one
here's another one
kind of orientations
a little bit off but came out okay and then here is a video so recording videos photos you can do it with this tablet and also if you want it even does
battery life would this
so that's definitely enough to download games apps video watching videos all that stuff on there and then there's also some nice little tweaks in here as well if you go into the navigation bar you can go in here and you can choose you know if you want the back button on the left or the right can also choose this button right here which you can see
were able to bring down those quick toggles as well and you can press it and we'll go back back and forth real easy for you and then just jumping around
it's pretty good
Android Android 9.0
Iles website which I don't give that much love to sometimes about load that website up just so you can see how it does with web browsing and the websites loaded and you can see
thanks for watching
oh hey i'm mark
let's check it out all right so this is going to be my complete review of the canvas 22 studio which is a tablet computer by huion and uh basically what happened
huion contacted me and uh they asked if i wanted to review the device and i said sure why not add another one to the tablet collection but so this one is going to be a little bit different
i've also tested zbrush to see if there was any potential for 3d with this and to be honest i've been pleasantly surprised so i'm excited to share my review with you guys but first let's open up the box and see what's uh what's inside what you get for your money
and then we'll discuss
who is this for
because i didn't have any spare ones so i wouldn't have been able to use the tablet at all without this so nothing super fancy just needed some batteries and ready to go so in the first box here
you know like the rest of the device and then of course we get some miscellaneous documents a little washcloth and a smudge guard very nice addition and then of course the entree the tablet itself so it looks very similar to a canvas 22
but i've been told by huion that this is not the same as the tablet that they sell individually this one apparently uses a custom panel all right and well here we have it the tablet itself and as you can see here from the reflection the glass surface definitely has a little bit of texture to it
so we're going to have a bunch of ports so not super you know not super next-gen but we got some some basic stuff here with enough usb ports to uh to do the trick and allow us to plug in pretty much any peripheral that we would need to but as you can see from the size of it
i asked for that version because i wanted to try and do a little bit of 3d with this machine and we'll see how that went a bit later and in my case i have the 240 gig ssd version with an extra one terabyte regular hard drive plenty of space
just yeah it just got to do its job and keep this thing from melting which it did and here we have the final score so 3600 if we see a comparison here you know it's going to be below recent gaming and office laptops which is really what it should be compared to because it's you know it's a tiny computer and it certainly doesn't have the same kind of airflow and you know component space to compete with like a desktop machine or a workstation but considering everything this is not a bad score you won't be gaming on this but in the past three weeks that i've been uh playing with this little thing here i really haven't found myself wanting or needing more power except in zbrush
that's pretty much it
it's almost comical so instead what i did is i just bought the separate sound bar for like 30 bucks and now it's great so let's move on to the actual tablet portion of this review
you get 120 uh srgb gamut which is pretty average pretty comparable to the canvas 22 and most of the recent tablets that i've that i've reviewed so the colors out of the box
they look they look
okay okay to me
one thing that's really nice about this display here is that you have a an etched glass surface that is bonded to the lcd panel so very unlikely that this is going to scratch up over time and the distance between the pen and the actual lcd panel is very very minimal like two millimeters one and a half millimeter
now you might be wondering if this thing gets hot because there is after all a computer slapped in the back and while it does get a little warm towards the top
but uh the tablet stand offers a really good range of motion so you can almost put it 90 degrees standing up and almost flat on the table although when you set it flat on the table it's a little wobbly so probably avoid that position and like you saw in the unboxing you saw me screw in the stand but you could very well mount this on like an ergotron arm or something like that and you would have yourself a pretty bow setup but what about drawing well when it comes to pressure sensitivity here and like the initial activation
everything felt awesome
so it's one of the better tablets that i've tried you know recently that i've reviewed there's no initial activation issue so you can get right from the get-go like really really fine lines and very clean strokes overall
no waviness no jiggliness
nothing just just straight and of course i'm not using any stroke stabilizer that's illegal but yeah overall a very very pleasant experience when drawing when painting and uh the device had no problem you know handling everything i threw at it pretty much in photoshop
that's about 6000 pixels high so decent size but no lag whatsoever which was not the same in the zbrush so i did try zbrush and uh you know to see because it's often part of my workflow so i installed zbrush on the machine and played around a bit and basically you know if you want to be safe
and you can see that it gets a little bit more choppy when it starts to rotate everything when it when it's all visible but yeah that's actually not bad so i was expecting this to be way worse and i'm not sure exactly how much i can attribute this to the fact that i have the 16 gig version 16 games of memory instead of the eight gigs
the lag is definitely tolerable and i guess now is a good time to switch to the negatives about this about this device and one of them is the drivers for example
if you have multiple profiles on your windows device i wanted to have one for myself and one for my kids but that does not work with their current drivers so every time you switch between profiles
and it doesn't look like there's any way to reboot them so you kind of have to just reboot the entire machine which is not ideal however i did point this out to them and they said that they are working on a patch for the driver so hopefully this is going to be fixed soon
yeah aside from that
my experience was very very positive but in continuing the the cons or the negatives about the device it's really going to be more about the format rather than the device itself very pleasant to draw on but all these questions pop now
maybe maybe a canvas 22 and then realize that you would need a computer on top of that and then you know it starts to add up quite a bit or maybe you have a really really shitty laptop
and certainly don't want to go through the trouble of finding a good laptop or a good desktop getting all of that set up and then on top of that plugging in a different tablet
for the ssd the version that i have here is slightly more expensive at 1400 for well for double those stats but everything else is the same and well yeah it
does you know it starts to get a little bit pricey and if you remove approximately 450 dollars from the total which is about the price of a compass 22 series tablet
what you get
if you don't know much about computers if you don't want to deal with that and you just want something that take out of the box you plug in and it just works and well this
is it the canvas
that was a deal breaker because everything was kind of well done sure there are some minor flaws you know drivers the fact that the resolution is not quite there for a device coming out in 2020 they're crappy speakers but i mean none of that
click that subscribe button
do it bro
that's it for me
in 2015
now this is a symmetrical design so if you are left-handed you don't actually have to change any settings in the driver you can just place it on the side of your drawing hand there are
the grip is nice even though there is no rubber here but it still feels quite good good in the sense that it's not going to be slippery because it has a matte texture on it
Box are this
the driver is called
this is where you can customize the shortcuts for the two side buttons on the pen you can only choose from these options here the mouse clicks and is pen eraser
this pen supports up to eight thousand one hundred ninety two levels of pressure and you can change the pressure sensitivity using this slider and lastly we have customization for the Express keys there are only four buttons and these are options you can choose some are predefined for you when you click reset customer defined you can set the buttons to open an application have it mapped to some other shortcuts but this are already predefined for you
it's lagging
and when the curves when they turn this pot here it's very smooth and when drawing long lines like this it seems to be able to maintain the pressure consistently so there is no wavering or no changes in the thickness this is
it just doesn't work
let me know in the comment section whether or not you have any problems with MIDI bang paint Pro but otherwise with the other apps that I have tested they all work fine after a while
our test is with
Windows and put the details the information in my tax review and if I have any updates to this video review all that will go to the text review link to the tech reveal is in the video description below so overall for us $29.99
I think this is quite good for those who want to draw but have a very limited budget or for those who need to use a tablet for some reason but don't want to spend too much money on getting one so this could be that tablet to check out my recommendation
I do recommend you get a larger tablet one days at least hand by 6 inches which is a more comfortable size to work with and Pablo they do sell large it habits such as the Pablo is 6:09 order a 6/10
but before we go ahead and start this video make sure you guys go ahead and click on that subscribe button and hit that like button but other than that
now this is an eight point five inch writing tablet as I said in the beginning now it does come with a stylus pen and the actual board and on the board has the holder for the stylus pen
now a couple ways of using this can be when you get a phone call you guys got a jot down some notes of someone's name address number and all that you guys have the ability to write it down over here as it will save a lot of trees but this is not only something to write down with you guys can go ahead and draw some things or also
just take down some notes if you guys wanna but that's all up to you so whatever you guys can imagine you guys can actually write or draw or whatever you think you guys can do
you guys can do that on here as whatever you guys would normally write on paper you guys can write it over here as it will save a whole bunch of more paper as you guys are just writing on this when you guys have done this and you raised button
the only thing is you guys want to get actual good viewing angles as you guys can only view the tablet when you guys are actually facing it because the angles on it are just really horrible
also the time straight up but it's great but it could be better when showing someone you have to make sure that you're throwing them straight up otherwise they won't actually be able to see what you're doing now you guys are probably wondering how the battery life is it runs on a three volt battery
you're saving a whole ton of trees from just writing on this taking photos and jotting down some notes and all of that just on this one device and clearing it out later on
what's actually really a good use for it and you guys don't need to charge it all the time as you guys will always know that you guys can use it for a very long time before actually having it changed about it now the only downside of writing on this is if you guys make a mistake the only way of you raising someone is actually by hitting that delete key what he raises the whole board so if you misspelled something or had made a mistake along the way of drawing or something you guys cannot erase it so you guys would have to scratch it out and redo that part or having to raise it and start all over
that is one of the biggest downsides of this but again not too bad viewing angles and all that there are some downsides but it's a very good device so in the end guys
if you made a mistake there are some couple downsides but then again you're saving a lot of trees you're writing quicker being able to know that it's temporarily there or even if you guys just take a photo it's always on something and you're just ending up saving some time but that's all for the video today guys
if you guys did liked the video make sure you guys go ahead and hit that like button also make sure you guys go ahead and click on the subscribe button and follow my social media links down below you
created pen tablet
there's a choice
I won't do the photo editing because I use Photoshop for that but I'm gonna download the digital painting and the comics on manga and I'm gonna try the map but in the meantime let's open the box and see what is inside so here
we got a little tab here and we pull that out oh and inside we got the pan instructions and a USB cable so let's undo this back and pull it out a little nametag across the top there which it's quite cute must have a purpose
we've got the pen and that comes out of its little plastic wrapper it does and there's the pen let me compare that with the Intuos Pro which is a little bit bigger and we have the same rocker switch on this
so that's a USB cable to fit in there which is gonna go yep there's the USB that will fit into there you've also got that little thing there so you can put a can of carrying handle in there or maybe even a little kind of lucky charm thing like a phone charm
you can assign to one of these buttons and in fact for any program or app you're using you can specifically design them to that app same with the buttons on the top
Bluetooth as well so if I click that that's now showing it's got battery power all there in there already so it will connect bluetooth or it will connect USB and of course it will charge itself up wireless on USB so you don't have to be connected on the USB cable I'll just turn that off
Wacom comstock in to us and it tells you here on USB take away the cable and press that middle button and then the other sheet of paper you get with it is all that stuff
there are lots of little dots here which are marking out the actual working area and I'm just wondering whether they are in fact pretty much not quite just slightly over one centimeter so it kind of gives you an idea of a centimeter grid
you self-employed freelancer
Pro clip studio paint by standard paint tool for manga by utilizing white comes pen and pressure sensitivity with internal you can draw very detailed and smooth lines by hand clip studio paint
Windows it might imagine it's very very similar this is on a Mac so we've got this little row across the top so now I'm kind of assigning things to the tablet and on the tablet we have got a little row of Express keys across the top and we got two on this side and two on that side and here we can assign any kind of keystroke or anything that we want to it so at the moment this button here if you press it it will equal shift and then we got option we got control and command there so when I press that button it will be the same as pressing the shift key the same as the option key this one sends controlled and this the same as command when you get different things all you know get alt keys and things on Windows one but the parent we can check out the color tip a tip feel so it's a lot it's kind of fitting like I don't know press too hard to get to the Mac if I go too soft that's really easy hardly touching it and that's maximum pressure firm
okay so now
shift shift shift so you could have it kind of option command alt or something like that or mouse wheel or you know you can change it to all these different kind of modifiers
mapping now this means that the now this means you can have the pen just being a mouse across the screen and you can accelerate it so you can have acceleration off
it just stays where it is but if you go really slowly it kind of goes slowly across across the screen but waggle it really fast even and I'm right lit right the way across the whole of the tablet it's not covering the whole screen but if I turn it but if I do it very slowly then it does
so you know it's something you might like to try and then this is the speed so that's going very very slowly and they're making it very very fast to which means it just zooms across the screen noise
if your unforced
then you might get a slight kind of elliptical shape if follow what I mean so the shape of your tablet is not the exact size is not the exact shape of your screen so force those proportions on spring controls
I use Photoshop a lot so if I add Photoshop to this thing up here I think I would like to have the control on here modifier so I think I prefer to have control on that side
I can have a keyboard keystroke where I'm going to do a little X because I know that that kind of top is a toggle keystroke X toggles that toggles things so that will just give me a quick thing I can just press that rather than finding keystrokes or other things like that and that peeking out any programs or apps that you like and you can set these modifier keys up specifically for that program and similarly for that program
kind of look like adverts for extras that you can add on this now if you go online to the clip studio paint official tips and tutorials set on here
and you can see
oh pest pastels
it's like that
I have idea
what is that happening
we've got layers
you can add new layers so and you'll be able to do kind of transparency between layers and do all sorts of exciting things if you want to get into digital art and painting
Intuos tablet pen
I think you know if you are rubbing one thing against another for long enough you will get abrasion and eventually this nib will kind of wear down a little bit so you if it does when it does
you can get some which feel a bit more to feet like a pencil if you want to try those different kinds of knit but you have got those there just in case so the insurance this one comes in this lovely pistachio cut this little
but that's where the pen goes to keep it nice and safe if you're taking it around and traveling these Express T's Keys across the top give you lots of extra control
it's very very neat
you started and it comes with all that great software - which is really professional level software that you're getting there and then once you have got yourself two professional standards of course then you'll be earning pots and pots of money as a graphic designer or something
I recommend it
so that's a very good reason to use one and I think if you're trying to do digital drawing with a mouse it's really very very difficult so getting yourself
one of these will really help you get started in digital painting the photo editing design and all sorts of things like that everything creative is called the creative pen tablet for a reason can
I recommend it
I certainly again
well thanks for watching
put your drawing idea requests in the comments box below and remember to keep drawing or enjoy practice practice practice and I'll see you next time you take care now bye bye
hi this is
and you see we do have a touchscreen here but it's also more than just a notebook it's also a two-in-one tablet so we can go ahead and detach this use finger gestures touchscreen gestures to interact with the device
here you just place it there and it's nice and firm you can pick it up by it but it also detaches just by pulling so hold down on the base and pull and it clicks right out now
the tablet itself weighs about 1.2 pounds and the base is a little base in the tablet together about three and a half pounds so it can get a little top-heavy and if you sort of tilt the screen back you can see that it falls
didn't break so that's good but it's something you're gonna want to keep in mind that you don't want to tilt it back too far because it'll just fall right over
I've used it traditionally in laptop mode and I generally can't get more than five hours of run time out of it when I'm using it to work so you know for four or five hundred and fifty dollars
if you're really looking for something portable you can find other two and one devices that weigh less than three and a half pounds and get more than four and a half hours of battery life but in terms of what you get for that money you do get a device that has much more performance than something with a Celeron pentium or Intel Atom processor
Windows tablet range
HDMI USB and power on the keyboard section here we've got an extra USB port so we've got two full-sized USB ports and nothing else really under the hood of this keyboard
we've got support for screen brightness volume and other things on the keyboard so I don't really have any real complaints about the the keyboard itself the touchpad on the other hand
it's a little weird it's nice and wide which is nice but it's very sort of clack e and you can sort of see that even as I push down on it not only does the whole keyboard itself move a little bit but the device itself is moving so we got a little shaky shake here in the keyboard section as we do that it supports multi-touch gestures we can do two finger clicking and two finger scrolling so those are nice features to have but in terms of precision
I usually like to plug in a mouse when I'm using this device screen resolution it has a full HD screen and I find that sometimes that can make things a little bit difficult to read on an 11 point 6 inch display so
125 percentage resolution
I like to go with the larger option here which just makes everything a little bit clearer and easier to read although can sort of mess up some things as we're seeing so you don't get it to fit as much stuff on the space when you go to this sort of 150% but it it's a little bit easier to read now if your eyesight is better than mine
that okay so we've got a little fullscreen video going here to the high-definition video you can see we got a little bit of glare from the girl glossy screen but things look pretty good from any different angle so no problems there in terms of sort of visual performance now again the biggest problem is going to be that you've got four and a half hours so if you wanted to do a cross-country flight you wouldn't necessarily be able to watch the video the whole way unless you had a spare battery or a power adapter or something with you speakers
they're reasonably loud
but when you do things like in certain apps touch the screen because you wanted to use it instead of the touchpad it'll bring up the on-screen keyboard as soon as you start typing
Windows 8
it's a machine that offers decent performance and neo bit of fine benchmarks and other details as well as more photos and thoughts at little appearing calm but the short battery life the sort of lopsidedness the touchpad which is a little cheap and plasticky
I'd say that I like the 10 inch version better even though it has a less powerful processor in a smaller package I think this two-in-one design is is kind of a winner and the Asus Transformer book series offers better battery life in a sort of similar design
so that's a quick look at this one device the Acer Aspire switch 11 with support for Windows Store apps desktop apps and a core i3 processor this brad'll endure with Lilla buting
it's the latest drawing tablet from hooli on it today we are checking it out on the surface the HS 610 doesn't look like anything special but that is so so wrong yeah you use the included USB cable to plug it into either a Windows or a Mac computer yeah you draw on the surface of the tablet and your lines show up on the screen in front of you
now but the cool thing about this tablet is that is the first tablet that I know of that allows you to draw directly on an Android tablet or phone and maybe even a Chromebook or two
why is drawing on
Android so special anyhow
especially those of you
who subscribe
who are regulars here
you already have a laptop maybe you already have a drawing tablet or an iPad or something you already enjoy drawing on but I think for a lot of people who are just jumping into this as a hobby illustration aren't that sort of thing and want to draw digitally
the price of that is a new laptop or something like that but most people they have a smartphone and so having a tablet that allows you to directly connect it to a smartphone and actually draw on that smartphone
also if you're interested in a drawing tablet like this but you want to see what some of the other ones out there are like I've compiled all the reviews
I mentioned the pressure on the pen about 8192 levels of pressure it also supports sixty degrees of brush tilt now and unlike cool eons older pens this one is a hundred percent battery free that means no recharging or batteries needed
Goldilocks size too
it loves finger prints
some people collect stamps
this collects finger prints
clean again it has these little crevices around the side and around the buttons and they're about as thick as your fingernail and dust loves to collect in there and my camera really likes to pick up dust
sometimes these scroll wheels move way too fast or way too slow so you zoom in way too far or it takes forever just to change your brush size but this one feels good
those are soft keys
they're probably getting away
you might be wondering
nibs well yeah
it will over time especially if you're a heavy drawer but fortunately who is looking out for you you've got extra nibs in the little pen holder there's some along the bottom and there's also a little baggie that has some extra in the box the Pens line quality feels just about right
the pressure comes out
this is gonna cover most of the phones that have been released in recent years you do need to have Android 6.0 or later running on your phone or tablet that's marshmallow for those of you who prefer to measure your os's by sugar content when you plug it into your phone it automatically switches to Android mode
the one catches is you can only draw on a portion of the tablet and have that portion of it show up on the screen since there is no software to install or anything like that there are no settings to fiddle with it
playing around with
A with S Pen
I found some quirks when I was using the drawing programs for the most part it worked pretty well from time to time it did seem to conflict with Samsung's own software that it has installed on there specifically the software that's designed to take advantage of the s-pen when I plug this into my busted up pixel 3
it worked really well
now if you're looking to use something like this only on an Android phone something I would take a look at is another tablet that whoo-hee unreleased just recently it is called the HS 64
Kansai - yeah softly
sleep hurry up
I'm not singing anymore
I was really hoping that I'd never have to use the pixel slate again first of all disclaimer who we are never said that this would work on a Chromebook
I'm just curious
Chromebook this works
I should point out that some of the apps crashed when I was using them while I was drawing on this tablet but I should also point out that some of the apps crashed when I was just using the pixels late normally when I reviewed it a couple months ago so overall what we have here with the HS 610 is a pretty good drawing tablet if you want to use it that way but I think the Android features are really fascinating and it's a cool new area who Eon is exploring
what do you think
that is all
I have for today
hello everyone welcome back to a new video in my channel and this time we will be unboxing and having a closer look at the portronics lcd writing pad and this is the 15 inch version called as the rough pad and this costs just 900 rupees on amazon
where without wasting paper
so let's go ahead and unbox this and we will see what's inside and whether this is useful or not so let's start all right so this is what you get inside the box some paperwork
it's got a 15 inch which is measured from corner to corner 15 inch of this workspace and we also get this nice titus over here and if you have a closer look it's got an erase function over here and if i am right it should have a lock function
and you also have the compartment for the battery over here and we have the patch number or whatever okay and when it comes to the build quality of it doesn't look so premium it's quite thin
it's plasticky and it's got a pretty substantial amount of bezel at the bottom and it's quite thin at the top and the edge and the edges well for the price that you're paying
yeah and let's take a look at the stylus here for the moment and this is not unlike the cheap stylus that you get with some of the tablets or some of these lcd lighting pads which are like thin in size and which and which doesn't feel solid but this is quite good actually
i think this feels just like you're writing on a piece of paper and i forgot to tell you one more thing uh this even has got pressure sensitivity to it
let's see see it's nice and thin and if i press hard this is how it looks so i wouldn't call it like an apple ipad or an apple pencil performance but it's pretty damn good for the price that you are paying right so let me get back to the original aspect ratio
you can practice your circle templates or drawing circles and you can carry this around wherever you're going and you don't have to worry about keeping the sketchbook nice and clean protected at all times wastage of paper and any of these things so even drawing ellipses with varying levels of pressure is quite good
really handy and definitely worth the price and if you're into sketching i would recommend to get this 15 inch version and stay away from the uh you know like they also have one 8 inch version 10 inch version 12 inch
i guess but i don't think that would be so useful because you need your hand to move freely like this so i would suggest to get this one and one more thing i would like to mention
there is quite a lag when it comes to you putting the stylus on the on the pad and then tracking it whereas this one there is absolutely no timeline
so yeah i think this is a pretty good addition to my drawing tool i would say and i would suggest to get one for yourself now if you want to practice your perspective concepts anything like that
i would say yeah and when it comes to the build quality i would say it could have been pretty good and i wish it had a selective erase function right
the stylist had some kind of an eraser where i could just go ahead and erase one particular portion of my drawing but uh i don't think you can ask for much more in this price point
so this is something
I personally wanted to share from the past two or three weeks so I'm gonna do a full review and show you my impression after using it daily for the past two months so I received this tablet on October 14th from huion through Amazon the product comes with great packaging presenting it as a premium product the accessories which you get along with it are a battery free pen
90 degree micro
is the touch ring
which helps you in zoom in or out your canvas you can adjust your brush size as well and you can screw the pages and the other feature is the 12x press key on the side of the tablet and the best thing is you can customize it as per your need the third feature is battery free pen and with 8192 pen pressure which helps you in creating smooth and accurate lines while drawing and the last and most important feature is that it supports
I've been using this tablet for a month and there are some excess which I have done so check out the performance I have done some sketching using this tablet and it turns out really well in the beginning I was little slow but after doing it for one or two hours it become very familiar with me and I started drawing better
I have used dependability and created all of these tutorial that I've worked on this and if you check out this tutorial where I have created this sketch effect so I try to create some sketches using the brush and rest
I have draw
I used to avoid anything that I have to drawing or something stuff so after this I tried to do some experimentation and it really works well so it's not only for sketching and all but it's total freedom like you can do anything with this and after that I did lots of tutorial to create all of this
I edited some photos
the functionality is good
is that customizing options
I use this while creating instead of going to keyboard I press this to use the spacebar and this click for copy and paste in the same way here on top
so that way and this top one is for right mouse button and I think this is really necessary because you want to go to options by clicking the right mouse button so this stop button act as a right mouse
click button so
you find that you can customize the work area as well so if I could fit the full area the whole working here at rectangular section you can draw and write but you can also customize it manually like this so if you want to make it this much narrow or this much big
so and that's all that's very easy to customize this tablet and after this if i go to photoshop and here's I try to do something and just to eat this out backspace and let me show you the sensitivity so I'll go to software again and pen sensitivity so this is the press the center of the adjustment
you can draw thinner lines just by using your pressure and if I increase this pressure sensitivity you can notice that then I compare then to vertex so you can give a little shade like this thin shades like a pencil and then you can increase the shading effect by just increasing the pressure and you see D and and then again reduce the pressure and you see and so this one is for sketching
I think this much pressure sensor is very high so I'll keep it to the default medium and if you reduce it you can see you lose your sensitivity like if you draw
and that way you've got a nice sensitivity so the customizing option has been a really great feature for me and most of my work includes like editing video editing in Premiere and also recent tutorials which you have seen I have edited in Premiere and I edited this using this pen tablet so I just opened one of the file and let me show you the amount of editing I have done in it so you can have an idea how useful this tablet is
so it's like
I'm using more often
I have added to the tutorials so as you can see there are lots of layers so all of my tutorial my recent work and designing work is using the tablet
it's pro level
there might be some feature which you don't get here if you compare with the higher version of the tablet but I think if you get used to it you see that all the basic necessary options are available with this tablet so this is my overall overview of this tablet the only additional feature
and just what
I thought of everything so the first thing I want to talk about is the packaging so it came in a very large box with packing paper and then inside was the actual tablet box itself
there's a brown box
and when you open that you slide out the the tablet box with the picture of the tablet on the front of it and then the top lid just comes off at the bottom and I thought that the packaging was very visually appealing
what's inside everything which
there is a pen
the cable box had a little picture of the cables it came with a a micro USB cable for connecting and charging the tablet and then the the pen charging cable that was inside the cable box
there's five coatings on the tablet so has like a paper like texture and there's four little non non-slip grips on the bottom of the tablet which I thought was a nice touch so doesn't move around on your desk
there's an on and off switch on the side that's mainly used if you're using in Wireless mode and as eight shortcut keys you can customize them and you can also lock the shortcut keys if you don't want to press them accidentally or something it takes three hours to charge the tablet and it lasts 40 hours and it's also a light indicator if it's on or if it's charging now the pen is a PS 150 pen
that's what it's called
who young pens
I don't exactly know how long it lasts but I think it lasts a very long time because it has not run out on me yet and the pen has a good weight to it
it feels very natural
but if you're someone who uses the eraser that's something to consider though it actually gets charged through the back of the pen and has two buttons on it that can be customized to be whatever key you want it to be
it has a weight on the bottom which helps us stay on your desk and not fall over and the pen can go in vertically or horizontally along the two little dips on the top of it and the pen stamp actually has a built-in nib extractor
so if you unscrew the top of it there's like a little section where you can put the end of the pen nib into you tilt it and kind of pull against it it pulls out the pen nib I like about the nib
that way
you'll never lose it
I thought that was a really nice touch and then I got everything out got my laptop out and I wanted to install a driver and I couldn't decide want to use the CD or the one on the on their website but I ended up using the CD and I installed it and for some reason it wasn't working that's because I didn't uninstall my other tablet driver from the one I from the one I used to use then I ended up installing uninstalling the tablet driver that I already had which is recommended make sure you uninstall all previous tablet drivers and then I just installed it from their website but you can use the disk both of them will work he works on Mac or Windows by the way and after installed it I thought that the program wasn't opening but I realized that it was actually in my hidden icons tap on Windows 10 sometimes programmed like to hide in there so if you install the driver and you can't the program will open it's probably in one of your background icons so it was there and from there it was really easy to customize the keys it was really easy to understand how the whole um but like the Huyen tablet program itself is really easy to understand and I was able to customize all the Express keys fairly easily and I just set them to be what I'm used to using like the bottom one I always make controls ed and then it's like control S which is safe and then I just did all that and you can actually have the tablet facing any orientation that you want it to be in sometime left handed I rotated it all the way so that the expressed keys were on the right side so I could draw with my left hand and press the express keys with my right hand no I usually use a glove with my tablets that my hand can glide across the surface nicely I have no problems like honestly no problems with the connecting to my computer
communicating with my computer
the wireless receiver worked very well for me and I've had problems with wireless tablets in the past not really working on my computer that well so this one has been working really well so far and all I have to do is turn on the tablet of my computer and then it responds to the pen and it just starts working really quickly anytime I want to pick it up and draw and I'm just working on a little sketch to test out the tablet
I really like how
it's like a really simple clean design very sleek it feels like a good product it does flex a little bit but not that much has a nice matte finish and it feels like paper
which is it's pretty easy to find this function within the the program that you install when you get the tablet um you can you can make it more or less sensitive and it really has so many layers of pressure sensitivity
they're not the most quiet buttons but I don't really think that matters that much and of course it's a little more convenient to have a pen that doesn't have to be charged but I feel like that's a really small price to pay like it's not that inconvenient to have to charge it it lasts a really long time from what I understand and and you can't really go wrong
it's very sleek
there's no lag whatsoever
I'll try to answer them about the the tablet or anything to do with this video if I hope you enjoyed watching this video and I'll see you in my next one you
Hilla here OS reviews
this is a budget
well we have a quad core processor we also have an IPS display although the resolution is just HD quality it has two gigabytes of built-in RAM and 16 gigs of Filton storage
it's actually pretty dense
it's in full color
setup is the build quality has improved significantly compared to sub $100 tablets from just one year or two years ago so if we look at the base here this is actually made out of real metal so it feels very cool to the touch
surprisingly hefty in the hands and feels actually very quality for something with low-end specs and the top and bottom are still made out of plastic so very similar to a xiaomi redmi device
rare on the tablet even though it's only 2 megapixels for the sensor and we have stereo speakers as well and then on the right-hand spine we have access to a 3.5 millimeter
a power on/off key
HDMI port
that's something I haven't seen in a long time but allows you to connect it to a monitor directly for video output so taking a closer look at its performance starting with you display in general
the plus side is there's less pixels to push around so it's going to be a little bit easier on the media tech ships that here which is a pretty entry-level chip so you're gonna see a less stuttering as a result it's not a laminated display
there's just the standard
is that some of the text and icons are a little on the large side so if we pull down the notification shade you can see that it takes up large width
I was able to get over 6 hours of screen on time with some casual web browsing and some youtube video playback so take a close look at the camera first all I can say is it's functional but it's not a very fancy camera it's probably best suited for scanning and documents
you can still make out all the letters otherwise if you are outdoors it also is okay but if the lights are really dim you can see it definitely struggles a lot more
do get pretty loud
split screen just by long holding on the bottom key here so I can maybe bring up both the camera as well as I take a look at again YouTube on the side here so this is baked into Android Oreo
by default
but in general it still is a good enough experience and overall still pretty smooth when it comes to the general browsing and scrolling around the full desktop version of CNET loading here and you can see
in terms of gestures
you can double tap power key to jump into the camera and for security you can set up your own pin but it doesn't have a fingerprint scanner like more expensive tablets when it comes to the apps you can download any program from the
scrolling still feels quite smooth especially if we keep the apps open to a minimum here in the background whether that's productivity tools like Word Excel PowerPoint for doing some quick productivity on the go
you can connect this to a Bluetooth keyboard and it works pretty well or you can of course download some quick games so I'd recommend lighter titles like stack maybe some puzzle games retro emulators anything
does support up to five points for multi-touch no problems at all in terms of just regular gameplay as you can see here other things to keep in mind is that during gaming it actually does remain quite cool
I think part of the reason is because it has an aluminum construction coupled with a less powerful processor it actually is pretty energy efficient so it doesn't really thermal throttle or anything like that which is great so you can still use it for
I would say it's actually a pretty decent option to consider if you do want something that's low cost but actually has a very good construction quality being made out of aluminum and pretty surprisingly good performance for such a low end device in terms of those specs
this might be something
HDMI port on the top that you can connect using a wire to an HDTV to decrease the latency so certainly is one of the better options as far as budget tablets
that's been our video
thanks for watching
A 6 10.1
inch a 32 gig
it takes a micro
SD memory card
USB charging port so that's totally down said he should had a USB type-c would have been a lot better okay a lot faster charging but they didn't put that on at the back
you can see that that camera there he also has a flash flash blew in as well so perfect for you know doing live recordings or you know doing FaceTime you know no FaceTime by you know video recording and stuff like that as well
inch M screen okay
he also has an LED backlit and display and a fingerprint resistant coating as well also the respect that he has he has a 1.6 km gigahertz octa-core processor between the two gig ram and a 32 gig internal memory
so if you go down you all our features as you can see advanced features like these but it has a 32 32 gig internal memory but also takes microSD memory card up to 200 gig expandable
0 and the basic features or general features he has is a billion speaker with Wi-Fi enabled and you also has a beautiful ambien 3.5 millimeter headphone jack with the mighty wind micro USB and micro SD memory card
you know manufacturer warranty
you also got private mode as well go to go down as both in your general management and here this gives you more a bit more information as well then you go the software of update there and go up
so that's what
Samsung is known for reliable and being having a very smooth operation when it comes to tablets or smartphones and also have a kind of you know electronic says book but pricing is slightly high but this is a budget I would say budget price okay
I wanted to talk about a tablet that I was sent by XP pen which is the XP pen artist 16 displaying tablet and I think this is really interesting because in general and display tablets are well the most well known ones are the Wacom Cintiq at work which are very expensive
I remove that it has a black antifouling glove and it helps the hand from sweating and sticking to the screen it has a cleaning cloth and an HDMI to mini DisplayPort adapter
and all the cords that you need to connect the tablet to your computer and to a power outlet and so this is an HD tablet the pressure sensitivity is 2048 levels and it has a 15 point 8 inch screen and so the price of this tablet is 480 $9.99 on Amazon with free shipping and I compared it to a couple of Wacom Cintiq tablets and the most expensive Wacom tablet
this tablet is 13 inches and it is 798 99 so it is $800 for a 13 inch tablet and this tablet is 16 inches for basically $500 so $200 plus of course there are other
you know how you hold your pen in your arm and a couple of buttons on the writer to turn the power on and off and to increase and decrease the brightness and the painting and I'm painting is just a kind of concept art for one of my original characters be honest
she's pretty new
I know I'll figure out a house and this painting took me about four or five hours and so yeah I think it's a very good alternative to a more expensive
I didn't notice was that I already had a mini DisplayPort so we had to take out my computer and put in a new graphics card not like to replace one
and just letting you know right now so that you don't have to go through the whole hassle of putting in the graphics card in your computer or finding that your computer can handle a display tablet
and then you'll be good to go apart from that installation was simple every you know obviously just clear off the driver for whatever tablet you had on your computer restart your computer
there were really no problems with this tablet so I would definitely recommend this tablet if you are looking for a pretty inexpensive alternative to a Cintiq tablet so I will have a product link to this tablet in the description and this video is not sponsored by the way XP pen was just kind enough to send me the tablet and asked me to get my honest and review for this tablet so yeah that's what I did
if you like this video please give me a thumbs up and subscribe for more if you want to see more videos because I put them out every single Sunday kind of okay
P is actually faster than the C th480 similar to the 420 being at 233 PPS compared to wakens 197 and I do have to say it is noticeable next
Americans out there
four point seven six ounces upon opening up the box we are greeted with a few things the first of which is a thank-you letter from huion and I do have to say this is probably one of its biggest faults but I do believe that is papyrus font but I think I can forgive them if for no other reason than by the cute little mascot
this thing is cute
okay with that tangent
I do appreciate that
it also does have a bit of a plasticky feel and vibe to it but at this price range were not really worried about the aesthetics as much as we are performance
it's lighter than the
we have the micro
USB cable pretty
I'm not responsible
these are mainly gonna be useful if you're an artist type or if you bought the tablet to do art and not osoo or if you're an artist and you play osoo
it's pretty simple
but you can you can doodle around and see what four thousand ninety four different pressure levels is like it's a good way to waste an afternoon and then next we have the work area
it doesn't change instantly
I like it
so that's really nice
I guess keep that in mind if you like heavier pens but it has a nice actual pen grip unlike the XP pen where it has that pill box design or the Wacom which as much as I like the way command how it has that rubbery grip on it
I'm sure there is some there and I think in the very beginning I felt some smoothing but that was probably only because I was adjusting to again like hi well low-level players in the six-digit very high five digit
it's no see th480
keep that in mind but at the same time the C th480 costs upward of $150 at this point whereas this cost 40 and with how smooth of a transition
i think there's immense value in that so if you're looking for maybe a new tablet going from like a 420 or if it's your first tablet and you've been looking for something to buy since you want to move on from a mouse
I'm putting on screen some of the pros and cons that I found with the tablet but overall the pros outweigh the cons immensely so I have to give this a four out of five at least for new players
I hope it was helpful and informative to you leave a like if you want more reviews subscribe for more videos and leave a comment down below telling me why
I'm a bad
Oh sue player
that delivers immersive experiences like Crysis 3 or battlefield 3 with unprecedented portability but by attempting to circumvent the limitations of touchscreen gaming with unwieldy attachments Razer has created a tablet for every playstyle but a master of none at just over 2 pounds and point 8 inches thick the edge is bulky compared to other devices like the iPad but then again traditional tablets aren't nearly as powerful
the design is simple and straightforward with a black aluminum frame a glass front and a plastic body adorned only with razor's trademark snake logo and small indentations for added aesthetic Flair
the 10.1 inch display
it may not distract from the gaming experience but it falls short of other tablets in leaves room for improvement the edge ships with Windows 8 providing access to Microsoft's growing suite of optimized apps and support for traditional desktop applications
it's kind of like razors version of steams big picture mode providing quick access to games in a touch or gamepad friendly interface but it's ultimately kind of useless because in most cases it just reverts to the desktop and open steam or origin
the cheapest model is priced at $1000 and comes with an Intel Core i5 processor four gigs of RAM in videos GT 640 MLE GPU and 64 gigabytes of solid-state storage bumping up to the pro version gives you an Intel Core i7 processor eight gigs of RAM the same GPU and 128 gigabytes of SSD storage
for $1,300 you can also buy additional accessories like the gamepad controller an attachment that snaps onto the tablet to provide two side mounted controllers complete with dual analog thumb sticks triggers shoulder buttons a d-pad and action buttons
but when gaming the edge only lasts for about an hour the gamepad attachment has a slot for an extended battery but that only adds about another hour or so and cost $70 what's worse the edges built-in fans are noisy and the back panel can get pretty hot but the edge also fails to master the most critical element of the gaming experience
you need to strap on additional accessories and subsequently negate the benefits of an all-in-one tablet and even then the edge can't effectively compete with the battery life performance and ergonomics of the gaming laptop
with time and iteration
inch tablet next
this is straight
this episode of hands-on tech is brought to you by aftershocks unbelievably comfortable open ear headphones you can hear music and crystal-clear phone calls like never before visit hot aftershocks calm and use code hot for $50 off the tech bundle
honestly there's been very little movement in the Android tablet space these past few years in some ways it almost feels like a fad that maybe is past but Android by manufacturers are spending the majority of their time on smartphones
these tablets are inexpensive
let's just say this
isn't that review
you'll be underwhelmed as this has roughly 150 pixels per inch which means you're gonna need to get used to seeing those pixels again and jagged edges are kind of the norm some games fare better than others in rendering images for the display and my eyes got somewhat used to it over time
but if you've been spoiled it's really hard going back and I had a hard time determining whether this is a glass panel or a plastic panel on top of the display
I did get used to it but it made me appreciate the feel of modern glass displays however this whole device feels very plastic and that might lend itself to more durability of the tablet ever falls to the ground but like I said everything on this device has flex to it when you bend it
the thing feels rather empty however there in the middle portion that hollowness means that the tablet in general feels less dense than other options out there down on the bottom are the stereo speakers
'ti and that's good to have because the device has 16 gigs of internal storage but the tablet does lack the ability to turn the micro SD card slot into adoptable storage
and that'll help
don't expect much more than a few hours out of the device if you're doing anything more than simple web browsing the tablet offers a 2 megapixel rear facing camera for taking pictures

I think so
no doubt your candy
which is my kids
now you see down there in the navbar there's a little Walmart button that's your portal to Walmart's media options namely ebooks powered by Kobo and movies and TV content powered by Vudu
the box actually includes a $20 credit for the Kobo store so consider that a nice little bonus value and I should also note that my walmart receipt included a $5 credit for voodoo that expired within a month with all that said it took me nearly 10 solid minutes to create a Kobo account on this device full of frustration waiting and occasional app crashes by the time
I got into the app successfully to select the book to purchase my battery had drained 15% from when I started down that wormhole after crashes and stutters had finally purchased starship troopers and got to reading
which is fine
everything is locked in at standard definition on all of my UHD content which is actually ideal considering the display itself isn't HD so this will save on battery and bandwidth the image is passable absolutely nothing revolutionary but
but they run a forked version of Android that keeps Google off of the device with no easy way to install it but they are in their own right better looking more capable devices now since I got the tablet a week ago I did receive a system update that brought this up from a January 2019 security level to april 2019 security patch level
but my guess is
don't go expecting much
and those words right
I say cheap but know what you are getting and expect to be underwhelmed even at this price the on tablet feels more like it's meant to be an impulse buy opportunity than it is a true tablet solution for those on a budget
m106k pro drawing tablet
this is usb a and this is mini usb and the design is not reversible like usb c which means if you are left-handed and you change the orientation of the tablet the cable will be pointing downwards instead a nice soft carrying bag with drawer springs is included artist glove and this is a little pouch for this accessories
this is micro usb to usb a and this is usb c to usb a this material is made of some sort of belt it's quite thick this is the pen case which is made of the same material the pen is lightweight but it feels solid supports up to a thousand levels of pressure and also supports tilt sensitivity
there it's removable
it's quite thin
you can assign and if you are using multiple monitors switch screen will allow you to jump the cursor from one display to another pressure sensitivity can be adjusted with this slider i find the default sensitivity to work just fine
you can expect the same performance with other drawing apps such as photoshop krita clip studio paint so here it seems like the lines they can taper very nicely very gradually
and let's see the line transition from thin to thick and it seems like the line is able to go from thin to thick very smoothly so the transition is very smooth
okay let's draw some really thin lines and now some very thick lines so it looks like the pen is able to maintain consistent pressure when needed so overall the pen performance
it's um it's great
this is clip studio paint which performs really well so the lines are also able to taper very nicely performance is very smooth and responsive because the pen is so sensitive i can actually just choose a huge brush and i can just use that
i have tested this tablet with adobe photoshop illustrator affinity photo affinity designer krita mini bang paint pro clip studio paint and they all work really well the overall drawing performance
it's very satisfactory
i don't use this app for drawing but i want to show you this just to show you that tooth sensitivity it works and the cursor will follow the direction of the pen and tilt and pressure can work together and now let's test the drawing performance on android first thing i want to do is to find out the usable area on the tablet and how it's mapped to the android tablet
so obviously the proportion is off so if i were to write something abcdfg you can see that it's very squashed because this is white but it's mapped to this less white area right here and i wasn't able to assess the area here all right
let me find out
where's the cursor right
okay i can see
it's off so if i were to write some letters for example you can see that it's going to be squashed and there is no driver needed to install to work with android so there are no settings to change
so that actually worked fine however as you can see the performance will vary depending on which android device you are using so this is not a tablet i would recommend if you are thinking of buying a tablet mostly to use with your android device because the performance really varies depending on which device you are using all right to conclude the drawing performance of this tablet
however if your purpose of buying a tablet is to draw primarily with android devices then i wouldn't recommend this for use with android if you want to use this with windows and mac os go ahead
thanks for watching
that's a mouthful but there is a fair amount going on here although this isn't a device that's necessarily going to be matched up with the best two-in-one convertibles out there so your expectations are going to be a little measured here because this is a device that I think is in the more affordable category as opposed to what you would consider elite at least for Windows 10 tablets so this does run Windows 10 home which is great
it's a desktop version of the out of the operating system and that means that you can run desktop apps on it relatively easily but obviously one of the standout things here is going to be the keyboard one of the very reasons why
now it's not backlit so you're not gonna be able to see the keys in the dark like you would with some other units but the keys are pretty responsive they're not as recessed hence why the device itself is not as thin perhaps as some of the other units that are out there in the market but they're responsive and it's fairly easy to type on them
it won't work right
and here's just a quick look at the latch as you can see nothing special there just the basic magnet but pretty sturdy though keeps place and what more can you want right
it's as simple as just closing it up like you would a laptop and that's it so that's how it looks when it's closed and just to point out a couple quick things here so
I mentioned that the window shows you or asks you if you want to go into tablet mode so there's that that visual cue as to whether or not you want to change so if I say yes then see how that the screen changed
HOME key the
so notice here that 72% left 11 hours now 40% screen brightness which is not bad if you're in a darker setting like I'm in here but in brighter light
I mean it's a it not naturally it is going to take a lot of battery up but it is something to consider if you're going to use this for a longer period of time and if you want to go all day now just to show here to go in portrait mode now for tablet
that's this wide again
I don't I don't think that there is any way you can get the same amount of work done with the 8 inch that you would at the 11.6 inch

I'm Teddy K
thanks for watching
we're gonna go ahead and take a look at everything that it has to offer and then we're gonna put it through some performance tests with some retro emulation this is Steve forest al-jihad get started so before we get started
this is a budget tablet and I think their biggest competitor right now would be the Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet so Before we jump into pricing or any of that
the box color scheme is as you can see orange and white and it pretty much just tells you the very basics of what you need to know so on the front of the box
we're just gonna set this aside for just a quick second and we're gonna take a look to see if there's anything else when you lift up the main panel you're gonna see that there's just a couple instruction books in a small little pamphlet that gives you information on the tablet and then over here we actually have a little pocket where they include a micro USB cable and that's pretty much it it's actually pretty light doesn't come with anything really so let's go ahead and take a look at the tablet itself so here we go as we can see
the protective layer off
I would have liked or what you would have seen from a flagship device say an iPad or something along those lines it's not off-putting in any way and it definitely does look fairly good especially for the price point if we go ahead and take a look at the back of the case as you can see
this is one because of cost and two because they're able to get a little bit of the components in there potentially having antennas or things like that where the aluminum isn't going to negatively
it's really clear and it's got really good viewing angles it's powered by an MT 8163 a quad-core processor and it actually has three gigs of RAM which is actually one additional gig than the Amazon Fire HD 10 which is actually really cool
the processor itself isn't a hugely amazing processor but it's certainly not an underpowered processor and we should get some fairly good performance out of it in terms of the cameras we actually have two of them
SD card
we have our micro
we've got our micro
SD card slot
which is going to be used in the event of some sort of data corruption or some sort of software reflashing and then we have dual speakers along the bottom in terms of its battery life
we have a six thousand milliamp battery which should give us about five to six hours of continuous use depending on what you're doing and the different brightness of your screen now based on the interactions that
I had with it
I was running some relatively heavier emulation at full blast and all the antennas were going for both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and I was able to get about three and a half hours so I think my mileage would vary if I were to reduce some stress that I had put on it and I think I probably could have squeezed another hour out of it but generally it's actually pretty good and I'm very happy with the performance so far in terms of the screen
the brightness was actually quite good and you can adjust it to your liking depending on what your lighting setting is in terms of the retail price for this tablet it sells for about a hundred and fifty
when you take a look at all the specs that you're getting and the performance that you get out of it another couple really cool features that are included on this tablet is when you pull down the menu options from the home page on your tablet
iComfort and when you put that on it actually lowers the blue light levels on the screen so it makes it a little bit easier to use later on at night and it'll actually help not to stimulate you in the later part of your day there's also another section called read mode which essentially turns the entire screen into almost like a grey scaled screen very similar to what you would see if you had a Kobo reader or something along those lines
if you're reading ebooks this is a nice feature if you are going to be doing a lot of text reading those are just two really cool little features that were included the software and those are just really nice features to have in the event that you want to use them the matrix pad z10 actually comes with the latest version of Android 9 Pi
YouTube videos
things like that
they all came down
it just simply won't but we're gonna go ahead and see what we can do and we're gonna see how well this thing will run so the first thing that we're gonna take a look at is the Sega Crazy Taxi classic app that you can download right on the App Store if you haven't done that it is essentially just the Crazy Taxi game with ads built into it
this tablet generally speaking
I should mention that
which got me thinking
Super Nintendo and things like that so I've already pre set up my retroarch downloaded all the appropriate cores and we're gonna go ahead and load up a Super Nintendo game Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and it runs exactly like I would expect it to absolutely no flaws
no input delay
so what we're gonna go ahead and do is we're gonna move on to something a little bit more difficult to emulate so we're gonna jump into some PlayStation 1 emulation and we're gonna be using the e PSX e emulator so the first game that we're going to take a look at is Rayman and this is probably my favourite platformer on the PlayStation 1
I have towards it
so definitely really good
Plus app that you can download right on the App Store and we're gonna go ahead and get this thing up and running so the first game that we're actually going to take a look at is Goldeneye which is relatively notorious for not being able to run that well on many different types of devices now I can say I played around with it for a little bit and the footage that I have here is only of the first stage but I was able to make it through without any real issues
I threw on Kirby the crystal shards to see how this plays and the reason I selected this game is because I personally experienced some issues graphical issues with this game on lower-end Android products or other devices so I kind of wanted to give this a gauge to see how well it performed and to be honest
there wasn't any hiccups
dreamcast is the redream
I'm sure depending on the game that you play you will notice it as well but from the games that I test that it actually ran pretty good so the first game I tested was Soul Calibur and I absolutely loved it
the next thing
I wanted to do was compare the app for Crazy Taxi to the original Dreamcast version so I did run the Dreamcast version and it pretty much ran almost as well as the standalone app which is really good
you'll have to experiment to see which games work and which ones don't and you can tweak the settings a little bit but it is workable so you should be able to get some playability out of it to give you another example of a game that ran really well
be sure to subscribe to the channel and give the video a thumbs up and leave me a comment in the comments below and let me know what you guys think of this tablet but other than that
I do want to mention that they also make the new standard version for 2020 and the main differences between the two is the plus has built in wireless charging and three gigs of RAM
Edition with three
you're going to receive a USB type-c cable a 15 watt wall charger which they claim you can charge these tablets up in four hours using the included charger and finally the tablet itself
so here it is
HD 10 over the new 8 version but if you're looking for something with a smaller form factor the new Fire HD 8 might be a good choice and we're gonna get into some testing in just a second but I do want to go over the tablet itself and the specs all right so this tablet does have dual stereo speakers and it does get pretty loud
it's not as loud as the Amazon Fire HD 10 but overall this will get you by moving over to the other side we have our micro SD card slot in this will support up to a one terabyte microSD card
we now have
USB type-c for charging and syncing a single pinhole microphone power button and our volume rocker on the top here so for $100 tablet the plus version is looking pretty decent on paper for the CPU we have a 2 gigahertz quad-core cortex a53
in the standard version they offer two storage variants of both of these 32 gigabytes and 64 but both of them do support up to a one terabyte microSD card now the display on all of these Amazon fire
5.0 it's running fire
OS 7 which is based on Android 9 and prices range between 89 99 all the way up to 1 $39.99 for the high-end 64 gigabyte version of the plus model
so a lot of you might already know that these only come pre-installed with the Amazon App Store and it's pretty lackluster a lot of people want to install Google Play and it does work on the 2020 model here
I followed my old guide that I made for the older Fire HD 8 and it works perfectly so now I have Google Play up and running on this new tablet if you're interested in doing the same I will leave a link to that video in the description so overall the user interface is pretty snappy for a low-end tablet like I mentioned this does not come pre-loaded with Google Play but you can install it you'll get the Amazon App Store and while there are games and apps to download here
Plus Hulu Amazon Prime
Appstore you're not going to get HD Netflix or anything like that on one of these tablets but it's perfectly watchable on something like this now if you want to do Disney
you can use
Spotify on this for your music and that's really how Amazon is marketing this but I do want to test out some native Android gaming and some emulation but first up I want to check out some benchmarks
we got 242
Call of Duty mobile and this is made by $0.10 just like pop G is overall performance on the Fire HD 8 plus is great so I know asphalt 9 has been around for a while but this is one of those games that gave me trouble on the lower end
Amazon fire tablets in the past worked great on the fire HD 10 but the seven and the eight were a bit laggy but this new Plus version handles it just fine and of course we have the test minecraft
I'm gonna go into the settings and turn that off and once you've taken that down and you're sitting at about 8 chunks you'll get an average of 40 FPS even with fancy graphics on running this at 30
I do have the FPS listed in the top right hand corner but this little tablet does struggle a bit with PSP when it comes to get the renamed games here we have Tekken 6 2x resolution
it's trying its hardest to run this at a constant 60 but I get some dips every once in a while which makes it unenjoyable at least for me so I would have to take this down to 1x resolution
I love upscaling these games so I would not suggest this specific tablet for PSP emulation and the final woman here for PSP is a harder one to emulate this is God of War Ghost of Sparta 1 X resolution 2 X frame skip
I've tested so far
but it still can't match the performance of the 2019 HD 10 and if you go with the plus model here with the 64 gigabytes of internal storage it's 1 $39.99 and the 32 gigabyte model of the 2019 HD 10 is 149 99
if you're interested in this 8 inch form factor then most definitely go with the Plus version it is a bit more expensive than the base model of the new Fire HD 8

so there you go
I love that they've actually included a screw driver in the correct size for this eye things I love about the Kobo tablet is the way they've done their letters
I essentially store it with this on there with another hard piece of cardboard on top and a bunch of these Bulldog clips around the side just to stop the whole thing from like totally mixing up because the reality is even when I open this and used it for the very first time
the letters that are missing out of these sheets but the thing is that even if you have a seed especially if you have a 24 word seed not just twelve words seed even if someone has all 24 of the words but doesn't know the ordering they actually can't deduce what your seed is for a 12 word seed that is less true but if you're worried about someone being able to deduce what your seed is based on the letters that are missing from here
I would recommend and I always recommend that you just use the full twenty four word seeds especially because the device allows for it so you can then just store what you don't use and use that next time if you decide to change your seed in the future the other thing that it is important to notice here is the
so these letters aren't going to fade or deteriorate or anything like that over time and that's important to see you because that is not the case for all of these different metal backup so you can get on the market so if you had this from knew basically
hey start is you just undo these little screws and then once you've undone the three screws you can actually slide it open so you basically pop out the letters that you want and you stick the seed in there so for example this was our seed phrase here which is what
the thing you'll notice straight away is actually only enough space for four letters per word and that actually doesn't matter because the bit 39 words are actually all unique
once we're done we just fold the letters in and we get the screws that we put aside earlier hopefully not losing them and we just do them back up and the only thing I haven't seen is some people
you'll hear it
click and feel it
it may be a coded luggage tag or something like that or a padlock as well as long as you understand that a padlock is not going to keep someone out who knows what they're doing and really wants to get in there
I personally found the method of sticking the pieces in and screwing it up to be less frustrating that like sliding all of them in one piece of time in here and having to sort like force them with a screwdriver when they get stuck
cuz if you haven't used a propeller steel before at least in in mine these letters are quite a tight fit and I really take a lot of force to get them in there
little screwdriver does so
original crypto steel cassette
I'm a huge fan
I've got an affiliate link for where to get it in the description and again have also got affiliate links for the other types of seed storage mechanisms on the more detailed review on my website
thanks for watching
my name is
ready to be unboxed
so this is the box that it comes in nice and plain and simple and it's always time to speak to me quite a bit because they're very nice little picture overdue in the front very pretty has little constellations around it which I do quite like so
okay so here
QE on okay
Oh what
I thought it was a CD but no it's just um this is how you download their drivers so instead of having a CD we just have a bunch of web links
I was collecting
I have a little
so it's about almost
we have the little
so it's pretty much just right embedded onto the actual screen itself this you can see little dots on the corners here and I've seen that's gonna be the drawing area when I attach it to the computer so the teller itself is very slim and it's quite light as well
it's nice black material
yep and overall the material feels very nice very solid doesn't Bend any hands or anything and I guess we'll have to draw with it for us to see how it does how it feels with the actual pen on it
Dallas is quite nice and slim has a kind of synthetic plasticky top and then quite a nice smooth rubbery grip and then you have the two little buttons on the side where you can click and of course the pen nib which is quite reasonable size
I would say if I were to try this and see how it works and here we have the pen holder which is basically like a little cone there little instructions at the back here and looks like you can use this hole on the bottom to help you remove the pen nibs which
I guess I know we'll see where that goes but let's just try it with the pen on to the side put that in and it's quite a nice hold
that's that's quite impressive
how many they give you and it's kind of sad because I'm pretty much never have had to change pendants at all but nevertheless extra nerves always a bonus and I guess I'll read through this now
I've plugged it into my MacBook Pro using the USB cable and now I'm going to go to their website and find and download the driver which hopefully shouldn't be too difficult all right here it is
it's pretty standard here
we have all the buttons with the Express keys which you can customize and set up how you do this is completely up to you of course since I'm drawing on a laptop which has a keyboard
I'll probably just use that for the time being but if I was sending this to use as my default keys I'll probably set at least one of these two controls it obviously undo another two alt which I will press down in order to activate the color picker when I'm using my programs and then probably space which allows you to drag around your canvas with your mouse and then maybe some of the others too like zoom zoom out which I chase on these default options already have them set to those so you have like controls up at the bottom and then the zoom in and zoom out just above it
I would assume which is nice so you can then once you adjust it you can then use the soil testing here and they're still palette just to test the different pressure sensitivities
okay so I have Betty bang open here and I was just testing out some different kinds of brush strokes so one of the first things I noticed about the tablet was that the pressure wasn't really immediately calibrated with the brushes
I just spent a good 10 to 15 minutes troubleshooting and eventually I figured out I probably should have you know removed some of the previously installed drivers from my other tablets
the new tablet
I restarted everything and then when I went back into the program the brushes and the pressure sensitivity was working fine off with that anyway so once that was all sorted
no particular reason
I'll keep it at a pretty slow space so you can see how the brushstrokes lay on and I also explain my general thoughts on how I'm feeling about using this tablet so like I said once I got the precious sensitivity or worked out
I did think the size of a tablet being so much smaller than this screen would have made it really really difficult to use but I'll say it wasn't too bad and when I mean different size from the screen I mean like really different
computer the reason I had to do this was because my screen recording program was eating out all the processing capacity on my laptop which meant I actually couldn't record in medibang without the brushes being super laggy so I had to move to my more powerful computer anyway
I digress
I might not be getting the best experience because I am using this with like a maximum discrepancy between a screen and the tablet size but the thing is I use my Wacom Intuos art with this with the big screen all the time and the reason
I don't have this exact problem is because I can use the tablet in mouse mode and I have a lot more control over how fast the brush actually moves on the screen and just by having those two options I can get a lot more control and precision out of using my tablet
so here we are
speed and screen calibration will actually be a real game-changer but as I guessed I got used to pen mode pretty quickly so and not not being too much of a problem
I definitely didn't have to push very hard to get the full range of pressure and I'll say I didn't find the options to change the pressure-sensitive really really affected how it felt at all
I know I tend to press down really hard so every time I come across a tablet where I barely had to put on any pressure it can take a bit of getting used to but I think that's a real take-home message that I want to emphasize here
I was about an hour in the whole drawing experience felt pretty natural and I was able to start putting in the details and work through the remainder of the piece pretty quickly
the group was just super soft and it was just a nice size and weight which made it really pleasant to use also given a size this would be a great on the go
if you're looking for something to take with you on the go there you can just quickly plug into your laptop at school or at a cafe to finish up some work you know how cafes have those really tiny tables
dedicated work work overall
hi this is
Brad Linder with Laputa
and this is a Dell Venue 11 Pro which is a tablet with a 10-point 8 inch full HD 1080p display this particular model has an Intel Atom Bay Trail processor 2 gigs of ram and 64 gigs of storage
Haswell CPU up to 8 gigs of RAM and up to 256 gigs of storage also has a couple features that you don't often find in little tablets like this including a full size
there's also an micro
that really helps set this apart and earns it a pro name for use in enterprise is the fact that without there's a little bit tricky to do sometimes but without any screw driver or anything you can go ahead and remove the back cover and pop out the battery
it's it's pretty good
I've tested with an Atom processor and it doesn't I don't have any problems running full screen applications like the the weather app here pull up something else a Kindle app and you'll see to here that we can do side by side applications just fine
Netflix works
great let's go ahead and grab game real quick here so despite the pro in the name this is definitely a device that you can use for casual things tablet friendly apps now
the biggest problem of course is that the Windows Store doesn't really have quite as many to have a friendly apps as some other platforms but the apps that do exist like minion rush
that we're playing here
something else that of course you can do on a Windows tablet but you can't do on an Android tablet even though there might not be as many tablet friendly apps as there are for the iPad or Android tablets
so here we've got
it's not particularly cheap
well pretty much a full size keyboard a nice touchpad here but there's no extra ports so you don't get any extra functionality in terms of adding more displays or other peripherals but it does have a built in battery and like
it's surprisingly close
scrolling works okay
HD video there's a 720p video but full screen video and a sluggish internet connection like I said you can run multiple browser tabs and no problems now one thing that is a little bit of a problem I find is the screen resolution is sort of a mixed blessing in desktop mode so whereas a Full HD screen works great for Windows Store apps like minion rush that we looked at before the weather app
now you'll see that
we can highlight we can crop and so forth and it looks pretty good until you sort of and it's a little hard to get it this across in the video but look at the size of my thumb and look at the size of these menu items
you can use the touchpad here but these icons are really pretty tiny because again just isn't really optimized for a device like this that has over 200 pixels per inch on the screen so likewise if you're running you know say a web browser in full-screen mode here and we're looking at different apps
it looks pretty good
now you can go into the Windows settings go to screen resolution go to make text and other items larger or smaller and we can go ahead and make text smaller
let's even go all the way to the smallest setting and you can fit even more on the screen and so what that lets you do is say open multiple windows
but everything was really tiny so compare my fingers to the size of the text on the screen there so unless you sort of stick your nose right up against the screen you might not really take advantage of all the extra pixels that you have here but if you went back to magnifying the text and everything else it's sort of like using a lower resolution display now
I would say in in tablet mode than it does in desktop or notebook style mode here when you're using something with a high-resolution display like this so I'm never gonna really complain that there's too many pixels on the screen but you want to sort of know what you're paying for because this device is $4.99 and up and if you wanted to get it with a keyboard like this it would actually be closer to 560 at a time when you can buy something like the Asus Transformer book t100 for 399 or less
if what you're looking for is something that you're gonna use a lot as a desktop in terms of power performance though it's hard to find anything else that offers as many options as the Dell Venue 11 Pro this is Brad Linder with lilliputian and a quick review
and now for something a little bit different this is a Dell Latitude but not just any Dell Latitude this is the Dell Latitude 72 20 rugged extreme tablets so take a look at this you might think that only companies like Panasonic Toughbook our symbol
this is not a thin and light tablet for consumers but for some of you this is gonna be fun educational different and for those who do work in various vertical markets oil and gas industry the military
any number of things
it's 11.6 inch tablets
that's pretty darn nice
Intel claims display
look at this thing
self-defense yourself
you put it together
and besides that there's an even more expensive model it starts about 3500 that's the 72 20x model and now one is even more rugged it's supposed to have armored casing on it and it's explosion-proof so if you're an explosive environment you can use it safely which is a rating we've seen on these even some ThinkPads because folks do sometimes work in the oil and gas industry where that's an issue this runs Windows 10 on Intel eighth generation youth series processors with V Pro
the cpu chipset
the display is full
that's perfectly fine
we've measured 887
anti glare all this sort of stuff in terms of color gamut and the whole rest is pretty much your full srgb color spectrum coverage on there contrast is pretty good
Dell included their so-called rugged pen which doesn't look much different from the usual pen and this is an intrigue active digitizer so for those who even need to fill out forms on the road
yes 4G LTE is available as a Snapdragon X 20 modem for those in who need connectivity anywhere that you are the keyboard by the way has very bright white backlighting and the key travel is very good
II kind of keyboard
it's not Microsoft precision but I don't think this is the reason why I think it's the ruggedized kind of waterproofing nature of it is that Denis indeed you really have to press hard with your finger if you use a usual kind of light touch that you might use on a track that it's often fails to register consistently you have to press hard kind of annoying the ports on this are on the side and they are covered to prevent water intrusion
that's your choice
45 watt
Dell doesn't charge more for that if you're in hurry to get a charge quickly you have USB C on here and you have USB 8 3.1 you've got a micro SD card slot and an rs-232 port yes
I know a lot of you will laugh at that but again think of this the industry this is meant for where they actually plug into the devices that they have to maintain and they communicate over rs-232 serial cameras are a little bit more important
when you're using this in the field in a vertical market situation you have an 8 megapixel rear camera which isn't bad and a 5 megapixel front facing camera as well and there's a little privacy slider switch for that as well so have a battery life which is a little bit less of a concern when you can swap new batteries in and out it has two 34 watt power modules
and you've got almost 70 watt hours of power here so that certainly makes sense and just because there's a rugged tablet doesn't mean you can't accessorize beyond the keyboard so on the back
there's actually a screw on stand right here if you want to have a stand to prop the thing up there's a rugged dock that's available there's a handle so you can carry it by handle that attaches to the top so there are a variety of things that you can actually add on to this and yes because it is meant for businesses to purchase and again industries where things have to be serviced in the field
I'll be showing you
this is the tablet
we're good spacing apart
is this lock toggle
there are two shot
so that's the knit
if you apply a lot of pressure the tablet also comes with gears very handy pen then we can put the sellers like this or you can put it vertically like this now inside the stand
there are eight with casement tips here and this is a wireless USB receiver so you have to put this into your computer's USB port in order for the tablet to work wirelessly and knit remover is actually built into the stand
Nick very easily
after you switch on the tablet there will be a small indicator light here and when you move the stylus over the working area the like will become a bit brighter
so we can choose from a list of keys that are on the keyboard and add some common keys to get your shortcut you can also assign a mount button to the
Cisco shortcut buttons
that's the pressure curve
I will be using my screen capture software instead of filming with my camera and the reason is because my camera is unable to fill my monitor without creating all those distracting your a pattern now before I actually use this tablet they actually when our battery so I have to charge it and gets the first down side of the cue 11k
so that's the problem
there's no way for you to continue the project until you charge tablet so make sure you switched off the power of the tablet after you have done using it if not the battery is going to drain out all right
I think it works
go inside look for the diameter and set it to change with pressure and set the variation all the way up so this is what I can get now the transition between thin and thick in Illustrator
so pressure works here
that is free
you can see here
let me show you the transition between the thin and the thick so the transition is quite smooth trying for cube when it comes to creating line art with the tablet
I have three sketches
The Strokes actually
now what is that the glove stroke it is supposed to end with a thicker stroke so even if I apply very little pressure it's still going to give me a very thick stroke right and so I have to pick this brush in order to get that in stroke right and it does work with pressure but again the brush settings will override the pressure so right now I'm pressing down very hot and now it's very thin but I wanted to keep her gaze but I cannot because of the brush settings so I need to use this brush instead but other than that this software try also a sketch is pro
to use some mouse to mouse over your icon to click it or you can use the keyboard shortcut 11 right - okay but editage right at the login page you cannot use that the texture of the working surface is actually very similar to welcome into
I'll show you that
they work quite well today but maybe they start behaving a bit strange the Yahoo just quit the app and just restart it and that will solve the problem so I'm not a big issue
the lines were jaggedy and they keep breaking up so I was wondering why then I switched to putting the USB receiver here in state to use the USB port here and the problem went away so I think there was some Wireless interference with my computer
I think this tablet is good for those people who have more tables AIDS so for me if I were to get a tablet I will get something a bit smaller anyway
greetings everyone Eric
yeah the a 30
it is just kind of a standard one that you put on your desk and draw with and if compute it's powered and runs through USB but yeah we're gonna take a look at this little beauty which yes
I'm very much used to using my screen tablets so take some of the artistic license with a grain of salt because I'm just not as used to these things as I am with be screen tablet
it's very affordable it's I think it's just a little over $50 so a very affordable and I would definitely check it out and they'll obviously be links in the description to where you can go and get it so let's jump over to the footage and let's tell you about some of the features
it's very sleek
it's very clean
it looks professional
you can see a little bit of information about like the model numbers and stuff like that and a little bit of the specifications which I'll also go through anyway as we look over to the front the front actually gives you a little bit information
250 PPS report rate no idea what that means 5080 LPI resolution which is actually really nice and of course 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity holy crap that is so nice and now we'll flip her on open
let's get her open
so that's really nice but we'll set her over on the side and look at the insides first right here we have the USB cable which is nice has a little ninety degree on it which is really welcomed
it's very very indeed
but it's really nice
I really enjoyed it
I like the little sleeve that they give you and then we get to the inside of this thing where I'm going to have to figure out how to heck to get this open to get the stuff on you have to open up the sides to get some of the stuff on the inside not the greatest design in the world but you can see here
we have the spare nibs and the little thing to help you get the nib out which is always very welcome and of course the QuickStart guide which has all the little information you need to get started all right time to actually take a look at the Sabbat
I'll talk about later
alright so now
that is my bad
I did not expect that to happen but anyway I will put a link on the screen just so you can know that you just got to go to the bike comm slash download you
Windows or Mac for the drivers you need and then down here you have a little bit of instruction so little manuals and stuff so you can also download which is really really handy so I really like that
they allow that
so first you need to make sure you actually plug in the device and it'll install the basic hardware drivers on your computer once it's been connected once that's been done
you can open this up and start running the actual installer which will not take too long choose your desired pass and then basically just hit install and this will install relatively quickly now we have the actual driver in basically the configuration so you have the
which is really nice
I had to switch it over so that it would choose my main monitor and it also allows you to squeeze but choose between right and left-handed as well as a few other things as you can see here on the screen you can mess around with those as you like as you can see here you can actually see my hand moving across the screen you can see the surface area so I just want to make sure you could see that which is nice then you have the actual function keys
they're not that visible
the buttons are interesting
I'm not really sure
give up resistance to it so if you kind of wanted to have a little more of like a paper like consistency this actually does have a little bit of a paper feel because it's got like at almost a texture
II to it
this is one of those conditions where it's like user error or user error but now it feels nice in my hands like actually using it but I think if you're if this was your starter like if you're this is what you're used to then
okay let's see how this thing handles being used with a straight edge of some kind so if I were to try and go from here over here not too bad needs to be like a small bit of wiggle but it is seemingly consistent so I'm gonna guess that that's actually my ruler
being a little inconsistent
I really like it
it's really good
nice and sturdy
the one in the middle is fine but they need to actually put some decals on it like something you can physically see better because only in like the right light
yeah really good tablet if you can get used to those things those little like button things that's fine like it'll do exactly what you need but I would say either mark this somehow either
but you definitely would need something to see this a little better and I hope if people look like are watching this please make those more noticeable because it's hard to notice them you can't see them very well and they only light up when you touch them if they were lit the whole time
I could see it
I can go oh
I think it's fine
and kind of jumbled
together especially with like different microphones different camera or not different icons but different like camera angles and stuff and then obviously this is a live section here but yeah thank you so much for watching
I also do streaming
I'm using a stream
they're all clickable links are down in the description so please go down there and check them out and thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video later
how's it going
everybody sketch monkey here
Hui on contacted me and asked me if they could send me a tablet to use in my videos and to show you guys what it can do and of course I said yeah send it to me
I'll make a video about it and check it out if it can replace my beloved old Intuos 3 from 2008 which I can actually take up throw into the wall and then still plug it in and it will work fine so will this replace that tablet or not
I want to first of all say this that when it comes to gadgets and when it comes to phones and all this technology a new product every single year from all these companies
that's all that
I couldn't use it anymore because it was too slow so I had to buy a new phone and that's don't want a reason why I got the iPhone 7 otherwise it would still have the iPhone 5c
I'm gonna show the tablet talk about the tablet that I'm gonna show you what I'm going to be using it for and if I think it's a great tablet the pros and the cons and all that good stuff
that's been with me since 2007 and this one is pretty special to me because it's been around the world pretty much from Sweden when I bought it in 2007 to me this was a huge investment back in the day because God was this college student
you can see that
it's kinda kind of worn there so I'm actually I was actually looking for a new tablet and I did not know if I wanted a tablet like this or an actual display where I sketch on top of the display so when hoo-wee on offered to send me one of their new tablets the huion canvas 20
I said yes
send it to me
I think you need to like replace this part every now and then but this is the same standard one that I've been using since day one and it still works great
I haven't changed anything on this but the point here is you can start with something small and then a paper for example start with that and then you jump into tablets and Photoshop or coral painter or even paint
like right here
how my installation went and of course you also have the pen and the holder for the pen which looks like a tiny little donut and inside of this donut
they're all in there and in this second layer of this package you have the screen itself and I wouldn't be worried about the shipping of this because it's packaged really well
now if you're running this on an iMac you're going to need an HDMI to Thunderbolt or mini DisplayPort adapter to make this work since Apple wants to be special
you have this allen key and the screws as well and this takes about two to three minutes and you have the release for the foot on top so if you just reach behind where your hand and pull up the handle in the back
you're comfortable with now
I did not have to do any sort of calibration or pressure settings or anything like that what I did do though is change the warm tone or the cold tone on the tablet
it's a warm tip
the standard set up was too cold of a tone for me so I just went into this menu and played around with it until I got the tone that I was looking for
the most important thing for me is to have a smooth gradient between black to white and if you have too high of a contrast you're going to see these cut lines between the black and white and it's not really a smooth gradient so you kind of have to play around with this until you find the settings that work for you and it took about two or three minutes to set this up let me show you the pen of the huion
and it's not as bulky as this one of course both of these buttons back and forth are customizable on both pens but I only use one of those buttons and it's always been the front one and that would be a right-hand click mouse click and what that does in
that's covering the screen
we go enjoy once
everything was plugged in
it was very simple to either mirror the screen so that you have the same screen on the iMac and the tablet itself or even better you can have two different screens and you know what that means
so you just put it like that or you can have it like this with the creases right here but if this nib right here if it gets worn out this little thing right here you have a ton of them inside of this thing so you just twist it open like that and boom you have all the nibs you need for at least a few years moving forward inside of this thing
second reason is
I've been using display tablets and jumping back and forth between regular and display tablets for over 10 years now so I'm used to using both and can switch anytime and still be comfortable sketching however large display
especially if you have
I haven't noticed any lag time when sketching either the response time is the same as what I'm used to meaning I don't notice any delay and it doesn't cause any problems when sketching fast one thing to notice is that the compass 20 does not come with any customizable buttons on the side of the screen but to me
I never used them
so what's the verdict
yes yes we can
the sketch monkey tablet
I will still be using my old Intuos for when I want to sketch on the laptop out in the living room or take it to a friend's house for a sketch session
welcome to the family
i want to give a review and a quick outline of some of the features performance and the battery life of linux us 17.1 android 10 on my galaxy tab s2 before we start
so some things that i say may or may not apply in the future anyway starting off with the features it now has dark theme do not disturb mode which previously wasn't available in android 7.
so you can natively install and run apps from your sd card and then of course there's digital well-being and you can set up focus mode bedtime mode and parental controls in terms of performance
i don't play much games on the tablet but from what i've tested so far games generally run smoothly but there was one time where the game crashed during a loading screen
but that hasn't happened in a while now as for the battery life the first rom that i downloaded it drained 60 of the battery overnight so i installed the november 2nd update and the battery
life has been stable ever since i still get around 5-8 hours of web browsing reading pdf and watching youtube videos for most days before i have to recharge but if you wanted to play games i think it will last you
they're not super annoying
it's been more stable
i can only view one app at a time which is kind of annoying if you want to say for example open chrome and note taking apps side by side
also if you remember about the google assistant i was installing nhos where i was given the option to receive notification about weather news quote or a joke every day
all in all though lineage os provide much smoother and faster android experience than the stock room in my opinion but it is not a complete package it is missing some features and some things can be improved for a smoother experience
but i just want to say thank you to the developers who made it possible for us to be able to use this custom rom and experience the features that being said though
stay safe and peace
I made this list based in my personal opinion and I try to list them based on their price quality durability and more to find out more information about these budget tablets you can check out the description below
5 it's the Fire HD 10 after I spend some time trying to find the most affordable talaq in the market the Fire HD 10 popped up on my screen
who's a tablet lover
if you like watching things on a bigger picture the Fire HD 10 is one of the best it may not be a top-end tablet but this tablet doesn't disappoint the specifications and features on the Fire HD 10 are surprisingly great with a screen size of 10.1 inches and 2 gigahertz octa-core processor
it'll give you the performance you were looking for it has a storage of 32 gigabytes but you can change that using a micro SD card and add another 64 gigabyte
it has the fire
it is the design simple design but while I was using it it started slipping a little bit you might consider getting a case for the Fire HD 10 but otherwise everything else is perfect the performance and features are amazing as I was opening up tabs and examining the tablet I came to the conclusion that the Fire HD 10 is as good as the high priced tablet that have more to offer
I used it
I said to myself that this one is worth every penny to anyone who wants a cheap but good enough tablet I recommend the fire HD 10 at number 4
gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM 89-53 processor and 16 gigabytes of storage the Qualcomm Adreno 506 graphics card allows you to experience great pu BG experience however when I opened a couple of tabs it started to lag it is a bit of a disadvantage that it still runs the old Android 7.1 operating system
I tested it from a hundred to zero and surprisingly it took the tab for 13 hours and four minutes to shut down when I first put my hands on it
it felt very comfortable and smooth and the overall performance of this tablet was good enough at first it was doing a great job but as I was opening more and more tabs and meanwhile checking my pub key stats
it draws my attention
it surely is a tablet that you should consider if you already decided to buy one it really feels comfortable to Hulk you won't have problems of the Aces n pad s8 when it comes to holding it
it has a qxga
I'd recommend this tablet to anyone who likes to work with tablets and who wants to have fun at the same time as always working on a design with my tablet I realize that the Zen pad s8 is one of the most valuable tablets in the market
it may disappoint the
adapter is pretty awesome too and it has only 32 gigabytes of storage space which is not that good compared to cheaper tablets but it can't take microSD cards the first thing
I noticed on the media pad m5 is that it feels a bit weird when you use it vertically but you get used to it even though it doesn't have a headphone jack you can rely on a USB type-c port for audio output
you might experience great things with this tablet and I personally tried gaming and had a lot of fun it doesn't lag when I switch between apps or open up 10 Google Chrome tabs and after using it for some time I really started to like this tablet like I said
and everyone else
a 10.1 the Tab
A 10.1 is definitely one of the best tablets in the market great performance and beautiful design it also has a lot of features that tablet users love to see
make this tablet a perfect one for everyday use it has a 10.1 inch 1920 by 1200 LCD screen but the fact that it has thirty two gigabytes of storage makes you wonder add a micro SD card it has an X in r7 I know for CPU and two gigabytes RAM
no lags at all

the Lenovo tab seven essential as a new Android tablet with a starting price of just 79 US dollars for that we get a 7 inch display almost vanilla Android 7.0 nougat and optional
Amazon fire
let's start this review as you might expect at around $80 the build quality of the Lenovo Tab 7 essential is not the best it features the full plastic body however the design did improve compared to the previous version while the predecessor really felt cheap
while it's nice that we get a front facing speaker it is just one so don't expect to get any kind of stereo feeling and the speaker is pretty small and so how do quality is kind of bad
you will see pixels and every smartphone has a much higher pixel density however the pixel density is similar to 10-inch tablets with an HD screen and that is alright if the price is right and that certainly is the case here it is an IPS panel with good viewing angles and colors look good
gigabyte internal storage
comparisons the performance is not good at all however in the benchmarks it actually is a bit better than the predecessor as I said the Wi-Fi version has a difference if you but the performance should be very similar I bought the 16 gigabyte version of said that
simpler games like banana
Kong run fine and I even was able to install it and play as well extreme at lowest graphics settings however you will see occasional eggs it also noticed several times that EPS like one drives that one in the background crash while playing this game
my news feeds and feedly without any problems and listen to podcasts with other apps and while YouTube and Netflix are usable tools that is not the case with Chrome
performance hits fast in fact even when switching between two apps you might have to wait a couple of seconds and yes even if you just want to go back to the home screen so the performance really is bad if you own a relatively modern smartphone
it is very likely that you will be disappointed by the performance of setups of my century as I said simple apps to run and are usable however in my experience that cheaper Amazon fire
we don't get too many pre-installed apps either out of the box they are the Google Apps Outlook and Skype for Microsoft as well as a couple of standard apps like a file manager and a radio app with the ID version we get a phone and text messaging app too as I said it pretty much is vanilla Android and it supports all of the standard features from nougat that includes the split screen view again
I'm always looping in HD video at 50% brightness and activated Wi-Fi okay the tip 7 essential might not last 20 hours but the 10 hours from my battery tests are actually very good for such a cheap device
it's fine for very simple tasks but that's it and even when surfing the web or switching between two apps you might have to wait a couple of seconds the benchmarks are not even that bad but Farida
use the tablet is just too slow the Lenovo Tab 7 central might be good for you and a certain conditions only for example if you really cannot or don't want to spend more money and prefer almost pure Android
it does feel a noticeably cheaper and the display is not as nice but in my experience the performance is much better during everyday use not great but better another alternative is the Amazon fire HD 8 depending on where you're from it might cost a bit more however the performance is much better and the screen has a higher resolution if you don't like Amazon's interface you can take a look at the very similar
thanks for watching
why is it important
but this is a metal recovery seat backup and most people don't realize how important that is so tell a quick story at the end about why it's actually important in real life but what this does is with every hardware wallet that you have and even some software wall as it comes with either a 12 18 under 24 word recovery seat back up there
typically you'll write down on a piece of paper with just a pen and then you store that away so if you ever lose the device or lose your hardware wallet you can actually recover it to any other wallet
that's compatible
well that's where the
Kobo tablet comes in
and it's a backup to your backup so if the fire happens if a flood happens if anything happens where that piece of paper gets destroyed and indiscernible this will withstand the test of time so
so let's take a quick look here so Kobo if you're unfamiliar has a very premium and high-end Hardware wallet as well that is military-grade and and built really for just serious hot oilers and I'll leave a link down below in the description for you to take a look at that video as well but this year is strictly for recovery seat backup so as you can see
it's a very nice box a very nice presentation and what this is is basically a metal and it's very sturdy very durable like even the box itself is just very sturdy and just very durable
what this here is is a place for you to put your recovery seat phrase and on here on the front here to have just the first basically you just need the first four letters of each recovery phrase to restore it and then on the back
well actually
it's a treasure
but you have a very nice high-quality titanium plate comes with screws for removing it and obviously sliding in the tiles which we're gonna take a look at in a second and what I really like about this year is that there's a hole already punched in here
it's very very simple
basically you just unscrew like we had back here we just come to unscrew this and then you'll slide in the tiles and there's a slot for it right there and have some extra scores here
where if you like want to tape it shut for a long period of time you can comes with obviously a little screwdriver so that you can unscrew it and get it set up and I'll do another full in-depth video of actually using this and setting it up so stay tuned for that one on the next but here are your tiles with all the different letters
and there's more than enough for you to have at least two recovery seeds if you have the twelve word phrase recovery or if you just have like say a treasure one or a ledger nano s
it has all the right number of letters and the right number of everything that you need here so basically in this you know in the next video when I actually install it and set it up here you basically remove the plastic from these things you punch out these tiles one thing I will add also is when I did a previous review
for the crypto steel
where was it
oh it's right here
but basically you'll unscrew this and then you can slide it out break off these tiles and then slide it in and there's a slot for each of them right here but very very cool very very sleek honestly the quality of this product for being 39 dollars
it should be
this is really really important to have and I'll tell you just a quick story if you want to zoom out for a second so I actually have a good friend of mine that had over for Bitcoin
that was enough protection and when he was moving one day his girlfriend put in all the soaps and shampoos from the shower just happened to get thrown in the same box
you know hectic moving can be and one of the shampoo bottles spilled and it got all over his recovery see phrase and lifted the ink and he completely was screwed at that point
that's exactly why
I'm gonna also have another video coming to do a full demonstration of how to set it up in a tutorial but I'm also gonna have a full-blown written review on my website
Bitcoin lockup which I will link down below so make sure to check that out if you have any questions or concerns before I do the next video where I'm actually going to do a full tutorial on how to set this up leave a comment down below
honestly didn't know that they had such a nice quality product and it's cheap you know their Hardware wallet is almost 500 dollars so the fact that they have a an affordable recovery C pneumonic backup was very very refreshing so if your budget conscious and you want to protect your crypto link down below to get this set up and that's it will go ahead and follow up on the next video
thanks for watching guys
look at that
tabpro s in terms of how portable it is easy to carry around you know about the size of a 12 inch macbook to make a few more comparisons inside we have intel core and the six generation cpus
in this case there is no room for a silo here and so therefore they can only give you an external pen so that's a good thing and this is welcome
it's a bit more affordable but it's also still very good 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity palm rejection all that good stuff and there is a quadruple a pen that lives in the barrel here not unlike synaptics pens and intrigue pens that we've seen on products like surface pro 4 that uses entrant for those of you who are wondering how you are going to carry your pen and not lose it
and it's it's robust
pounds is pretty light and even with the keyboard it's about 3 ounces less than surface pro 4 so it's around 2.4 pounds 2.3 5 pounds or so compact easy to carry it has magnesium inner frame
it feels pretty sturdy
bezel flexed a lot so I stopped because lenovo is real good to us with their review and as they say you can do anything you want to if it's the only one you get and I didn't want to disfigure this or break it before we did our video review so stay tuned for the written review where I get instructions on how to actually open this up without destroying it
that is not the end of the world up because you can use it like so and that's maybe a little steeper than I would like for drawing but it's it's not bad either
you can go down this far and still have resistant support and that's the point where it just collapses so you get the idea of the range that you have right there and it goes all the way to almost upright which is probably more upright than most people would want so in the box you get this well iconic
it's even got backlighting
there's not much echo
the only thing that does make a bit of noise is a track pad but lenovo doesn't tend out the quietest track pads and you even get the nab point pointer over here and the discreet hardware buttons up top for that which is pretty cool and this is fairly rigid too
a little bit weird
Pogo pin connector
so you slide that this comes off and you have a piece of plastic that you don't do much with because it's just there to cover up the stuff on the bottom and you can see here
I believe there's also going to be a projector module those of you who follow the Novo's Android tablets know they love to include projectors in the rotating hinge barrel that will plug on here
and lastly there's the Intel 3d realsense camera module for those of you who need to use the depth sensing camera that's probably more for vertical market work than anything else so those will just clip on right here and it's it's much cleaner way of doing things in the helix certainly and it's interesting way of expanding the possibilities and on this side we have mobile
what amounts to pretty much all the port's we have a USB C 3.1 Gen 1 port there so that not all not only handles charging the tablet it can do USB storage with adapters and it can do display out as well
so you're probably don't want to find something that does both charging and monitor at the same time because it most the time you're going to dock it on your desk
the nice modern
Kensington lock slot
the power button
it would turn on
it's just too easy to activate honestly when you have the thing in transit but well next time hopefully they'll use a stiffer button or one that doesn't stick out quite so much on the back we not only have the glowing little eye for the ThinkPad logo right there
II and designed
nits a brightness
so it competes well with surface pro 4 there and it has good color gamut 75% of Adobe RGB and full srgb so it's pretty much up there with surface pro 4 and a lot of other consumer laptops and certainly a lot better than the helix that we first reviewed with Windows 8 that had about 50% of Adobe RGB black levels are decent at point 4 7 at max brightness of the resulting contrast ratio which is the comparison between black levels and full brightness is 760 to 1 my first reaction
it's been a challenge for us because it's reflecting every in the room and the lights and all that sort of thing so yes you can adjust your cloth with your comb while looking at your reflection in the display happily
it is quite bright so you can compensate for that glare but outdoor use can be a bit annoying because it's like a mirror the ThinkPad x1 tablet is available with intel six generation
skylake core em
that's a good part
skylake really has impressed this so far with the performance levels that said if you're real heavy-duty user if you're going to be using this to use Corel Painter 2016 which is a heavy heavy program
we're just fine
yep if the filters are going to take a bit longer and Lightroom I'm never a fan of Lightroom on the core M even a dual core CPU sometimes is not the best and I wish for a quad core
there is the core
change there's also a core m7 - 6 Y 7 v 1.2 gigahertz available in either case you'll get Intel HD 515 graphics and you can see our score here on PC mark 8 home accelerated 26 23
CPU like you might find in the ThinkPad x1 carbon or yoga and those would be scoring in the low six thousands to mid 6000 for the multi-core score there so this is behind but it's not behind by a terrible amount either now w prime which attests how quickly it can compute
pi scored twenty five point nine seconds versus about sixteen point five seconds for a core i5 skylake laptop with a dual-core ulv cpu and so that's a test that really shows the pure cpu performance there and obviously it takes a bit longer
it's been fast
I haven't found this to be a laggy machine except when trying to use Lightroom and Corel Painter and I'll demo demo so you can see Corel Painter in action some other drawing programs so have a battery life
x1 tablet well
M really is more about being cool and quiet being no fan more than it is about battery life improvements so about 6 hours doing light productivity and streaming video if you're pushing it hard doing lots of Photoshop filters compiling code and you'll get shorter runtimes of course but given how bright that displays I've been running it on 35% brightness level
which would be about 120 nits in our tests and Wi-Fi on an active and we're doing about 6 hours sometimes five and a half but more like 6 most often now there's a Productivity module again with a 5 hours worth of additional battery
Lenovo's is essentially upside-down
now the nice part
is that the metal will dig into your legs if you're using it wearing shorts or something like that but otherwise real clothes and a lot of measures if you folks would like to see a snack down between these two shout out in the comments and we can make it happen how about inking with the included
Pro works just fine
it's lovely lovely for note-taking and the fact that it's relatively compact and light makes it even more pleasant now how about a program like ArtRage ArtRage uses you modern windows
Inc api's if you like and it's pretty lightweight program so it's good match for the Intel Core M here where we occasionally saw a little bit of lag and stuff now
control is fine there
I'm drawing on this court but I could rest my hand on the screen here and make a total mess of the painting right now by drawing black lines on our lovely Sun set you see
it's keeping up
it goes heavier now
let's say like that
I'll show you Corel Painter 2016 just because it is very heavyweight professional program it has a lot of features but it also is a place where I often saw the pen lagging here so here we have Corel Painter 2016
and that's actually doing pretty smoothing unless switch to something you'd probably draw more quickly with like pencil or crayon and I'm going to go with the vine charcoal and it's starting to fall behind a bit from where I am so if I'm trying to draw quickly sometimes it loses it other times
it's decent
I make a Mis drawing but it's bearable so that's the Lenovo ThinkPad x1 tablet available soon like I said pricing looks to be around probably 1,100 to 1600 depending
how you configure it
it competes with surface pro for obviously in the price range and also for a lot of features including things like a built-in kickstand detachable magnetic keyboard pen in the box for a change
Lenovo full-size pen
I mean not one of those little too picky things it's a good tablet when I first saw it I really have was crushing on it and after living with it you know occasionally for art working
I just kind of wonder if lenovo kind of thought of something a little extra special sauce wise here besides those modules to get more excited at this price point
what's up YouTube
there's a link there so go check it out so just kick off the review and talk about how the blackberry playbook feels to hold and the aesthetic sort of features of it
7 inch screen
it doesn't look too
it doesn't feel flimsy
I wouldn't suggest throwing it around to test that out but it does feel nice and all in all just it really gives off a really pleasing image and something you really like to show off if we just talk about what ports their own the externals of it
it actually does take really good quality images and you can get some good shots with it an important to note both the front facing and the rear facing camera gives you 1080p full
you've got the power button and the control buttons right there on the on the front of the actual playbook just on to the side of the bill and the LCD screen
what's out there
so as you're looking at the front of it you're the speakers coming out the back which is really useless blackberry or rim have really thought about where to put the speaker and it really works
well it's good quality speaker as well so you're good treble and bass in there and you don't need the headphones like you may need for other other tablets out there and then on the bottom
HD video so you can record HD video on this tablet hook it up to your TV and then you can now stream it and it's also got a USB to port right under there as well so that's the aesthetics of it and the features on the outside in terms of the screen is a 7-inch screen you get a 1024 x 600 resolution
I thought that I might be a little bit small as I'm holding it but I was actually surprised that it just felt natural when it felt like a good size
in terms of the screen size some reviewers have expressed that they prefer the larger iPad size 9.7 inch and I definitely do enjoy the 9.7 inch screen and it may have been good if if rim incorporate a slightly larger LCD screen but that's not the market they'll going for and I wanted that slightly smaller tablet this if you've got big pockets will fit into them and the LCD screen looks very very flesh so you know in respect that's a big tick of approval on that side in respect to the software
other tablets
that's been sort of expanded to suit a 7-inch tablet and if it really tell it doesn't look native and it doesn't look that well with this one the iOS or the OS is very good
it's very streamlined
so you can touch them and activate menus and so forth so it does work very well and blackberry did put a lot of thought into that so it's not only the LCD Porsche in respect to where you can see the pixels
that's touch sensitive
also the black bevel edges are tape sensitive so you can swipe from the bottom you know from the top yet all sorts of options when you do that so it works really well
it is probably a second or two slower than other tablet browsers out there but you do get a lot of functionality with the browser and like the OS rim has really thought about how to structure and how to create the browser and add to the users experience
lot of browsers or a lot of tablets out there don't support flash so things like youtube and other sites are supported and when you go to watch the video you just can't watch them you get that big error message and a big black box so big thumbs up to rim for the flash support you can also turn flash support on and off via the city so there are definitely other tablet makers and os makers out there ie Apple that could definitely incorporate that into their into their systems and those tablet makers
because that's emails would be something you'd use a tablet like this for quite extensively especially given the blackberry name and history and respect to business use and so forth
if you have 15 blackberry bridge there are and what they will do is transfer contacts and emails across to your PlayBook but there are two negatives in respective like very bridge although it works well it does chew a lot of power up because it connects to your playable 5 Bluetooth and secondly once you disconnect the connection from blackberry bridge you lose that functionality so it isn't a permanent option and solution there is discussions out there or there are talks that there will be a native application released
this sort of beholder
there is in the OS in respect to the email in context and so forth so the BlackBerry PlayBook comes in three versions a 16 32 and a 64 gigabyte version all with Wi-Fi connectivity none of the versions have 3G connectivity which is a real shame because it would be good to have one of the versions with a 3g version but there may be a 4g version coming out in the states in a few months but nothing in australia
life wasn't too bad at seven to eight hours especially considering in too much much smaller form factor than the ipad 2 and all in all is a really great user experience that I and the LCD screen did take me by surprise
it's really crisp
it's nice and smooth in operation and the colors are very vibrant and the fact that you can use flash is a big thumbs up on the negative i would have liked an email client to be included with the software and well there
I would harp on is the fact that it doesn't come with a 3g version not sure if I would push the 3g version it will depend on the additional cost but there are people in the market out there that would need or prefer a 3g version so I do think that blackberry may have lost or we may have lost our some sales in respect to not having a 3g but all in all it's a fantastic product if you're in the market for a tablet
you do get less applications with a blackberry playbook compared to other tablets especially the ipad but if the applications are there that need then definitely check it out from a hardware side on the software side obvious
it's very very good
so it's a blackberry
twitter at tech stops
hey 90 bucks
I figured one out
let's do it so
I'm down with it
4.1 jelly bean
okay sure 16 gigs
memory internal absolutely micro
I'm with it
I'm winning perfect
it's got preloaded apps
I don't see anything that would lock it down so I think I can uninstall everything that's on there so I figure what's doing so these are the specs when I read these specs to you guys and probably throw them up
I think they call that 2k and yeah sure lever arm cortex a8 1.2 gigahertz but we is dual-core so that's all the better micro 8 micro SDHC expansion slot it does take the HC which neither will go up to 32 yes 32 maybe 64
I'll not really know able to love VG adding standard Bluetooth 2.1 m a camera or 1.3 front-facing and with this one we do have a 2 we do have a 2 megapixel rear facing so just a hair better than the front built-in rechargeable lithium polymer battery and up to 8 hours
continuous asterisk asterisk asterisk
let's actually unbox this
not too embarrassing
I get it and of course our micro USB cable for data transfer so overall a really nice box in job for let's call it a mediocre tablet and I'll get to that now for those of you who stuck through the word mediocre
not so great
we have micro
SD card slot
I mean you got she's back here USB host that's gonna be the one that you can pull in from and Oh TG charge ha so it has the capacity to charge through the USB
headphone jack
purposes got two standard phillips screws on the bottom here and i imagine once you pull those bad boys off it comes apart pretty well now it does come with a screen protector on here
it does have these little tabs but I feel that if you were to cut those bad boys off this would actually function for a good long time as a decent screen screen protector
so for point one you got it for point one lock screen and I went ahead and put a live wallpaper on it just to see how it handles it again
I don't expect much
Big B if I have with this it actually will have to switch launchers to get this to work so had to switch launchers and get this about to get this back on so it comes with this nonsense launcher it's set it's called V launcher in the system don't probably visual land presumably it's got these kind of categorized strings
I guess not quite that terrible but it uses up one of your blender lines here uses up some screen real estate just to show you what screen on which you see
what's on the screen
your video player and all that stuff and and it's got a header on the top of it not a big fan not a big fan at all so what
which means that
I definitely switched it
there's a letter following
I would say absolutely
if it's 90 bucks or even up to let's say 120 120 for our 10-inch with decent enough display that was our Google mount with a decent enough display if you're looking for reading for browsing it actually does browse browse fairly quickly
so it's in pretty good shape as far as the basic browsing needs even video watching and I went ahead and hooked it up via the mini HDMI because I'm always curious to see how these things work and it definitely worked really well in comparison to the eMac
it actually retains its capabilities on the primary screen while you're using the external display so it actually gets a bit of a better nod for me especially if it for media but again I go back to my handy-dandy trust the compartmentalization and say get something else
there's some sort of I mean comfort is the only word that comes to mind and I even went so far as to try to install it by removing the get jar which you can
I was correct
Play services installed Google
I know I can go and get my own apks and all that noise but it's supposed to be easy at least for me and I don't have to be able to
that's just me
I'm kind of lazy about that stuff like if I want a nice one that I'll get it to mess with it see what I can do with it but if I just want it to work I just want it to work well yeah so overall I would say you know for fun for media maybe you put some low-end picture taking with your 2 megapixel rear camera
yeah pick it up
what's going on everybody
usually you gravitate towards a hybrid because you want to use your laptop as a tablet or have the capabilities of writing or drawing on it now in this video
you might also be considering the traditional laptop form the first thing you notice is the design it has that same metal aluminum chasis as the x1 carbon and that rubber texture to it which feels really nice in the hands
L 810g certification so it's passed some strenuous tests like humidity fungus water tests even dust so this thing can take a bigger beating than your traditional consumer laptop in terms of weight
this is very important
it uses a battery
but the connector itself doesn't do a good job of holding the pen so if you flip the laptop upside down the pen is most likely gonna fall out now when it comes to ports you're not gonna get much with this laptop on the right-hand side you have two USB Thunderbolt 3 ports so if you're the type of person who's going in and out of office meetings connecting your device to a projector you might be better off with the x1 carbon because you pretty much have every port for the business environment
the x1 tablets going to cause you to carry around a lot of dongle if you have a mouse that's qsp a or a hard drive that's USB a you're gonna need a dongle for it in terms of upgradability
you're not gonna get much out of this laptop as well so make sure you spec it exactly how you want it because down the road getting into it is gonna be a little bit difficult with the x1 carbon
SSD the display on
if you're using
I wouldn't bring this to my kids graduation and snap photos of them but in a pinch if you need to take a photo of a document to scan later or something important you don't have to pull out your smartphone unfortunately
it is absolutely awful
it doesn't look good
you probably want the best quality as possible since you're talking to someone face to face and the last thing I want to talk about is the fingerprint scanner it does have
because you have less material to work with now obviously the x1 carbon feels more comfortable to type on you're only getting about 1.3 millimeters of travel distance on the x1 tablet
when it comes to the touchpad itself you get a bigger touchpad on the x1 tablet so more space to move but I do find the x1 carbon to have a slightly more sensitive touchpad
both laptops are using
let's say you're transcoding some media that's when you'll see the speed difference when it comes to day-to-day tasks like browsing the web having tons of tabs open working in Google
Docs maybe you're doing
I 5 in here
it doesn't get any hotter than about 70 to 80 degrees Celsius when it's under full load the back of the laptop the surface temps hit about 50 degrees Celsius which is right at the top anything above that
the x1 carbon
I can use USB type-c so that's very convenient but just note that you will be charging this more often than the traditional x1 carbon so here are my closing thoughts
top and as a gorgeous display a very durable design the hint is solid it has great performance and of course great security features the only areas that it falls short is battery life and poor sound
I think the only reason to buy the x1 tablet over the x1 carbon is if you want something that you can draw sketch on and sometime use it as a tablet for every other scenario
Amazon HD 10 tablet
actually and was something that I was quite pleased with before and now it is better and it's not all that expensive either so we're going to be taking a closer look at this in just a second but I do want to let you know in the interest of full disclosure that I paid for this with my own funds
nobody is paying for this review nor is anyone reviewed or approved what you're about to see before it was uploaded so let's get to it now and see what this new tablet is all about
and then there's an option to buy one without ads for about two hundred and five dollars so if you don't want the ads you can pay a little bit more if you don't mind that lockscreen showing up every once in a while
the screen is glass
it's nice and bright
so it's a little bit narrow when you've got it in portrait mode like this so some websites may not look as nice on here given that versus what you might see with an iPad which has a more squared display now
it's got a mediatek
Mt that is an octa-core it's got 4 a 73 cores and for a 53 cores and as you'll see in a few minutes the performance on this one is quite improved over the last one and I was happy with the performance on the old ones and this is a nice step up in processor performance
it only has though 2 gigabytes of RAM which for a tablet like this is not a big deal but you might notice some slowness when you're doing a lot of multitasking and that sort of thing now
I'll get pretty decent stereo separation here but if I move it into a portrait mode sound is only going to come out of one side of the device and that's one of the little sacrifices you make when you buy a budget device like this one it does though have a headphone jack here at the top it also supports Bluetooth audio so you do have some other options for sound
if you don't like the internal speakers there isn't much else for ports on it you do have that headphone jack as we mentioned you have a USB type-c port here but this is just a regular USB port in operation so it's not charging any faster than prior tablets did it's still a 5 volt 2 amp maximum going in it doesn't support video output
USB devices in directly if you've got a USB C memory stick for example or with an adapter for hard drives and other devices so it functionally is the same as before but it is nice to start seeing USB C popping up in more places
you got a volume rocker over here and your standby power switch on that side and again you'll get some ads on this one when you power it back up now thing on this side here and then over here is an SD card slot
it'll secure itself inside the slot and then you can secure it further with this little door here to keep it in place and this is very useful because Amazon Prime video and Netflix
allow you to download things to the SD card to watch offline and that can be very helpful if you get a long flight or something like that coming up
it supports wireless
you should be fine
Netflix and Amazon
there are ways that you can hack the device and put Google Play on it but it's not easy for general consumers to go through all of that so you can look up some methods of doing the google play shoehorn on this which will certainly add more value and apps to the mix but generally most of the apps you'll find on google play at least the popular ones are also available here on the Amazon side of things now as an Amazon device this will function essentially as an Amazon echo
I don't set off your devices at home and I can do something like this tell me the weather in New York City today so as you see there it booted itself up or at least woke itself up from sleep
it was able to address my voice command and then give me a visual response like I would see with an echo show device for example and it's got a nice big screen that's larger than the echo show so this can kind of double as an echo and as a tablet depending on what your needs are at that moment you can also do all the home control stuff as well so I can say
show me the backyard camera and this of course will integrate with my blink security system that we reviewed a few weeks ago and it will now pull up the camera in the backyard and depending on how fast your security system is
I'm just going to stay here in the basement I think and just continue on with my day but you can see how this can be really useful if you are using a lot of those echo devices and with a nice big 10-inch screen you can get yourself an echo show
first than a tablet second you have that option so what you can do here is pull down this menu from the top of the screen and is going to be an option here for show mode and when you turn that on it will turn this device effectively into an Amazon echo
it plugged in all the time when you're running it like this because I believe the display stays on all the time just like the echo show does and then you can issue your voice commands to it and never have to touch the tablet at all
now if you decide that you want to go back and use it as a tablet you can then just switch that mode off and it will bring you back into your tablet interface
depending on what priority you want to give to the device if you want it to be mostly a tablet and occasionally an echo you can just issue a voice command to it and do minimal voice commands or flip it and have it be an occasional tablet and a primary echo show device
the choice is yours and it's nice to see them integrating some of their other products into this one and I think it makes it a very useful tablet as a result now as I mentioned the little earlier performance on the new tablet is better than the old one and I was happy with the performance before this one is running nicer
from a performance standpoint
it's running pretty nice
it's not completely full speed so I'm detecting some lag here and there and the audio is jumping around a little bit but it's largely playable and I wasn't expecting it to run this nicely on a device at around this price point so they definitely made some nice strides here with the CPU
not perfect here at the PSP but I think if you're doing other 80s and 90s consoles it should run pretty nicely this will also do very well with in-home game streaming so if you're doing that with your gaming PC that should work pretty nicely so there's a lot of useful things from a gaming standpoint that you can do with this and I was most impressed with its benchmark scores so we ran the 3dmark sling shot benchmark
so that was great
a score of sixteen hundred and eight here verses six seventy on the original you could also see where the seven-inch tablet is the one that just came out that one is much lower at 239
but as a comparison point you can see the iPad seventh-generation which is the entry-level iPad that one scores much higher so from a gaming perspective the iPad is probably going to be better in the long run and developers will probably be targeting that higher-end hardware but the iPad
you'll have to maybe buy again or shoehorn that Google Play Store on but overall very nice performance here for a one hundred and fifty dollar tablet now Amazon is touting improved battery life on this tablet
they're saying you'll get about twelve hours of usage out of it and I would agree with that assessment provided you have the display brightness turned down a bit and you're not doing anything all that taxing if we were running that PSP emulator
Prime video watching or whatever that stuff shouldn't impact things too significantly and I think you'll probably get north of ten hours of straight usage again with minimal activity and the screen brightness down but overall a very good battery performer here and something that's in line with more expensive tablets like the iPad so overall this is a pretty good deal
the display looks fantastic

yo what's up guys
I'm just saying I haven't ever owned one of my own drawing tablets so this is gonna be a review based on my opinions of my first ever drawing tablet so I'm gonna go through a few things just one other thing
so it's up to you guys if you're in the middle of a thing and you just stab it in there it's absolutely fine and the other thing if you guys want to ask any questions that
I have to have it set up quite loud so I can pick up my voice and also my camera didn't focus at points so if you see it get a bit blurry
yeah it looks good
I'm guessing this is the bit that you hold that the pin sits on like that so if you are like drawing something and it's just like they're good just like holds it down
crucial spear nibs
that's very quick math
cool it's ended better
free pain tablet
we might need that
that's fine okay so
so that's quite nice
I'm pretty sure though
they called them sore
I'm pretty sure this is to hold your pen but I don't even use that anyway so that's all good and with the pin when you're drawing along it along it
I don't think you would have any problems with the packaging because the packaging was very nice and padded and it even came in a screen a little bag which covered the tablet so I think that should be fine for you guys
I think it's done
I'll just move it down to the bottom right corner so you guys can see it all so it comes up with this and you can do do the priest keys so the priest keys are basically the keys down the side of the tablet if you guys can see those two four six eighteen twelve twelve of them down the side and you can set those to any hotkeys you want
there's two side buttons
I'm pretty sure it's live right now if you press anything anyway so you can sit those two each button you want you can change the pressure sensitivity and all that you can also sort of create taste all
this feels so weird
Claire's cool okay
that works fine
this is really lightly
that is a hundred percent enough for what you're doing unless you have a hotkey for like every key on the keyboard 30 hotkeys all together should be fine okay so I got oh my gosh that feels so insane awesome so now if we press this button undo so we're just undoing it all look at that that's awesome
let's do it way
you'll see that
look to it
I like the design
most of the tablets from the graphics are brights clear and well defined there are two modes the Nabi functions in so there is more than one interface the first mode is Nabi mode
when on the tablet the other is mommy daddy mode which is what parents will use to set controls and security features as well as make purchases the interface for
daddy mode is password-protected
it is responsive quick
keep it secure for kids to enjoy but doesn't lessen their experience overall it's a great tablet to learn more about the nabhi - and to see other kids tablet reviews visit us at best toys guide calm
what's up guys averagetechguy
let's check it out so i can't give you guys a really good review unless i have already opened this device up and tried it out and i've done that i've put my information in here
i've turned it on
now when you open this up the first thing that you're going to notice is that it comes in basically like a little cloth type packaging you get that off you get
the box will be the actual usb type-c charger you're gonna get the standard samsung brick with this and you're gonna just get your basic instruction manual and you can just put all that to the side for right now but we want to focus on this
that sits up top power button and volume rockers on the side and this is where your sd card slot is now like i mentioned three separate colors it comes in black gold and silver two variations
you can either get the 32 gigabyte model of this or you can get the 128 the 32 gigabyte is going to run you 229 bucks while the 128 runs you 329 so it's basically just kind of pick your poison because you can always get the 32 gig and put memory cards in there and upgrade your storage
right up here
i don't take pictures with the tablet so i'm not really that interested just giving you guys the actual specs on that camera so 5 megapixel up front you got an 8 megapixel shooter back here on the back you got 2 gigs of ram bluetooth
it's fast it's fun
looks really good
really clear really crisp
it's it's not lagging
i don't play those games so i'm not sure i'm sure there are tons of reviews out there where people can tell you if those games will work on here but this is basically as much gaming as i'm gonna do on my tablet so we did the test
and it's gonna be one of those tablets where you're not gonna be doing a lot of heavy duty things on it but this is just for that person the average person who just wants a tablet and needs to do a little bit of productivity wants to watch a little bit of entertainment and maybe even wants to just surf the web
so since we've seen gaming i want to show you guys how videos actually look on here so i'm just going to use one of mine for example we um get that
i'm going to brighten that screen up just so you can kind of get a little bit of better effect on that there you go so it's decent nice sound on here
um now so the reason i'm saying this is one of the most durable that you can get is because you actually have this hard bottom where your keyboard is going to be housed and then you actually get another rubberized
this is going to be a great tablet for that person to buy so as i said galaxy tab a samsung galaxy tab a 32 gig model right here you can expand that storage
another svelte boomerang
poking it at the breathtaking 0.25 inches six point five millimeters the Xperia z2 tablet is the slimmest tablet out there almost as stick as it's a microUSB port it is also the lightest of them 10 inch slates including the venerable iPad air or Samsung step pro 10.1 couple
just make sure
sorry state however is much wider than its main competitors on account of the unwieldy side bezel which is so large that makes the 10 inch display look smaller than it is mic much like a picture frame on the positive side as it makes the tablet very comfortable to hold with plenty of space to rest your thumbs on without touching the display
also since the tablet is so thin and light you can easily just hold it with one hand as there's this wide area for the opposing thumb to grip the sides firmly into place
the firm grip is also aided by the soft touch plastic material that Sony used for the back the rear however smudge is very easily if your fingers are even a bit oily wet or sweaty
it is positioned very well when you hold the tablet in portrait mode though the key goes right under the first phalanx of your thumbs so it's within an easy reach yet
it accidentally the metallic volume rocker underneath it feels sturdier but it's too thin and harder to find impress without looking plus it's tactile feedback is rather shallow at the top left side of the frame you can find the microUSB port and the memory card slot which are covered with protective flops
all waterproof bets are off so nice tablet floats for stereo speakers on the sides in two-by-two format which is situated in a way that prevents you from covering them with a palm when you hold the tablet in landscape mode sorry is using a new LED display technology for a 10.1 inches 1920 by 1200 pixels IPS screen on the Xperia z2 tablet it's called life color
for instance
that is indeed
kitkat it's an okay overlay but doesn't offer extra multitasking functions like Samsung's a multi window or LG's dual window modes which are very useful in a tablet in order to achieve differentiation
and that's about it
it's a small app suite so there were when you hit the active tasks key at the right of the home button icon by default there five apps in the bar including a remote control widget for the IR blaster at the top and a browser
you're doing underneath
it's the slower
AV variation of the a Qin one-family but still a vast improvement over the measly Snapdragon s4 pro that last year's tablets is shipped with in Snapdragon 801 G Adreno GPU is clocked much higher compared to Snapdragon 800 chipsets which boost the graphic prowess of the chipset by a third while preserving the power efficiency
this processor is just a step below quorums upcoming Snapdragon 805 saw as exemplified in the high benchmark scores the tablets relevance in the silicon department is ensured the Xperia z2 tablet also comes with three gigabytes of RAM and 16 or 32 gigabytes of internal memory expandable via microSD slot
and the ona
TV mode which serves as amp for video pulling out information about the movie currently on TV based on the sound recorded from it the experimental phase has one of the nicest music players from all manufacturer
overlays out there
it is walkman branded and offers a very appealing and easy to use interface with plenty of categorization options and sound modes to choose from the z2 tablet comes with a surround sound set up called s4 switch uses not two but four side speakers in total
we can attest that the same device has one of the best speakers we've heard on a tablet emitting very strong and clean sound waterproof speakers usually sound muffled but here the tunes come out loud and clear so watching HD music clips or video is a pleasure the Xperia z2 tablet also offers new digital noise canceling technology that is said to weed out up to 98% of the ambient noises while listening to music
Sony's own noise-canceling headset and the pair is not included with the tablet in every region the default video player runs every popular format you throw at it including DivX xvid II and mkv files out of the box and up to 1080p in resolution attack
and as we mentioned you can stock in a bathtub with a waterproof tablet too while streaming your favorite TV series which is awesome the eight megapixel Exmor R sensor in the back of the tablet is managed by all the bells and whistles
you'd expect from
so if you want to use the full resolution of the camera you have to change it to 4 by 3 manually from the app settings the superior auto mode has received quite a boost from the 45 percent increase in image processing power that comes with
Snapdragon 801 compared to 800 it focuses and snaps very quickly and gets the correct scene settings most of the time including a fast reversal to macro mode resulting in nice bulkier
back background blur effect
when shooting close objects
the tablet also performed well keeping noise in check and shrink clean and well exposed photos and IOD flash should be of help in low-light scenarios though such things are usable even without it
it's not waterproof - and doesn't have an IR blaster the top or a memory card spot for that matter in the end unless you're aiming for that high pixel density the z2 tablet here comes
you can buy the moment even if you're firmly invested in the iOS tablet for Tech's Sony's slate mic while with the extra features it offers before the iPad air 2 this was Daniel for phone arena presenting here the Sony Xperia z2 tablet for more information about this and other slaves you can visit us at phone arena calm
so let's jump into this review starting with the least expensive tablets and we'll work our way up to the more high-end tablets this is not a sponsored video but Wacom did send me some of these tablets unconditionally to review as I please as all these all opinions in this video or my own alright so I know we're not very far into 2020 but a lot of these tablets were released in 2018 and 2019
Wacom medium version
there's a pressure-sensitive pen with over 2000 pressure levels that you can use to draw on the tablet and the tablet surface has an active drawing area of 8.5 by 5 point 3 inches
Wacom but I don't recommend purchasing a small tablet if you're going to be using it primarily for drawing or painting a small tablet is OK for small gestures like you would use for photo editing or annotation but it's much more comfortable to draw on a larger surface with larger gestures if you can even though the 1 by Wacom is one of welcomes most affordable tablets
you have to draw on the tablet which connects via USB to your computer and then you look up at your computer monitor to see what your drawing number eight is a small step up with the Wacom Intuos 2019 medium version
the Intuos has an identical active drawing area to the one by Wacom but it offers a few additional features such as 4000 pen pressure levels for handy Express keys which can be programmed to perform shortcuts
if you're drawing with a pencil you can use tilt to angle your pencil to shade with the side of it the Intuos Pro also supports other types of pro pens like the art pen which can sense a barrel
make a huge difference
if you're a pro illustrator it just feels so much more natural to draw and paint with these features the Intuos Pro has a rougher surface compared to the smoother surface of the Intuos and one by Wacom
fortunately you can change the feel of the pen and the surface of the tablet with optional nibs and surface textures the Intuos Pro also offers eight Express keys and a touch wheel
plus it supports touch gestures which can be used to pan and rotate your page and zoom in and out the Intuos Pro can be connected with USB or bluetooth
this is the
I rank two the Wacom one a bit higher than the intuos pro because I believe most artists are going to feel more comfortable drawing directly on a screen but in many ways the Wacom one is a downgrade from the intuos pro with only 4000 pen pressure levels and a pen that more closely resembles the basic pen that comes with the non-pro Intuos and oddly enough the Wacom ones pen only has one shortcut button while the entry-level one by Wacom Span has two buttons
it is actually useful to have two buttons on your pen so that might be reason enough to go with the Intuos Pro but at least the Wacom one's pen supports pen tilt which makes it stand out from the other pens included with the N two O's and one by Wacom the Wacom
one has an active drawing area of 11.6 by 6.5 inches which is considerably larger than the Intuos Pro medium but only a bit narrower than the Intuos Pro large and not as tall because of this taller aspect ratio the large Intuos Pro lends itself better to large gesture
drawing another notable difference
in addition to the USB cable needed to transmit data in contrast the intuos pro can be connected wirelessly using only bluetooth much like the intuos pro the Wacom one supports additional pens but only specific EMR pens and unfortunately not any of Wacom pro pens one feature that sets the Wacom one apart from the other tablets in this list is its ability to seamlessly connect to select android devices which allows you to draw and paint on your phone instead of a desktop or laptop now
I know I said the Intuos can connect to Android as well but it doesn't do it nearly as well as the Wacom one does while the Intuos only maps a portion of your tablet to the devices screen the Wacom one can open your phone full screen in desktop mode
mobile apps are soon going to adapt to accommodate display tablets and despite those drawbacks drawing with the Wacom one is light-years away from drawing with a stylus or a finger so it might be worth it to choose the Wacom one over the intuos pro depending on your needs
I think if you lean toward pro then you probably want the intuos pro since it offers a better pen a larger gesture space and multi-touch if you're more of a beginner or a hobbyist and the pro level features don't matter to you choose the Wacom one and if portability is a concern the Wacom one does have an advantage by being more low profile than the Cintiq switch are much bulkier number
I think you should choose the 22 if you can afford it if you're trying to choose between the Cintiq 16 or the Wacom one then if you lean pro with the Cintiq 16 because it comes with a more comfortable pro pen - which has twice as many pressure levels - pen buttons and an eraser the Cintiq 16 also supports welcomes other pro pens and it has an optional adjustable stand which I definitely recommend if you want to work at a more comfortable vertical angle as with the Wacom one the Cintiq
why number four choice is a duo of display tablets known as the Wacom Cintiq Pro 13 and 16 as with the pro and non Pro models of the Intuos we have a full featured model and it's stripped-down counterpart the Cintiq pro
Cintiq 16 both devices have a screen resolution of 1920 by 1080 and both support the Wacom Pro pen - along with other types of pro pens but the Cintiq pro 13 supports multi-touch and it has better color accuracy at 87 percent of Adobe RGB compared to the Cintiq 16 and 22 which only support about 70 percent of Adobe RGB the pro models of the Cintiq also offer three USB C ports on the side which can be used to connect the display to other devices
there's also a headphone jack and a security lock slot and the pros antiques offer more video connections such as USB C mini DisplayPort or HDMI gone are the Express keys on the exterior of the device
Express key remote
you can purchase which gives you a touch wheel and 17 programmable keys but you can also pop up on screen keys with any of the tablets on this list so you might not need express keys first
if you're working on your tablet for long periods of time the stand is more sturdy on the Cintiq 16 and 22 and attaches a more securely but that also makes the device less portable and more bulky the Cintiq pro feels more like a tablet computer while the regular Cintiq is built more like a TV the Cintiq pro 16 is slightly better equipped than the Cintiq pro 13 with even more accurate color at 94% of Adobe RGB it also supports an Ultra HD screen resolution
which means you can see more detail when you're drawing if you do a lot of fine line work and you want to be able to see maximum detail when you're zooming out on your canvas then
having a high resolution screen is nice however 1920 by 1080 is adequate for digital illustration and anything above that is more of a luxury than a necessity so basically unless you care about color accuracy and the other
that is squished
down into a tablet computer unlike the other display tablets in my list the mobile studio pro is the only model that does not require a connection to a separate device like a laptop desktop or Android device the mobile studio pro 13 and 16 run Windows 10 and that means they can run any application that is supported by Windows not light versions of desktop apps not mobile apps
the mobile studio pro 13 has a wqhd screen resolution which is better than the 1920 by 1080 supported by the Wacom one Cintiq 16 and 22 and Cintiq pro 13 but not as crisp as the UHD resolution supported by the Cintiq pro 16
UHD resolution but it offers less accurate color at 85% of Adobe RGB compared to the Cintiq Pro 16 which provides 94% of Adobe RGB a mobile studio Pro 13 offers even less color accuracy with only 82% Adobe RGB coverage just like the pros antiques the Mobile Studio Pro is equipped with USB seaports and can also be connected as a regular Cintiq to a Windows or Mac computer though in the case of the mobile Studio Pro second-generation the USBC ports are Thunderbolt 3 compatible similar in design to the Intuos Pro the mobile studio pro has either 6 or 8 Express keys and a touch wheel one feature that sets the mobile studio pro apart from other tablets
is that it can sense screen rotation you can use this to draw in portrait mode or change the angle of dripping paint on your canvas while the convenience and portability of the mobile studio pro is nice its hardware will eventually become outdated you can upgrade the RAM and SSD on the mobile studio pro but that won't delay its obsolescence for very long another downside
what's coming up next in second place is the Wacom Cintiq pro 24 and the mighty Cintiq pro 32 given its ability to harness the power of your desktop the Cintiq pros offer the best tablet experience
give you plenty of room for your application interface while keeping your canvas large enough so that you can make very large gestures while drawing or painting if you are a pro illustrator than this is what you want
24 is 99% Adobe RGB which is very accurate color the Cintiq pro 32 offers 98% of Adobe RGB coverage but 1% is not a significant difference in either case these are the largest and most accurate display tablets that Wacom has to offer the Cintiq pro 24 and 32 have the added bonus of an included express key remote which magnetically attaches to the bezel
there's the official
technically these are portable in the sense that there is an optional computer module that you can add to the Cintiq pro 24 and 32 called the Cintiq pro engine which will allow you to turn your Cintiq pro into a fully functional computer but it's not as portable as the self powered mobile studio pro would be because you'd have to lug around a large Cintiq plus find outlets to power the devices
if you just want a big screen to draw on you might be more comfortable with a Cintiq 22 since it includes the stand and does basically the same thing as the Cintiq pro the Cintiq pro 24 and 32 are the pinnacle of digital art tools
or are they well
fan noise may not be much of an issue for you but I record audio and video of my drawings so I don't need any unnecessary noise ruining my magnificent voiceovers the Cintiq pro 24 and 32 have external fans that come on intermittently and aren't super loud but are loud enough to bother me if that's just how it had to be that I would accept the fan noise but because I've used other devices that aren't as noisy
Wacom did put out a firmware patch that allows you to lower the fans but it's not recommended and according to welcome it can create a temperature increase on the surface of the tablet now
I don't know whether this morning is meant to prevent sweaty palms or if it's to stop users from unnecessarily decreasing the lifespan of their device but I do know that there's a reason why the Cintiq pros need to cool off and it's probably best not to mess with that
same goes for screen resolution as I mentioned earlier 1080 HD is an adequate screen resolution and you can make great art with just that remember the one by Wacom that came in at number nine
it's just a number
I do wish I had USB C ports on my Cintiq 27 q HD but at least it has four USB ports I can use to connect peripherals the Cintiq 27 q HD includes the Express key remote
the Cintiq 27 q HD supports 97% of Adobe RGB which is only a hair less than the Cintiq Pro 24 and 32 and best of all there are no noisy fans on the Cintiq 27 q HD like you'll find on the Cintiq 24 and 32 just like the Cintiq pro's an optional stand is not only available but I'm also insisting that you need the stand in order to work comfort
there's a similar official
I'd love to see
thanks for watching
hi guys this is
Luke from vo-tech again
there it is
TT 9 3q is an extreme budget device from China that whilst looking good on paper as a paperweight streaming device doesn't live up to any of its promises at all
that's built like it was put together by someone blindfolded and whilst being tortured there is a fair amount of flex in the design and it's entirely plastic its solid and heavy but not in a premium way by any means
the interface is sluggish
because we're up to version 7 these days on proper budget devices it has 16 gig of internal storage but this runs out super quickly because of the bloatware installed some of the bloatware is also damaging material like in a previous site suddenly appearing on their default browser and the software manages to install popups and lock screens without me
doing a thing
I've had to install
it does have a few interesting features in the setting such as a game mode for the screen that optimizes the color so that videos in gaming look better but because the performance is so bad
this doesn't really matter graphic intensive games would chug at 2 frames a second on this thing such as Nova Legacy scene here look food games and karting like kid games
run okay on it
just don't run anything
where speed is needed
four megapixel disaster and the rear camera being only two megapixels which doesn't look any different to the other one you won't even get a make out figure taking a photo over this dumb camera and has a flash zone which is good
you're the bluetooth speaker
if you have bad as the glass truly is it is by no means a reputable Chinese rabbit like chili cube or sham lead or even tech last line of products
go for those pieces
the battery is good
your experience won't be any better because the software can't catch up to what you're doing at all the only thing it does do right is look like a tablet when people come to a house
you've been the audience
we have weekly content
I've been lookin
have beer tastic fun
see you guys
was it worth it
Tech friends welcome back if you're new year my name is Craig I make straightforward and easy to understand tech videos if you're into smart home devices Apple products and other cool tech you are in the right place links to anything I talked about will be in the description
let's get started
what that means is
this is something that
I was not aware of but Amazon has been doing this for years with their Cheaper Kindle devices when it is in show mode you do not see these ads also the ads go away when the tablet is unlocked and do not return until the screen is locked again the Fire HD 8 tablet has an 8 inch 1280 by 800 resolution HD screen storage starts at 16 gigabytes of internal storage
that can be expanded
you have stereo speakers
what's happened some others
YouTube Google Apps however there are third-party alternatives for some of these which I am so far not impressed with as for productivity apps you can find some of the cloud services such as onedrive and Dropbox
you can also download
I might need there are third-party alternatives but I don't want to use an alternative to Microsoft Office or Google Box not when my iPad already provides the real thing that brings me to the downside of this device the productivity side
on this tablet
it feels clunky
Kindle books and prime video it is a great size for a Kindle replacement for reading or as an inexpensive tablet to watch around the house or on the go
I like to stream the news in the morning as I'm getting or off putting it on the counter while I'm cooking and I don't have to worry about damaging an expensive iPad or a computer
I think this also makes a great device for kids you can have free time unlimited to limit the content to kid-friendly content only now the area that I like and really this is where it separates itself from iPads and other tablets is having hands-free use of legs when in show mode it acts like an echo show you can make requests using effects and do much of what more expensive echo shows can do
I purchase a doc for always on show mode which I'll do a separate video on that and a side-by-side comparison with the Necco show in the future but from the time I've been using it
Netflix control
my smart devices with my voice and still be able to pick it up and use it as a regular tablet the show mode on the Fire HD tablet fixes a lot of things
it is a fire device and not an echo so you will be missing a handful of features that an echo show would have liked most of the things you would want are there
I think it's worth
Bell to be notified of the next video if you'd like to help support the channel check out the Amazon links below if you use them Amazon will kick us back a little
this is a
this is very affordable
you get them for about 200 euro for the entry-level model which this is or you can get the better model with four legs of ram for 250 euro so I wanted to see how it is in terms the battery life and the screen and the you know performance as well as the build quality so we can start with the build quality first in terms of like the screen etc which obviously I usually have some compromise when it comes to the screen you know technology and I got to say with this one
it's not too far away from my dell inspiron in terms of you know the vibrancy so I mean you're going to be pleasantly surprised here with the actual screen real estate
so that's a pretty good thing it's also coming with a screen protector out of the box so I did peel that off because you know we don't do them here
I think suffering a little bit from glare you know where issues which these tablets tend to do and in terms of the actual build quality of the actual device at keys
what I guess have got to be some compromises here and there but the actual keyboard ever said there's minimal flex here as you can see the keys feel very nice type on and the actual device itself feels very solidly built
you can see
it's coming in like a silver color here so it looks much more expensive than actually actually is it's got like Kasim feet as well to stop it from moving around on the table which is nice
this is a full build so you will have access to you know all the apps with Windows 10 here so that is pretty nice and in terms of the actual performance
so you can see we can just open up per edge here and see you know how it is when you go into something which this is what you're going to be doing most of the time
let's just be honest
it's very usable
just go to BBC
this is the 2gig
RAM model but for those who just want to do the basics like email and you know web browsing and maybe even a little bit gaming you can easily get away with the performance here
so again rid of that help to free up some storage which is much needed here and also it supports the TF cards as you can see the side here so you could get massive TF card and install these programs and videos etc on that
HDMI out as well as well as the charging port as well as the mic here there's a USB on the actual keyboard section which comes with like a little adapter here which keeps it safe and there's another USB as well on the side here and a headphone jack
so you've got all your connectivity that you would expect from a laptop here which is good so let's check out so that we're gaining so as you can see we are playing the old classic here kind of straight
don't think you going to get away with anything else here on this kind of hardware you knowingly playing the latest games you are going to be playing like your old classics here which will get the job done when you're out and about so this obviously comes with the quite basic kind of hardware requirement and
laughs great stuff but you get the point you know very very decent actually or a spot gaming here in there so if we have a look at the system
it does tend to use quite a lot of processor when like doing quite basic tasks such as you know web browsing etc as well as a bit multitasking here
I think the main thing you need to keep an eye on is the memory as you can see nearly full utilization here 89% and I've only got a few tabs open in terms of web browsing and obviously word as well as TeamViewer here so I think as I said earlier if you're looking for a little bit more heavier use go for the four gig ram model but nevertheless I think a performs really
I think this is one of the main things actually why you'd buy it because I think it's so quoted going like about six to nine hours of battery time so you know you might want to use a battery saver to get even more juice out of it but personally
this little tablet
Windows 10 hybrid device here from Lenovo so I will leave a link in description if you want to check it out as I said it's quite affordable I'd say the only real negatives I would say like areas for improvement for the next one make it a little bit lighter
I don't even know why they include them because they're not so good at all it's going to include a selfie cam and a back cam at least make it half decent but other than that solid engineering here and a very solid device from
it does have more
RAM a better CPU and a higher resolution screen regular price on this is gonna be about 160 but as making this video they are on sale for one hundred and twenty four dollars like I said in my review of the m7 and the ma HD
tablets is absolutely amazing
I've seen I love the slim design aluminum back and the screens even on the HD version are absolutely amazing for what it is but I haven't been impressed with performance on any of these tablets
HD so inside of the box you're gonna get a tablet a micro USB charging cable and a 2 amp wall charger unfortunately lenovo hasn't swapped over to USB type-c on these lower end tablets so like I mentioned it's still using micro USB over on the right hand side
1080p display
HD version because it's much higher resolution and just to give you a quick comparison between the FHD which we have on the left and the HD version on the right
we have the mediatek
P 22 T
v RG e 8320
so we're up by one gig over the HD an 8 inch IPS 1080 by 1920 display and these look really good dual band AC Wi-Fi bluetooth 5.0 32 gigabytes of internal storage with support for a microSD card up to 2 terabytes
everything's been really smooth
I mean overall
all the decoding is done on the server itself that I'm streaming from this tablet is simply taking the feed and letting me watch it here but it works great so all streaming services are gonna work great on here whether it be
playback is great 1080p
60fps is no problem at all for this little tablet but this also worked very well on the NHD now you will get tending to pee here instead of 720 and that might be a big plus for some people but now it's time to get into the benchmarks
we're right on par
Xtreme we're right on par with the ma HD because it does have the same GPU and as you can see the fire 10 HD totally destroyed the GPU scores of these tablets
beat this out
GPU as the HD version it's not as bad as I've seen in some other lower end tablets but the lag is noticeable when there's a lot of particles on screen Minecraft Pocket Edition definitely seemed like it perform better than it did on the m8 HD but overall I did have to turn the chunks down on this one you and finally for native Android gaming
Call of Duty mobile
I'm using here
great controller it just did a full review on so it's pretty hard to recommend this tablet for Android gaming and it's also pretty hard to recommend it for any Asian here
Dreamcast this is Soulcalibur
Dreamcast game at full speed even with this great emulator and the same goes for PSP a lot of the lower end stuffs gonna work fine but gotta for Chains of Olympus and harder once the run just aren't gonna cut it even at 1x resolution with all of the hacks on but there is one thing that I can recommend this tablet for due to the great Wi-Fi built into this thing game streaming works phenomenally this is Project X cloud
I personally think that the form factor here is perfect for streaming games and I also love this 1080p display so in the end just like the Lenovo tab m8

ultra tablet here
it's not your average
Android tablet
its infancy here
I think this has to be one of the best Android tablets you can get especially round for the price I mean this is gonna be retailing for I think around between about to 399 350 u.s.
it's fully laminated
you can see underneath
I really do think that when you have a tablet of this weight and sizes 11 point 6 inches that it would really be nice to have kickstands on all those kind of tablets because then you can prop it up watch a movie and the keyboard dock
I've been trying to keep it clean and wiping it down and you can see that already that it starts to get a few smudges and just picks up over all bits and dust the things
and you don't have any mouse clicks or anything like that or you just double tap when you're using the trackpad there and overall here typing on it because you have that more space being an 11 inch tablet you get a lot more space there versus say the surface 3 keyboard and you don't get that same kind of feedback
so their focus
so you can quickly just switch between different applications like this and I find that quite handy and you have shortcuts as well on the keyboard that are suited to the operating systems
screen brightness as well you can tweak that up and down straight off the keyboard there so not bad at all there and the screen bonuses is quite good - settings menu
so you can you can do some proper actual the documents therein and and you've got a lot of options there with inserting different shapes and things and typing and really quite handy
there you can see that with the handy little swipe down menu here which is quite good and you also have a quick list here so you can disable turn off
well done application there so you can see exactly they give you times here of how long your battery is going to be like the last four for movie playback for browsing or I can get approximately eight hours here from the 75% I have remaining you can also click here to save power and it'll tell you their power consumption here and it's nice little menu on the side there as you can see that what's been using most of the battery life here but it's been did affect which is again
and you do get this nice metallic build there so if I just pause that and jump back in and just show you a couple of benchmarks here and the gallery that I ran
it does okay
that caused this
score here on the ultra high quality running at the screen resolution of a full screen but used to have that task mother at the bottom and you can see that 41 frames per second
we go yeah and two to five point seven so thirty-five thousand three hundred and eleven there puts it on par with more or less on par with the LG g3 there so it's not too bad
it's still fast enough for all those kind of needs and it should be for many years to come as well good for that and I will jump into a game here that I do have like downloaded just did effect and just quickly show you that how that runs see the menu does disappear here but what I will try and do here is just close a few of the applications that I'm running here
I get they
they are maximum performance
I'm just gonna jump into a game here of did effect as they'll quickly show you how it runs games here that the data that has no problem gaming so you keep moving look around
of course okay
I just ran out and kill the zombie and you know exit out of this so you can see most of the oil against all that I what the ones that I've tried anyway
I mean you do have the transformer book series running on Android and they are quite good machines as well but you do get a much better key what I think with this because it just just it's nice to type on and the build quality and kick stands there the speaker's the screen the cameras are good too
I wrote quite impressed with what the offering is here from remix this was a kits that Kickstarter campaign and they've done really quite well so I wrote the remix for me seems to be the Android tablet now to beat there if you're after something that you can be used as a productive slash almost notebook laptop laptop then this is the Android tablet ticket here and you can actually charge
there with their magnetic block on plug there which is very similar to a surface and you can also charge by the micro USB there and you do have ot G support of course to their overall very nice tablet and I'd like to thank thank remix for sending me this to review and do hands-on videos off
bye for now
hi this is
Brad Linder with little buting and this is the Eevee tablet which is not only a crowd-funded tablet but also proud developed and what that means is that Eve tech the company behind it not only went to an IndieGoGo campaign to raise money to help build the tablet but also went to potential customers and asked them what they'd like to see in terms of hardware and design and the result is a device that honestly at first glance looks a lot like a Microsoft Surface
so one is that that keyboard is bluetooth so it can work either when it's connected via both pogo pins or if you connect it as a Bluetooth keyboard you can type
there's a button that says oops not the most professional looking thing if you ask me but it's definitely something that helped set the device apart the kickstand as I mentioned is pretty sturdy
on the back
but it's also pretty small so I do sometimes find that I'll try to sort of put my finger on it and be told that I need to raise or lower my finger or something
is that it sort of sits flush with the sides of the device so it can be a little hard to sort of feel without looking at it but it's something that over the week or so that
I should probably point out while we're looking at this side is that this is how you store the pen when it's not in use it's magnetic hangs out on this side and it's pretty firm there
I would worry about it falling off so I probably wouldn't leave it there all the time but if you're just getting some work done and then occasionally I want to grab the pen and use it you can do that
it is a n-trig
Windows ink certified pen
and it does all the things that you would expect a pen to do including supporting hovering motions and pressure-sensitive input with up to a thousand twenty four levels of printers sensitivity being somebody with relatively awful handwriting
try to write or draw with this thing but it does come in handy when you want to do things like hovering to get previews or you can press a button and right
works pretty well
there's a two megapixel front camera a five megapixel rear camera some really surprisingly decent speakers that sound pretty loud pretty clear and even have a little bit of bass to them
not a lot
M three it's not as powerful as the processor that you would get with say a top-of-the-line surface pro tablet but it sort of splits the difference between performance and battery life and allows for passive cooling among other things
it works pretty well
I've used this for my work which basically involves blogging which tends to mean opening a bunch of browser tabs at once while writing in another one video playback looks pretty good and the viewing angles are pretty nice now
I do find that
this is a little heavy to hold and about two pounds for one-handed use but if you're holding with two hands it feels pretty good and I mean my preference is for a smaller tablet if you were going to use something for a say web surveying or we're reading a book but it is nice to be able to sort of detach the keyboard prop it up and maybe watch some videos so
I've used it for some like gaming as well so I will point out that I've tried a couple of different games on here including Telltale's Walking Dead Starcraft 2 Starcraft 1 and Lumino Cydia which I'll go ahead and load right now if I can get that to load in terms of performance it works pretty great with older games like the original Starcraft which to be fair is about 20 years old at this point so it's not surprising that it works
this machine has plenty of memory and storage and the storage is actually pretty speedy as well games like this which respond well to both touch or keyboard or mouse commands are pretty easy to play so overall
I think that you know it's likely that a 15 $99 version like the version that I got configured here is probably overkill for most people $7.99 though unfortunately didn't get a chance to test the entry-level model so I can't really say what you get in difference in terms of performance between the $7.99 and the $15.99 you definitely get more storage more memory and a faster processor but you get the same screen you get the same speakers you get the same pin and get the same USB C charger and you even get that Thunderbolt 3 port which you can use both of these ports rather than whether it's the regular USB 3 or the Thunderbolt 3 to charge the device but the Thunderbolt 3 port allows you to plug in an external graphic stock
but you can extend that depending on what it is that you're doing you'd probably get less with some heavy-duty gaming to the extent that you can do a heavy duty in gaming on a Y series processor and you would get more
I think if you were just doing something like watching video so I watched Netflix and saw the battery only go down about 10 percent after watching 45 minutes of video
I should also mention
I find it a little bit difficult to use on your lap if you want to use it as a laptop because it's a little kind of tricky to balance something that has this sort of three point system but it's doable and if you're tabletop it really does feel a lot like using a traditional notebook
PC but you do have that option of picking it up holding in your hands sitting on the couch and using it to play games or look things up while you're watching TV or whatever else is that you really want to do with the tablet so again I tend to use tablets primarily for doing things like reading reading ebooks or reading comic books reading periodicals and I find a twelve point three inch screen to be a little bit overkill but it is nice to have one that is is a very nice looking display
it's a nice little device that I think for $7.99 and up is definitely worth considering if you're looking for a two-in-one tablet in this category has a couple of features that you won't find on the Microsoft Surface and even though it comes from a company that is less well known than Microsoft
it's limited supply so you might have to keep an eye out for flash sales in order to get your hands on one of these the first units are gonna go to backers of the IndieGoGo crowdfunding campaign and in December
this reviews coming out in November of 2017 and I'm looking at one of the first pre-production units that the e was able to send me so again at 7 I ended up definitely worth considering $15.99
unless it's going to be your only computer if this is gonna replace your primary laptop or desktop computer then maybe it's worth considering at that price but I think you might want something was slightly better performance if you do a lot of heavy work at home if you want something
and like you can definitely do that on list of and it's really when it comes to things like audio or video editing or gaming or other sort of more resource intensive tasks that
I think that you would probably run into into difficulties but it works pretty well as a general-purpose computer and it does some things that you wouldn't be able to do on say an iPad pro because it does have the full Windows 10 operating system with support for pretty much anything that you can do on a normal PC so this is the Evie tablet this is Brad Linder from the Lula
hello everyone today
I'm back with the M 708 pen tablet from eg I have been using it on both Windows and Mac OS platforms to get a good feel of the product before I continue
Express keys in comparison
it's just that bit more comfortable to draw with the M 708 provides 8 Express keys twice as much as what comes in to a straw allowing more shortcuts available at your fingertips to allow faster
this means an on drawing hand has to cross over in order to access to of the Express keys whereas n 7 or 8 has been conveniently all to one side the tablet can be rotated by 180 degrees so the Express keys are flipped to the right hand side for those who are left-handed M 708 also comes with a handy pen and nib holder both intra straw and m7o
H have 2048 pressure levels and both can connect using one USB cable an advantage weapons into straw has either a G's and 708 is that it can connect wirelessly however the wireless kit itself has to be purchased separately at an additional cost of 40 pounds in the UK in all honesty
it is the most
we vary between 700
mah to 1100 mah
I remember my Wacom
Bamboo tablet got a lot of scratches on the nibs on the pen wore out really quickly however the Penta M 708 hasn't worn down at all after three complete artwork weight-wise the m7o a isn't heavy
it is definitely a worthy investment for an artist or beginner on a budget it performed well on both Mac and Windows however there are some differences between the two platforms so in order to cover this review accurately and firstly a talk about mark and then move on to Windows
I will leave the timestamp in the description box and also on screen if you wish to jump to where I review the M 708 on Windows starting with Mac downloading and installing
the driver was easy
I have rotten drivers installed and there were no problems installing that uu driver on top of are the tablet settings UI is found as an application in the applications menu adjusting
I linked in Mac OS setup video in the description box also the Express settings tab allows a large range of shortcut possibilities however I found myself needing to rotate a lot in theater shop but there was no option to have rotator as an Express key so I have to reach over to my keyboard for rotation
I mean by the is that when the next breast key like the undo button is pressed it immediately translates on the art program and doesn't do without any lag the M 708 in general has no live issues
I was using Photoshop for my Mac drawing test and even though it was a program I would not normally draw in I definitely enjoyed using the M 708 to draw with
you do pain
there are no additional steps when connecting and unplugging the n7o 8 in my MacBook Pro I was able to simply plug in any time I wanted to use it and it would work straight away I was also able to leave
I found that the windows driver refused to install unless I removed all existing pen tablet drivers off my Windows Device I had to uninstall my Wacom drivers and restart windows before installing
which was very strange
smooth and natural
I try this pen tablet on two different Windows devices the chewer high 12 which is the tablet window and the Dell XPS 12 which is running Windows 8.1 at the moment nothing on the qu high 12 which is a Windows tablet
I also noticed it was spasm when using the on-screen keyboard but as long as the cursor was within the art program area such as clip studio paint it behaves the way it should and didn't affect while drawing but I was curious to find out whether this was a driver problem or something related to chew
I being a tablet window after all chewing has its own pen and it may be two eyes drivers conferencing with Uzis drivers and true enough when I test now on my half broken Bell XPS 12
I also found that
Pro on the toilet roll however on the Dell XPS 12 pressure levels worked fine on Medibank Pro so even though both two I had 12 and dell XPS 12 are both Windows devices
I've tested many different programs such as Adobe suit studio sigh and medibang on the Dell XPS 12 which worked great on the - I know clip studio and Photoshop definitely work my drawing experience with Windows on both my chewy and L hard beans fun being able to set the Express keys to any shortcut I wanted no limitations meant I could fully personalized to my needs which definitely assisted in improving
workflow jitter
PE is barely any district impaired - what I experienced drawing on my Wacom mobile studio pro and of course amount of Justice can vary across different programs but I felt Windows programs seemed to perform better in terms of just so compared to Mac also take know that I have made sure support pressure above off and stabilization off for these tests the end 708 was happily able to cope with being left open while Windows is put to sleep I have new driver issues or driver
highly functional tablet
the tablet also feels very robust and probably a good choice for students who plan on carrying it around from home and school or college as a final note to beginners out
this has been a complete review of Yugi's M 708 pen tablet on both Windows and Mac and I apologize for this video being so long but I really wanted to set everything I had experienced and learned about this tablet so that anyone who might be considering buying it can make a more infinitive choice links for where I got mine from are in the description box and as always likes and shares are always left
we're unboxing a laptop
now this is a really good deal at this moment because normal price for this is around 1 100 here in malaysia and uh there's a 200 discount which is brilliant and i love it so this is a gaming laptop
here is a box
let's get this vertical and then of course it has my delivery informations at the down bottom over here and let's get the box opened up before you can't see it
that's really cool
actually you know this
oh yes excitement
oh yes excitement
of course extra dramaticness
it's quite nice
why is this bulging
we have over here
put this aside
i'll keep this side
i'll keep this actually
i'll keep everything within this box because once if something happens i could return it or at least get my money back and what we have here is a power brick
let's get this down
no i think not
i'll put these aside
get this unboxed
okay really nice packaging
let's get this
what's this i see
so here's the i o and i believe this is the io sticker that they have taken off for some reason has this had some really bad stuff happened to it and just fell off
put it inside there
it's quite good looking
i mean it doesn't look like a gaming laptop at all um but yeah it isn't too heavy and it isn't too thick but it's thick enough and heavy enough
so let's take a look at the i o first because that's something i'm really interested in uh so over here and if you can see or not we have a usb type a and uh what is that the power indicator and then a large outlet and then most ios on the back actually so now
i believe that's 2.0
maybe it's 3.9
i'm not very sure
i'll show you there
you go this speaker
well it's okay
just be really careful
the hinge
just open this up
get the hinge going
laptop uh yeah
see how it feels
i really like it
uh the keyboard
it's decently big
we have the privacy
good you see
there's like a mechanical stuff that you use to uh to show off the webcam which is kind of privacy feature which is really cool again uh the power button
get the large leads
which is i believe the cooling setting which you need like i'll be that that's function q so it changes your cooling from like quiet to balanced to extreme or whatever so that's actually pretty pretty cool
the hinge feels secure
i can't open this in with one hand um it just because over here down over here is quite heavy so i believe on top you can kind of easily close it and open it with one hand which is a really cool feature
very nice
anything happening hello
well i guess i have to connect to the uh power connector but anyways this is basically the start of the unboxing and then the unboxing then my first impressions are pretty nice
well built pc
there was once that i seriously felt the urgent need to invest in a two-in-one laptop for my work but due to the expensive price tag and the half-baked user experience of windows 8
let's find out
microsoft once tried too hard to combine both the pc and tablet experience in one single operating system while the two in one detachable form factor was originally inspired from asus not many manufacturers have moved on with the idea until microsoft starts using once again with the surface the joy 11 takes on the very same form factor just like the asus transformer t100 in fact it resembles the ladder so much that you might actually think that this is a rebranded device
the tablet
a standard sd card slot is also missing and it merely comes with two usb 2.0 ports which both are unfortunately underpowered to power a usb hard drive the keys fortunately deliver a decent typing experience
many programs or browser tabs on the device as the two gigabytes of ram can seriously affect the overall user experience the tablet's display may have a low pixel density
does its job
and you might want to just leave the tablet dock to do most of your stops thus the joy 11 gives me the desire to own a two in one detachable tablet
i still find windows
10 missing some apps that i've loved to use on android and ios and it just isn't as fast enough to perform some tasks for instance browsing the web which my ipad still delivers a better tablet browsing experience
even though windows 10 tends to load web pages similar to a pc the joy 11 at the end of the day is still best used as a conventional laptop but if you are thinking to carry one less device when traveling around this is still a very affordable and decent option to consider for inspection the joy 11 currently retails at 1299 ringgit over at lazada and i rate it at 7 out of 10. bye
Hi, I'm the YouTube deal guy, Matt Granite, I find the biggest tech deals on YouTube, I also unbox items, and I do side-by side comparisons to help you make more educated decisions when it comes to finding the best deals.
- [Alexa] I like all AIs. - We'll see if she is better, and we will also do some speed tests together, and if you want to grab your link to access what I am showcasing, just expand the video description box right under me, and of course, I'm gonna give away a free HD 10 tablet at the end of this video.
Both devices equally responsive, obviously the iPad has a Retina Display, but to be honest, to the slightly biased eye, as I do happen to love Amazon products, I will tell you, the screen is absolutely beautiful, they are both very, very responsive, when it comes to touch screen, and orientation.
As with all of your big Black Friday deals. But the audio, actually comparable between the two, this has Dolby Audio, this may have a slight advantage in terms of sound, but in terms of speed, very similar between the two devices.
Let's do that.
Cash. Cash who?
- A decent joke.
Tell me a joke.
That's not cool.
I wanna show you how quickly the Fire HD 10 loads video, and if you're a Prime member, with Prime integration, everything is, I mean, that was a split second.
That was amazing.
I mean, yes, you get responsiveness on the iPad Pro, but this is very, very unique, in terms of how fast this moves, given that this is a 150-dollar tablet, and this one would be three times the price. Now, watch what happens if I skip.
Great audio. Beautiful.
I love it.
So, there are advantages to both, obviously, if you have more money, go ahead and buy an iPad, but if you guys are watching right now, I'd love to know, do you own a tablet, and do you have any experience with the Fire tablets?
A Kindle is an e-reader. Fire tablets, and the HD tablets, are a different thing than the Kindle itself, although this does function as an e-reader, and you get all of the access to whatever books it is that you want to read.
Let's do the backside.
(tablet smacking) Awesome!
You want more?
You know what?
This wood dent here.
- [Matt] And, even in terms of home automation, this doesn't need to be in my home for be to me able to to use this as a home automator.
And, I will tell you, just in terms of the overall build, obviously, you're spending a lot more money on the iPad, so it feels a little bit nicer in the hands, in terms of the finish, but this, very rugged, and I do like the way the screen looks on this device, given how little you pay for it.
Okay, I didn't even...
You're so lucky.
If you want to make sure you don't miss out on any of my future giveaways, I've given away free Smart TVs, laptops, iPhones, Nintendo Switch, and this is just the start of many more giveaways, and of course, great unboxings, and money-saving time well spent together.
If you need help turning on your notifications, or leaving a comment, just click here, and if you missed that last big round of the deals I did, no problem, it's over here.
very very impressive now
because you can choose to use the Google Android operating system of course that Play Store which has got so so many apps available and if you do want to go into Windows then you've got the option of running things like Microsoft Office for example now if you are going to pick this up with the intention of running Windows then I would highly recommend you picking up that optional keyboard
just starting out
I'm gonna do some pen tests and I'm actually gonna do three or four different draw test so you'd be able to see this tablets full capabilities stick with me for this
in terms of screen
I worked on this perfectly fine though I will say there was a tiny bit of nib bounce here that I think you could probably use another pen for that
so it's not that bad and I didn't find problems with this but you could go in and color calibrate that to another monitor or you could just attach this there never monitor to your PC as well so you can color check that realistically it depends
don't worry
that's very cool
you don't often get a stand with your tablet so looking at the back of the tablet itself you have these rubber grips here for holding your tablet down on the front of the tablet
don't worry about that
I've got to say it's nice and rubberized no razor on this end but I like the design of the grip so yeah I'm gonna give this one a solid pass again see how it fares on the draw test but in terms of the actual physical design of the starless quite nice
it's well-made you could use it for any other tablet or even a laptop that you have as well so really happy with this you can find similar things on Amazon but the fact that this comes included really good really happy with this solid
yeah absolutely fantastic
I can't wear them
now here's a USB to micro USB with this kind of weird structure or support that goes into the tablet which I've never ever seen before on any other tablet but don't worry it doesn't interfere
now that cable plugs into this cable here and then one end of this cable plugs into your computer and the other end the red end of that cable plugs into this which you can plug into an outlet it also can plug into your computer so it can be host powered as well which is good so yes
let's jump in do a line test do some pen test and actually see what you can create with this tablet the pen test one of my favorite parts of any review so first off yes the pen nib is a bit bouncy but I will say sure it aware that the lines are coming off looking absolutely great you see the full eight thousand levels of pressure and they are working really well
I'm getting slow
I won't say how much just in case of which area you're in or whether there's a need deals on at the moment but I say that link is in the description for you but I'm doing fast lines
I don't think so
I move on to my drawing test obviously I do more of a digital painting style rather than the comic book style even though I have worked in comic books
you know kind of a follow-on show it's absolutely awesome so I'm watching it a second time over right now just to kind of pick up on the things that I missed and just because it was such a good show
I wanted to give it a second viewing and I quite often watch a lot of TV while I'm drawing you know that's the point of having a second and third monitors to have reference images up and also you end up just watching
you end up drawing what you're watching and you know especially just to keep going and sketching and that's one of the cool things so here if you're wondering why
tablets is that they actually seem to be better for line drawing than I would say they are for digital painting so what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna show you one where I do this with a line drawing and one where I do a digital painting of this character let's say or a character from the Dark Crystal so let me know what you think in the comments below just doing quick sketches of this but overall I found this
I found this to be really good this app by the way before you ask in the comments before somebody does is sketch a bowl you can download this from the Windows Store
I didn't notice any problems while actually painting on it the matte finish doesn't feel like the matte finish on say the Wacom but obviously it is a budget tablet however the pen nib is quite bouncy as I've mentioned before so that does feel a little different
you know that you know you're getting your colors perfect okay so if you if you're the kind of person that is buying this tablet then the likelihood is that you're not professionalized that you are a hobbyist or somebody just starting out on your journey so you're not doing commission pieces just yet you know you're somebody who's just drawing for their own pleasure which is absolutely great
the screen is slightly higher contrast than I think I was used to and it's certainly coming across that way in the video but obviously you know filming a screen is never gonna come out perfectly anyway but I
I was happy with
I happier with the line artwork or the color piece well asked me at the end of it you know obviously but I was relatively happy with both and I think you know as it stands
it has some hotkeys
probably the thing
I could especially for a budget if I was somebody just starting out I could whereas other tablets by other companies not having hotkeys not having a stand you know do I want to compromise
so it's personal choice
which things you want
do you understand hahaha
I haven't been overly overly nice about all the different features here but given all these drawer tests you'll be able to see exactly for yourself what you can do with this tablet arzul as a brand haven't had the time to develop that all these other brands have and I don't think they've had the R&D money as well but given how many different tablets they've done in the past
I think you'll be able to get this tablet for a good deal and I think you'll be able to create some good art on it so it's not a bad tablet for the money
I also think you
so that's why
I'm going to move away from the dark crystal stuff and move on to what I want to do here with this one which is to spend longer on a draw test rather than just a rough sketch
this one is a green forest e-type animal that came around with the idea that I had of this kind of fuzzy felt-covered creature that you used to get with he-man yeah
yeah it's really weird and I for would it be good if there was an elf type character who had that kind of fuzzy furry quality and I'm kind of moss-like and I just thought I want to draw that and that's how when I know it sounds really weird
I think this is actually a record from my channel the reason I've done so many on this is because I was really undecided as to whether I liked this tablet or not you know was it good
was it bad
I just wasn't sure I mean it's not the best built tablet in the world but it's certainly not the worst and it has a lot of features it has 8,000 levels of pressure it
it's a budget tablet
that's gonna change
Laurence man don't cut it you care then you'll be able to see that this this is you know the kind of work that I can do and I'm happy with this tablet
I think this is a great tablet for what it is and it comes with all of the amenities that means it's going to last you a good couple of years without needing to upgrade and that's the most important thing there if you're wondering what
I'm drawing right now
I'm thinking of doing some work on on something along those lines at the moment for may be coming up for next year so going back to the idea of lying out here
I've proven that it's good for digital painting as well as for line art so whether you're into comic book art manga digital painting whatever I think this tablet will suit you and especially if you're just venturing in to digital art
yeah it's pretty much
Gray's price you'll be able to get it because it's been out for a while now on the link in the description a good price as well so in conclusion the article d16 has you know some like I've said some good features and some bad features if you are getting this for a good deal then I would be perfectly happy with it if you're just dying out your digital art journey
the monitor tablets
I always recommend hands horses and something else beginning with hates that I just can't remember off the top of my head but this you know is 1920 by 1080 P scream with 8000 levels of pressure on the pen it has all the basic features that you might need
it has hot keys
have an amazing day
hello everyone
I'm going from guitar
this tablet is running
I 7:01 soft protective
double 9 mm thick
it's running Windows 8.1
you will get around
you will not be able to see the screen the fonts and the icons are also not very sharp but there is a way to improve the screen quality to some extent you will need to go to the displays setting and before
it's clearly mentioned here that some of the applications might not open in this resolution but I'm going to continue this as long as I'm not encountering any other issues this tablet is using the Intel Atom CPU Z 373 5g quad-core clocked at 1.3 gigahertz with 1 GB of built-in RAM and the screen supports 5 point
let's check out the time it's 1244 and the battery is at 92% there is built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth this tablet is using the Intel HD graphics display and here is the control panel
I will now try loading the camera application but I'm getting this error because of the screen resolution so I'm going to switch back to the 1 to H 0 by 768 recommended settings
let's load the file
I have this tally
okay so here
i'm using the sony
it's the same 64
the sound
here is mouse
this is a Sony
I don't have a USB keyboard but that should also work without any issues the screen quality on this TV is much much better than on the tablet all depends upon your TV resolution
I don't have a USB keyboard and I have also not connected any USB keyboard to this device but in case I need the keyboard I can use the on-screen keyboard and you use the mouse to get the work done
the knower benchmark
ok the next thing
the battery dropped by
it could be a serious iPad contender it's cheaper it's bigger has flash support a USB port bluetooth and a nine second boot up time but does that make it serious competition in this new dawn of tablet computing
it's horribly temperamental and sometimes won't even acknowledge your tap or multiple taps for that matter and will test your patience at the best of times in fact generally I just found the entire UI to be quite glitchy and screen transitions equally glitchy
firmware update the icon based home screen has a bit of an odd layout too by being a bit lopsided with more or less everything part on one side of the screen scrolling down to see all the icons and applications when this space available doesn't really make sense it definitely makes more sense in portrait mode when everything becomes central
now there's only one button the power button so navigating the web is a mix of jabbing at links and typing into the on-screen QWERTY which sensibly comes in two sizes one for desktop use and one for handheld typing and if virtual keyboards aren't your thing you could always hook it up to a Bluetooth keyboard so by having full internet access with multitasking and flash full-screen browsing on the dudu can be a fantastic experience especially for web apps like Google
Docs but the key words here though are can be the juju struggled to find Wi-Fi networks despite other devices in the same vicinity picking up multiple networks and with no way to search for a network manually
which is rubbish
it's just a shame
and it's easy enough to read on the display but there's no eye candy like you get on the iPad and scrolling pages feels a bit too much like hard work
MySpace or the BBC's iPlayer now sadly the dudu struggled to render HD streaming from the iPlayer and of course you can't use it on the move but when it wasn't being temperamental video looks very sharp especially HD YouTube clips in full-screen
jack is a must
Linux and it has a five hour battery life so there's a massive massive potential but for now there are just far too many niggles to make it a truly useful tablet and I'm looking at the touchscreen the UI and Internet connectivity in particular when I say that
Best Buy stores May 22nd and it will sell for $4.99 this is a Wi-Fi only tablet it does not have 3G or 4G though of course you can use your Wi-Fi mobile hotspot feature on your smart phone with this to get this on the net if you're not near a Wi-Fi hotspot take a look around the device
a little bit higher here and here it protects the screen if you happen to put it facedown and it gives it a very interesting look reminds you almost of our contour display is trying to do only this in this case
there you go
and it's a quadruple a battery smaller than even a triple-a battery and it works for taking notes and for drawing it does not work as a replacement for your finger
you can't just tap on the screen and we're going to show you that too to do things with it the touch input and the pen input are completely separate speaking of what you get in retail
that's sitting on top of it and you get the charger and a USB cable and we'll show you the charger because it's relatively big for such a small device this terminates in this kind of connecting or system
it's a proprietary connector though you can actually stick a microUSB cable into the device the port on this as an MHL connector and that means if you want to output to HDMI you need an MHL adapter that is also not included in the box but we use the one from our Samsung Infuse 4G and that does come in the box of that phone and it worked just fine and we were able to hook this up at the TV
hopefully we'll see that come because that would be pretty cold so this runs basically the the phone version of the Android operating system like the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 inch of course when the Galaxy Tab 7 inch came out and honeycomb didn't exist some certainly made sense with that one to be running
Froyo you've got 16
so we're not complaining about the lack of a dual-core especially for something that is 7-inch and it has less work to do lots of the display to drive that kind of thing as Wi-Fi you know to London BGN and as we mentioned there is no cellular connection in this Bluetooth 2.1 + edr works with bluetooth stereo headsets and it has a GPS as well as a digital compass unusual accelerometer and ambient light sensor now for compare
the blackberry is actually thinner but a little bit wider and of course both of these are running Android 2.0 or the PlayBook runs the new BlackBerry OS from Cuba
next back view
it's got that curved
look in the silver
it's also a bit reminiscent of a iPad design plasticy a clean looking back of the Galaxy Tab but of course library playbook has that soft touch rubbery black finish so I compared they the flyer on the right with the Samsung Galaxy Tab
Android tablets
we don't have the brightness cranked right now on the Galaxy Tab and you can see the difference in design philosophies just by the difference in the icons we got the HTC
we don't mess with the icons much versus the Samsung TouchWiz jazz up the icon kind of thing here and Samsung tends to make fonts and things and menus quite large
but it's almost too large for 7-inch tablet when they do that whereas HTC manages to squeeze more in and you can see how much more the HTC man just to fit on the screen there so for those of you who are HTC Sense fans and software and we can understand that we love it too
send stuff your questions
VoIP them and this is I will take a look at later which is a movie renting and cell service at HTC has and we've got a bookshelf over here and that's good that HTC has done a nice job of putting some apps on here to get you started with things like well video watching ebook reading and even newspapers so this is a little widget for the home screen and this really is COBOL books behind the scenes
I'll take a look at that in greater detail later so many Android devices press and hold and you can personalize it by adding your own widgets or app shortcut so that kind of stuff and you got your usual
so if you go really fast it becomes a very small spinning sort of like a blender thing and then you can grab and hold it maybe it looks cool
now how do
I was wondering you don't do this to scroll through the notes you hit the back button and that takes you to a list of all notes strange by thing
so here's a note
I created earlier
I took a picture I wrote and then I highlighted over it and I use the on-screen keyboard to assign you title to it and I invented and it did have audio so you can hear the microphone is not the best quality it makes you a little bit lispy and flatter than you normally sound but that it's okay now if you want her right here you see this is sort of like using something like paint
brush change your colors now besides being just entertaining this is actually useful if you want to draw a map for example if you want to do a diagram if you're actually someone who's talented in the graphic arts and wants to do a little in painting because this is a fairly responsive pressure-sensitive pen to see light touch barely making a mark heavy touch big fat mark
so that's incredibly useful for those people who really want to paint and draw likewise this is very handy for note-taking for those of you who like to take notes and you understand maybe and using
so you if you go to meeting or you go to class and you write a whole bunch of notes and handwriting it will not convert them over to text for you
this is really
Kobo and you can look at featured stuff free stuff all that kind of thing and if you want to buy it you tap the Buy button and then you sign in with your cowboy again so cool works nicely as an e-reader certainly next
TV shows and you can break it up on genre in movies and TV as well so let us take a look at the new movies doctor Doolittle to Dukes of Hazzard Lethal Weapon 3 Orange County Justin Bieber Never Say Never and some of them are available for rental as well looks like most movies range for about 9 bucks to 15 bucks and TV
shows are $2.00
well you use the built in gallery application to take a look at video playback since we don't have a watch account and we've got basically a 720p video over here
let's gonna
on here we downloaded you can see one of our reviews is up here for the Samsung Infuse 4G and we have set it to automatically download all Flash content behaves well
the same time to customize that browser an awful lot and here we've got a video embedded little straight here in fact it looks good so that's pretty good usually it takes a Tegra 2 to play flash video that nicely
for those times
imap4 you name it
email accounts this
here we are with our HTC Flyer plugged in via the Samsung Infuse and they child after to our HDTV 42 inches of 1080 TV that we're not going to output a 1080 because this one does 480 and 720 only as you can see here we have our options over here to 720 and 480 or automatic and everything that I see on the screen on the device is being married to the TV
now let's try to playing back the video there so now we're gonna check out some video playback using the gallery application again watching the same 720p trailer that we were playing earlier
good for mirroring
UI and some more sophisticated features for the tablet applications and the life though HTC has done a great job customizing this with all their Sense software and because right now honeycomb does not get heavy customizations from manufacturers a third-party user interface
kind of stuff
we can see why
it's hard to say if this guy's ever going to get uploaded upgraded to ice cream which will be the hybrid operating system that combines the best of honeycomb with the best of basically
Froyo gingerbread nonetheless is a great tablet for those who want to have a pocket ereader pocket video playback and with the pen it's awesome for note-taking a particularly digital artist with that pressure sensitivity
I tested, although in Paint Tool SAI if you move your hand quickly like I do, everything ends up with tails on it, even if the stabilizer is set to 0.
My top critiques are
On a Wacom
Personally I don’t notice
Problem solved.
You don’t need to use a glove, but it keeps the oils from your hand off of the screen, lets your hand move easier, and if you sweat, the glove helps with that too.
A combination HDMI-USB-power cable.
The power plug.
The stand.
And the manual.
Everybody else, carefully
Put the pin end of the cable into the bottom of the pen, and then plug the USB end into the computer to charge. Time to install the drivers. Go to www.gaomon.net/download. Here’s the manual for the PD1560, and here’s the Windows driver. There is a MAC version too.
For computer experts only: you can get around having to uninstall other tablets by keeping copies of wintab32 in System 32 for each tablet and swapping them in as needed.
Turn your tablet on.
For left handed artists, at this point on the side of your tablet you need to press Menu, press the + button to go to Display, press menu for Disp Rotate, press menu again, press + to select 180.
Under Stylus Pen
I didn’t see artists
Go to your desktop
Choose your tablet monitor.
Go to Work Area.
Other than that
The other screen tablet
bigger and much heavier, doesn’t have any shortcut buttons, and has terrible default colors compared to the Gaomon screen. So… you’ll have to think about whether you value better color quality, portability, shortcut buttons, and cost savings of the Gaomon PD1560, or if you want a bigger drawing area.
hello everyone mr me
okay I would have had this video out earlier but Google Drive decided to be a jerk and not really upload my unboxing clips so I'm sorry this is a bit late but I'm just going to get through this video smoothly hopefully I can get this out pretty soon
Oros however you want to say it in order straw something that that game that people play but I don't cuz I don't have any friends so before I talk about my opinions on the tablet
here's an unboxing yay
and if you've seen my videos before you know that my old tablet was a hearing on so I can already know what to expect also because I already opened this
it just opened
open this
who woulda guessed
Oh what I mean
why whoa
I've never had a pin with this end before also I'm guessing because there's no hole right here that means I don't have to charge it with my with my last human pin
I think it's to extend the pen I don't know I I didn't use the hitting use the metal ring whenever I had my old one but I did use these nibs quite often cuz I have no self-control and I draw a lot so I need more nibs if I hate doing this with one hand
okay so underneath that black plastic thing you have the cord or the tablet and it's just like a regular cord it's nice and it's all wrapped up in this little bendy thing
so this is this is also a mega plus for me and then you have the installation CD and then it's the manual which I I do read it but I already had a hoody on tablet so I think I pretty much get the gist of this but then again so this is a very very different talent than what I had before I probably
so it's pretty
what the tablet that
the tablet was a bit smaller than I expected but that doesn't really matter because it worked amazingly and I was very surprised with how well it worked because whenever I first started drawing I got those off-brand small tablets and they did not draw well at all so this is the first time where a smaller tablet did a mate it was so amazing and
I thought I was going to struggle a bit because usually getting used to different tablets takes a weeks for me to do but I pretty much got use of this tablet within I want to say 20 minutes of using it because it was nice and small
so bigger tablets with like 8000 buttons scare me but with that being said it is obvious to me that this tablet was made you know for osoo or just smaller artists that are just beginning or just artists
I now have to work with bigger tablets so kind of going back to that kind of gave me a little nostalgic feeling of drawing on the computer for the first time with the tablet so like I said before even though it's very small and minimalistic I really enjoyed it and I know that whoever gets this tablet will enjoy it as much as I did and if not more I'm not really person to complain or fie any issues so I really didn't have any issues with this tablet although whenever I got the tablet I I never really worked with a pin that had a clicker to turn the pin on and off so whenever I tried drawing with the tablet at first I couldn't get it I couldn't get the pen working and I panicked because I thought it was broken or I was just being stupid but I realized that the pin that took batteries which is something entirely new to me and it didn't have a battery in it so I had to go buy some triple-a batteries and that was a minor setback
love this tablet
I envy you
I did like I said before I only had that off-brand the tiny tablet that my getting pig chewed up the cord for this is a this is a teller view
so if you're looking for a smaller tablet for on-the-go use or if you're a newer artists starting out and you're wanting to save up for a tablet or ask for one for Christmas or your birthday
I cannot recommend this tablet enough now whenever I have a younger artist coming to my streams or in the comments what tablet to use whenever they first get started
so if you're watching this and you're looking for a tablet show this to someone who is willing to get you one because I cannot recommend this enough and if you do like this art that I drew with the tablet
that is my review
thank you here
15.6 tablet today.
Back when I was a gaming channel, I did the odd tech review, so I thought I’d trial an art-related product today, so be sure to let me know if this is the type of thing you’re interested in more of in the future.
As the name implies, it houses a 15.6inch screen, with the surrounding body bringing it to about 44cm by 28cm, with a maximum thickness of about 12.6mm, or 1.26cm if you don’t want me mixing up units even more.
It’s relatively light too, so as far as portability goes, there’s no reason you couldn’t throw this in a bag and take it back and forth to work or school with little issue. It’s pretty sturdy, so should withstand some beatings… I managed to drop it during the filming process and it was just fine, so… that’s probably a good thing.
The panel itself is a pretty standard 1920x1080 resolution – as someone who regularly works at 1440p and 4K, it felt a little stifling to drop back down to 1080p, but considering the price point, it’s probably unreasonable to expect more there.
It’s an IPS panel, so as far as viewing angles go, it’s pretty solid – you can comfortably swap between working on a desk or on your lap with no drastic changes to the colour or brightness.
If you’re interested in doing any sort of colour sensitive work, you probably own a calibration tool, in which case this issue is easily solved with a few minutes of calibration.
The tablet’s software offers a good bit of customisation, and we’ll touch on the extent of that later, but as far as colour goes, it offers full RGB control, brightness and contrast, and overall colour temperature.
If a calibration tool is out of your price range at the moment, I personally found the 5000K preset brought me to roughly where my tool set me at in the end.
The screen itself has a matte coating, which although won’t give you quite the same vibrancy as a glossy panel, does provide you with a lovely bit of paper-like resistance that makes drawing on it feel great.
If you’re hooking this thing up for the first time – which for the record connects via USB-C to HDMI and regular USB – you’ll likely need to calibrate it, which is a simple button within the aforementioned software. It’s a 5-point calibration, it doesn’t take long, and its results on the whole are pretty good.
One feature that I really liked is the ability to set programs to these buttons, which not only serves as a handy shortcut as far as opening them goes, but also works great for switching between programs on the fly.
But that’s about it
There are only two major negatives to me – the first is the colour accuracy – it’s not great out of the box, and even after calibration, it definitely leaves a lot to be desired as far as fidelity goes. Secondly, the aforementioned parallax effect is probably the biggest annoyance – being forced to slightly shrink your work area to avoid that isn’t the greatest solution ever. However, POSITIVES, and although I don’t believe this excuses its flaws, the price point is seriously impressive.
£350 for a remarkably competent tablet with a screen is certainly nothing to scoff at, and I think if you’re on a budget, particularly if you’re an amateur or a student, this is a nice low-cost entry into this type of product.
If you’re a professional, you may want to look elsewhere, but this is definitely the strongest offering I’ve seen as far as entry level goes, and I have no issues recommending it.
But for now, be sure to rate the video, or leave a comment if you own this and feel I missed something, or you just have your own two cents to add.
Alcatel Pixy 3 tablet
I found the memory
internal memory got filled up pretty quick nothing along the bottom and nothing on the side and just headphone and USB on the top so things kept nice and simple 2 megapixel camera on the back point three megapixel on the front at the time a review
this was running
Android 5.0.1 and it worked very well really nice and smooth worth noting that Alcatel have a habit of installing a lot of software on this out of the box
so you do get an awful lot of stuff that you might not be that interested in but in credit to them you can actually go and uninstall most of the stuff that you don't want if you don't use this saw the screen is really nice and clear and it's great for games so the touch screen controls here
your hands don't really get in the way of the action because the screen is nice and large and the 1.3 gigahertz processor is capable of playing some really advanced games really smoothly so here
Bluetooth some speakers and use this as a little screen so here I've got it hooked up to a pair of Edifier speakers really good and despite the reflection from the windows you can still see the screen nice and clearly the large screen means you can do a bit of web browsing and it's not too heavy to hold in one hand and just poke around with the screen with the other so overall this is a really good tablet
it's like my first
I mean I wouldn't throw it across the room to the TV but it is made with kids in mind and probably can take quite a beating the cord attaching the stylus to the device is nice and flexible but a bit short for me but in all honesty its length does keep it from getting tangled around something and being pulled out
Stacey's stylus eyes
and then there's the settings area when you starts for the tutorial will guide on roughly 35 minutes allowed purgin thirty minutes there are roughly 35 minutes allowed per image
are you kidding me
wait a second
I mean given that it's a very cool feature but I would have liked to have seen something where you could reduce the number of undos and increase the amount of time that you have drawing now albeit that it will be enough time for most people but I could see some artists really getting frustrated that the limitations and that's what they are limitations and with a program of this genre limitations are exactly what you do not need but for kids who like to draw quickly it won't be a hindrance
say what's that son
oh come on pop
that's my boy also
I mean sure
what drawing medium looks best at what times and the basic usage of the game tablet if you're going to make a sophisticated piece of kit for the Wii that's targeted towards younger players
it was for the D s a system with much less memory and processing power however after only about 20 minutes or so I got the hang of working with different mediums and really got the knack of working with the stylus showing a master painter using the program is all well and good but it means nothing
so if you use the button on the side of the stylus drawing is not really that hard you just press down on the button and move across the game tablet but if you want to utilize the heavy and light the thick and thin aspects of the program
it's a pressure button
and it's a very clever design allowing you to use the art program to allow you to press harder to make heavier lines and ease up to make lighter or thinner lines but the problem is that the button and the tip is very stiff and I had to push down kind of hard with the stylus and I also had to do it upright to make it work but I personally hold a pencil at an angle so this was kind of awkward as the tip doesn't work well at an angle and I fell into using the side
button of the stylus had the tip been less stiff than it would have been a dream to use but as it is you'll have to get used to using it straight up
I'm not left-handed and the tablet was made to be held so you can do quick changing of tools and resizing on-the-fly with your thumb and forefinger on the Wiimote but if you are left-handed which an estimated twenty to thirty percent of the u.s. is that's a huge demographic Barack Obama Michelangelo shigeru miyamoto link within your sol THQ left-handed tablets
get on it
and please remember
this might make for some interesting new deviantART pages it's a fun program and it's a sturdy peripheral but I just can't see many adults getting it unless they really want to draw
you would think that it would work well but since you have to draw by looking the television screen and not on the on the pad itself well it could be fairly difficult for beginners
it's got a sturdy design and was made to last the program is fast to learn and you can save your images to an SD card and put them on a computer later on of the negatives the program isn't as powerful as it could be
unless you're an artist
don't get this game
I'd love to see and secondary disc that's aimed for an advanced audience or even a disc that taught drawing there are many options for the peripheral and I would hate to see this game system fall to the wayside like the beatmania pee as to controller did here in the US so because of the sturdiness of the tablet and the surprisingly nice art program I rate this game and its peripheral a seven out of ten
it's just not for you if you aren't an artist but if you are it's a fun program and it would be interesting to see what you could do with it my phone
oh my oh
I'm sorry
what appeals to me the most about the knee pad 3 is premium build and software it measures in at just seven millimeters thick and consists of a unibody aluminum
I have with it
the question you're going to have to ask yourself before you decide to buy this thing is if you really need a tablet that is a couple inches larger than the display in your smartphone
I mean there will be a market for tablets with eight inch displays but given the lack of updates to the iPad Mini line it's evidenced at the market for such tablets is shrinking while the market for large smartphones is on the rise now
you get a lot of useful features like quick settings cogwheels that appear at the top of the notification panel and some other useful features but there is a big catch and my UI or me UI version
I admire I like how in the settings you can determine if you want to show notification icons your connection speed and Wi-Fi network you are connected to up talk in the notification panel
No smartphones is built into the settings here Xiaomi has made it easier to tweak the devices animations under battery and performance you can hide or show system animations this will speed up your device or slow it gadget hitting on the settings you select
mediatek processors equals 4
spit out a single core score of around 1600 and a multi-core score of around 4,000 the meet pad 3 has a 13 megapixel rear-facing camera sensor and a 5 megapixel front-facing sensor the rear sensor will likely not perform better than your smartphone
xiaomi says you'll be able to get up to 12 hours of battery life but I think that's a little bit of a stretch and will require you to be using the tablet at low brightness
there are dual stereo speakers on the rear of the tablets that do a decent job they don't get as loud as I would have liked and they don't quite compare to the speakers found on the newer iPad
it would have been nice to have them located on the front of the tablet so audio is blasted tour your face but these speakers are not terrible all in all the Xiaomi me pad 3 is a solid alternative to the iPad Mini for $300
is it's awkward sighs
I could see the tablet being great for a family or four young kids who are too young to have smartphones if you're interested in the Xiaomi me pad 3 I'll place a link in the description to check out the listing via gearbest.com
and if you're in the market for one of these a tablet this in particular is an iPad air so 399 bucks is the entry fee for one of those yes
it's a high-end tablet but what if you want many of the same features but this is all you got then you're going to want to look at one of these the Iconia 110 from Acer offers a lot of performance for a whole lot less money
Iconia 110 for okay
remember all these
I just actually still get these in the mail but the fact is there's nothing more convenient than grab a tablet on the go and have access not only to reading material but they have access to my email have access to videos
I really love tablets especially large tablets and I think that this tablet right here the Acer Iconia 10 does a great job for very little money when compared to the much more expensive tablets
here's the thing
so you know the starting price for an iPad air 2 is 399 16 gigabytes model which is not enough memory or you go to 500 bucks to get a 64 gig model you know
I'm getting 32
gigs for 149 bucks
yeah come you 110
that's important guys
let's do something funny
Iconia 110 is
social media email
reading is just fine
Android lollipop 5.1 pre-installed
you have two front facing speakers on the tablet right here so two front facing speakers a two megapixel front facing camera you also have we come around to the sides
the top of the unit you have a 3.5 inch headphone jack and then a micro USB connector for charging the unit all in all this seems to feel fairly well made the back has a kind of a textured surface to it so it doesn't feel real slick it feels really solid in the hands
it's not 1080p
it comes with 32
runs comes with
Park Blocks calm today
so that's the disclaimer
I've been using this for the past few weeks on my Mac and also on Windows so I'm going to talk about the performance of that on those two operating system
this is the one cable that is provided and this is the USB port where you can plug it into your computer so even though even if there's no battery left inside you can still use it
so you need to plug the cable into this part here right at the top and this USB port to your computer and you can charge it so far I have only charge it once the first time
they are preset
you can use it even if you are left-handed because you can change that in the settings so if you're left-handed the problem you will probably be drawing like this so this area the power switch will be at the bottom branch site and keyboard shortcuts will be at the upper right side
this has a very smooth surface with some texture on it more like a texture that is similar to what I see on the Wacom so this is the Wacom tablet you can see that the texture is somewhat the same at least from my finger
since this is a wireless tablet you need to connect it somehow to your computer wirelessly and it does so using a USB receiver that hidden behind this corner of the tablet it comes in a form of a USB thumb drive
I want to show you the drivers and what you can do with the driver before you install the Wii on drivers I highly recommend you uninstall all other tablet drivers especially if you are using Wacom tablets make sure you uninstall the Wacom drivers this is to prevent any driver conflicts after you install if we on drivers they will be located in the Applications folder inside this folder called Wii on driver after you open the tablet driver panel you can customize the buttons on the pen there are two buttons on the pen you can also customize the pressure sensitivity
just click on any of these buttons and you can assign a keyboard key to it you can also assign functions like control option command shift if you do not use the shortcuts on the tablet
let me open
I'm going to show you the drawing performance on the Windows OS again before you install the query on drivers make sure you uninstall all other tablet drivers and in this case here
so that's the driver conflict if you are going to be using it on a desktop and you're not going to have that problem because you don't have the ability to use the surface pen but if you are using it on a Windows tablet like this
that's why when
i have already customized the buttons on the tablet so now i can use the buttons to create a new file i can use the buttons to zoom in and zoom out
it works perfectly now
you can glance very softly on the tablet you get very thin lines and if you press hot you get the thicker lines let me zoom in to let you see how smooth that lines are so the lines are actually very smooth however
I stopped drawing here
and this is the start of the second line so I'm not going to zoom in to let you see the second line for the second line I did find
some jitter is not very obvious but it is definitely there and this is quite strange because the first line is perfectly smooth but the second line it has jitter and sometimes the jitter appears
I'm not sure whether that is because after driver the tablet or because of photoshop because when I switch over to the other drawing application that I use for example ms chief I can do the same thing but the lines are perfectly smooth as absolutely no jitter at all so here
a 30-day trial version that you can install and try now when you buy the free version you'll be able to draw the smooth lines without any problem and this is a very good software
have this issue with the line jitter so if you want to use this tablet with Photoshop you have to factor in the extra cost of getting the plugin that I recommended earlier called lazy
Nezumi Pro
Pro all those drawing software the pressure sensitivity works perfectly and there is no problem with line jitter so this could be just a Photoshop issue and if you are using it with Mac OS just have that is flawless
yeah thanks for watching
our product reviews you
top here
here's your 3.5
millimeter headphone jack
and under this door
Motorola there's no charge
this also has a plastic dummy in here because it needs a software update apparently to see the card not the end of the world for the moment though because this has 32 gigs of internal flash storage
here's the 7 inch
Froyo tablet
6 pounds for the 3G plus Wi-Fi model Motorola sells a couple accessories that go with this including there's a just a charging dock there's a charging plus HDMI dock and with built-in speakers a Bluetooth keyboard
it's not leather
it's a nylon a neoprene water-resistant thing and it's got plenty of padding for the screen here and that also works as a support as you'll see in a minute to stand it up then you've got this here at the openings to the camera speakers and all that stuff now let's take it inside it's a slide in case so to put it on you actually slide in this part right here hitting the volume controls biaxin on the side and you can use it obviously like a regular old case snap it in on the sides and close it up carry it around nice
it doesn't add bulk
it's pretty protective and water-resistant so here you can use it in one of two positions like that more upright or tilt it you even drop it down nearly flat or you can drop the case around and use it completely flat
and it works
that we showed you
that's not yet enabled
Fring 2 and you've got Wi-Fi 802 11 BGN still ban in 2.4 and 5 gigahertz Bluetooth a GPS and Verizon EVDO Rev a 3G with a free firmware upgrade to LTE 4G coming

Wi-Fi lock the screen orientation if you don't want a switching portrait landscape on you control the brightness right here turn notifications on and off and get to all settings well show you what settings looks like now much more modern and clean looking many Android 2.2 and 2.3 that we've seen on the phones same pretty much at least the same selection of items here that you can choose from application management accounts and sync privacy about the tablet
Google search Google Maps Google navigation Google Talk gmail email music player really cool will show you then cover flow with labels here tap on whatever you want and those are those stereo speakers which are reasonably loud but tend to distort when the volume is set pretty high volume controls on the side
Big Town
of course you have your gallery application as always and that really hasn't gotten much of a gussied up interface here and it's remembering a movie that I had been putting so I hit the back button so here we are in the main view of gallery
and we've gotten videos that we've shot with the camera and we've got movies that we've loaded here so if you tap on there you want to see more info
here that we know is fairly high quality and this is when you're looking at a channel view this is what you see also very nice actually much nicer than the desktop version of YouTube
ready yet
Google Books so here
there is no bookmarking however you can make the book available offline in there and will download it to the device for you and yes it works also in portrait look so obviously you just like the iPad
it supports pinch zooming
and you can
of course view this in portrait or landscape mode settings have moved here it's like Chrome you've got incognito tamp a private browsing you can get page info share the page search on the page and go to more settings so you can sync with Google Chrome over here

Angry Birds runs fine
Wi-Fi so though here we've got the article and you can scroll the text independently of the images that are on the side keep moving through and then the videos embedded directly in CNN know
you know your feeds you can select them them up and down and then you can go sideways inside of the feed and tap on that and there's the article really sweet in my reading and you can Facebook and Twitter with that as well hit back so a great use of the screen and very enjoyable way to look at the news especially if you are graphically oriented person now
it looks really cool so here you can scroll through current movies tap on it get information and you can play the trailer inside the application and the trailers tend to be mobile optimized
it loves with some popular applications that it picks up the scrolling right here so you can scroll through some recommend the apps graphically you can go to categories here on this side that Scrolls independently as well
and if you'd rather speak you've got the speech button over here and of course on the home page - you can search for anything using voice or of the search box for Google so it's neat to see this plane on the 10.1 inch display
for some reason
if you don't need a doc or anything like that to help do this you just do need the cable that's the Motorola Xoom it sells for $7.99 without a contract it does have Verizon 3G built in with a free upgrade to 4G whether you use it or not you do not have to pay any activation fees and you can get a month-to-month plan if you wish or you can sign a contract and get it for
$5.99 making it
one of the more expensive tablets on the market but it's a pretty nice proposition and it competes well with the iPad in terms of main 32 gigs of storage 3G by five a 10 inch display and some of the most cutting-edge hardware you're going to find on a tablet right now including the dual core
so yeah the company
it's this massive package and i am really excited to open it up and try it out so yeah all right so it's like a week later at this point but finally gonna unbox this box so yeah i got some scissors and we're just gonna go ahead and um cut this thing open
i assume so
we took off that really nice looking lid off a little broken here but it does not look like it affected anything inside so that's good and now let's see what we got inside so whoa
oh my god wait this is i think this is like a little i think anyway but i think i think this comes with a case so that you can um put the tablet in the case and bring it with you which is really nice
it is pretty big
um drawing tablet
oh let me see if i can put it in the case right now just to keep it safe while i see what else is in the box so we have the stand right here
all right
oh it
matte screen protector
this is really the biggest size i would go for in a drawing monitor and this really feels like the first step in creating a kind of professional animation workspace setup
this isn't any longer a little tablet that i can just connect into my laptop to get animating but a real addition to creating a desk workspace where you can create digital animations and art
that sounds good but that means you also have to have that setup where you can manage all the cores have the space for it and the ability to easily access all of your tools
there's only really one problem that i have identified with the tablet and it is that there's a bit of a tail at the end of some strokes while i'm drawing
so it's not really a big deal for the type of stuff i do but it's definitely something to keep in mind and i hope they fix it in a later driver update overall
i hope you're cool
i'm very cool because i've been sent a tablet to review for your dedication and it was actually perfect timing because i've got an ipad and i love my ipad but it was coming time to replace it
anyway i've got my phone and my computer for all my essentials and then my tablet my ipad at the moment is really just used for youtube lots and lots of youtube mainly youtube
nothing too hardcore
so when dragon touch got in touch with me and um sent this out for review i was like great timing because it's 99 bucks guys 99 so under 100 bucks sounds a lot more inviting than spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars for high specifications
you know i don't need my tablet to have an amazing high-res camera i don't you know because i've got a camera for that and i've got my phone and my computer and other things for that so i just needed to do simple tasks well and i did panic a bit when they sent it out to me
because i thought i'm not a technical wizard or tech guru in any guru in any way shape or form you know i couldn't tell a gigabyte from ram from quadrangle processing phalange like way over my head
we like you
they put no conditions on what i'm telling you so i thought that was really refreshing and i also thought that it gave a good impression about the company itself that uh they trust the product enough for me to give my honest verdict
i don't game and i'm not going to pretend to for this review so there won't be any gaming reviews but i do mention some of the online reviews so that that's covered and i've had the k10 notepad in my possession for a week now and i've been using it every day so i feel that i can give you my feedback first of all
i've saved this moment
it's quite handy
it's r i
v e r if you're wondering now speakers are somewhat compromised on a budget tablet so you can't expect the best quality and the sound from this tablet is tinny as you'll hear it is somewhat tinny but i did find that when i use headphones it brings back a lot of that lushness and i've seen reviews
it doesn't bother me
i quite like tinny
you'll see that took a little bit of getting used to because it's just not as responsive as some high-end models but i will say that after a couple of hours of using this probably less actually my muscle memory adjusted and the experience became a lot more second nature and less jarring as i learned
because you get used to a certain pressures on different devices don't you and once i learned i learned so the first few minutes as you can see felt a bit clumsy and a bit awkward and i sort of panicked but it is amazing how quickly our senses and reactions can adapt and respond and the keypad requires slightly firmer tap than i'm used to only minimally though and again no problems there at all you get used to it very quickly and when you're browsing the web pages lag by just those few microseconds longer when they're opening or when you're flipping between pages but you get used to it one just notices those extra milliseconds initially because once they're used to almost instant browsing now
when i watched the playback of this i was a bit worried that my fingerprints were creating some grubbiness on the screen but actually afterwards i compared it next to my ipad like for like and it was the same
it feels robust
so the dragon touch notepad k10 features 2 gigabytes of ram and a 64-bit quad-core processor offering the smooth performance of playing videos surfing the internet and running light games
so it's substantial
uh the rear camera
scratch your ass okay
you can easily connect your tablet into any tv and start streaming your favorite content with a five thousand milliamp hours battery and smart power saving technology dragon touch notepad k10 allows you to enjoy entertainment and gaming for over 10 hours
how long it lasts with gaming people say between five and ten hours but it depends what sort of games you're uploading and i don't play games and i'm not going to pretend that i do so i can't advise you on that
the amazon rating is four and a half stars out of over three thousand ratings which i think is actually pretty spectacular because amazon's a harsh place so go and take a look for yourself and make up your own mind um when it comes to powering down
that was extremely simple
there as you see just took a couple of seconds i did notice the power up here um took as long as it takes for me to drum my fingers here for a substantial amount of time so it wasn't the quickest startup
but if you're anything like me you're not going to be starting up several times of the day you'll just do it once in the morning and leave it on until the battery dies out and just leave it on stand by my mode the rest of the time so definitely not a deal breaker there and it looks quite pretty doesn't it
that sparkling away
come on ah bingo
hopefully so we can get an overview first one here first tab that we received was fully charged out of the box but after only playing on it for a couple of hours it died completely
i contacted amazon
customer service
customer service was excellent
okay so that's more in praise of amazon really but they've still given it a four out of five stars for the product and said the replacement's been no problem so hopefully that was just a bit of bad luck for the first one next one here recommended five stars more than pleased at what i got
i bought this one
very good verified purchase
she received it
in my opinion
it doesn't do me
the sound from them is very tinny a pair of headphones or bluetooth speakers are something i'd suggest overall looking at the tablet market seeing what's available at the prices tablet is it's worth getting in my opinion and i call it like i see it
i purchased this tablet based on many good reviews i read needed a basic tablet for email few apps however my complete review okay so he was reading an ebook and the screen went blank
explain the situation
nice tablet for watch
so can you see
i had a google chrome laptop and it's kind of like moving back a little bit in time to that it feels kind of dated because we're used to everything moving so quickly and doing what we need a little bit faster and this just takes it back
it's definitely not a deal breaker because it's so cheap i think if you're a similar kind of user to me and you just use it for light browsing watching things then it does those things perfectly well with a nice picture job done if you're a more demanding user and you need more capabilities
multiple windows open
you're a heavy gamer
something like that
don't buy this
they're not good
they're not good
everything looked very washed out and low res but in complete honesty i never ever use my tablet to take pictures really or to take any kind of meaningful camera work
i don't need it
i'd rather sacrifice some of the bells and whistles and a little bit of the speed for a much much lower price than pay hundreds and hundreds of dollars for those little extras just
so that's for you to make up your own mind but i was very happy to be sent this and i've been enjoying using it so i'll leave the links below for you guys
i'll leave one to the dragon touch website because they sell various products not just tablets so that might be interesting and also the amazon link that takes you straight to the product and also the reviews so that you can
also there's going to be an art programs giveaway at the end so be sure to watch and look out for that so many people have been asking me on how i animate first of all i barely animate
i personally use meriban paint but you can use whatever you want or whatever you prefer so of course before doing an animation you gotta prepare a storyboard for the whole animation itself
roughly yes i know
and once you're done with your storyboard you gotta sketch each layer or frame then line art and color and shade and you gotta do that for every single frame you did and honestly
i try to do line art color and some light shading because my sketches tend to look really messy after exporting your frames as a transparent png you have to import them to your editing program
it looks cute
it's very small
i guess a usb cable a lot of spare nibs a pen with two buttons the wireless usb thingy and two of these so it can be connected to your phone as well
i think it's a good starting tablet for beginners if you're just starting to delve into digital arts and if you want a really good quality tablet that you can really get into it's a really great tablet remember when you said medibang

Wacom splash one
there's a link in the description below if you want to get your own welcome splash one table and actually have given two of these away of my channel for free but yeah you can grab one via the affiliate link in description below if you're interested so let's take a look at what's inside the box when you purchase the
Wacom splash one tablet
CD drive you can download the drivers via the link in description below without the use of the CD which is pretty much what I did lastly the Wacom pen which again is very lightweight and it fits nicely into the hand
there isn't a whole lot of difference in feeling to that of drawing on paper and they've managed to make the crossover quite effortlessly so after you've installed the drivers with a CD of the download you can hook it up to your device which is pretty self-explanatory
I have a tutorial on how to set up brushes with things like hand lettering and illustrator which I will link at the end of this video if you want to check that out the once you've selected your brushes and have located the brush tool you can then start drawing the pad which will true into Adobe Illustrator as a better design and like I said the smoothness of the pen on the back of splash

hi today
I thought I would do a little review of this digital art pad that I purchased um I kind of wanted one with a screen for a while but then I realized that I have three screens so I thought I would save myself several hundred dollars and just get one that I've heard a lot of good things about this is the huion
oh it smells good
there's the pad itself
mmm it's beautiful cool
dad helico this
I guess I stopped working on it because it didn't at some point and I wanted to work on other things or whatever so yeah it's also kind of a simple drawing it's just two objects and lots of background so I figured it would be perfect to finish up and try scanning in and working on in Photoshop so working in Photoshop is one of the things that I wanted to get better at during this whole quarantine thing there's so much you can do in Photoshop and I don't know I guess I just kind of want to get better at doing digital stuff like expand my my options artistically
yeah there's there's just so much you can do and I'm sure as you watch this you'll notice I'm just trying to cut these things out and play with the background
a bit but yeah
I get so frustrated and OCD about zooming and zooming in on every single little pixel and trying to decide which one I want it's I don't know it drives me nuts and there's actually a point where I had to during the recording of this
I've since reformatted my computer I rather like erased the hard drive and just kind of not the hard drive but reinstalled Windows and things have sped up a bit
anyway this pad here
so um yeah this
Huey on tablets nice
it just works magically
it's fantastic granted
I get the hype
there's one other one
Groot Groot brushes
I did one other or I just like got a blank pad and tried every single brush and all these different colors and just made a huge mess and it was a ton of fun I think I spent like three hours playing with all those brushes but anyway yeah this pad rocks
I definitely recommend it if you're looking for something affordable um I think this was 50 ish dollars and uh yeah hope you guys are doing well staying safe all that good stuff and I'll see you next time
have a good week
welcome everyone
Ematic ewt 826 BK
I got this product off fries for $56 and I've seen it advertised for that price for quite some time so I'm wondering how it's going to perform well some of the specs here this does feature Windows 10
there is a micro
is the keyboard that I was really interested in and I'm gonna tell you why this product is kind of unique versus some of these others so it does have this keyboard but this is an actual keyboard dock
oh yes so
it actually has some sort of magnetic magnetic force going through and it's staying in place and it looks pretty sturdy actually so anyways because it has this power connector
Bluetooth keyboards you'll know what I'm talking about when you get frustrated realizing that you have to constantly keep the unit charged up and that's just another thing for you to worry about so that kind of alleviate the need for that let me go ahead and get this power it up see if it works so it's booting up and the boot up screen is in portrait mode so hopefully it will rotate automatically okay
I'm setting this up but it is in portrait mode so looks like I might have to undock for the time being just to get this set up okay now it has rotated the screen so maybe I can put it down onto the dock all right of course it is a touch screen so you can use it that way so the setup is taking a while I have to say so far
I have very good viewing angles for just by looking at it and it does seem to compare very favorably with other types of tablets so I really like the screen quality here
the system resources for a little while so 17 gigabytes does sound like a whole lot of space but in my experience you need to keep this storage area free because when
Windows does its updates
what's most of the
this will give you a indication as to how the performance of the unit is because Google Earth is a very demanding application and it will work best with 8 Mouse because tablet mode with Google
I'm going to try out the keyboard and show what it's like for you folks so I'm going to be using notepad and just using the built-in keyboard my impression is that the keys are pretty small there it could be bigger so I'm just having a hard time typing overall I mean it's very uncomfortable typing
the other thing is that there's this lip here on the keyboard and me not people to see it but it makes a little bit awkward too tight because you don't really have a place to rest your fingers or your palm and that kind of hinders the typing ability here and what
there's some of the keys also will not register it like for example here so if you can see here a pressing hole and it's not it's not always registering so it depends on the angle
it won't register the key there's an on-screen keyboard and the on-screen keyboard works pretty well and you can close that so of course that's gonna work well when you are when you got this separated
I would probably say 5 hours if you're very lightly using the unit now a problem is because this is a Windows unit it will periodically try to pull Windows updates and if it's pulling a Windows Update that's a fairly demanding task and that will just destroy your battery life completely and it's at 75 percent brightness
there is a camera on the unit both front and back and I'll have some test imagery up on the screen for you folks so you can take a look at the quality
don't expect stellar quality
remember folks
I got a YouTube
so there's no lag whatsoever on the video playback which is to be expected because of the hardware acceleration on it but this is where the inconsistency of the one gig ooh one gigabyte system comes into play because sometimes it'll run really really quickly
it's just gonna be really really slow in fact it's gonna feel like an eternity what I would say is if you are getting this tablet you want to use this for a specific purpose a specific program
I had my Audio Technica USB microphone attached to this OTG and it worked just fine and I had a hub attached to this OTG so you could run multiple USB devices at the same time and it was
it worked perfectly fine
I did have the purpose of running a single Windows application that I wanted to run on a device like this and it definitely fulfilled my needs what I uses as a general purpose tablet for everyday browsing and activities and things like that probably not
there's better options out there these days and it probably won't cost you a whole lot more either in fact there's can be some comparisons against the tablet out there for a similar price for example the most popular would be the Amazon Kindle 7-inch which sells for a little bit less
so that's cool
it has a manual a little cloth to clean the screen for when your oily fingers mess it all up a warranty thing which you could fill out or just five from the
looks like mini
here's the late
there's like a scroll
I have kind of problems with pain in my back when I draw on graphic tablets so having the screen upright really helped me keep a better posture while I drew
at a time
it feels really cool
I notice no matter how many times I try to fix the calibration it's slightly off and I feel like it's something I have to get used to since I've never reviewed any other screen tablets
it's also nice like I said because it's a second monitor so that means more monitor desktop spaces so I could put my other folders for art and stuff all organized on the second screen as for it
I can't scroll or zoom smoothly it's always super choppy so I just use all and then plus and minus to zoom which I think I think for like the quality of this that should work nice and smooth but it doesn't and that disappointed me just a little bit
it's very comfortable
it's a little bit different from my monitors color but my monitor is not the best so this is nice to have a true to color experience with this tablet
it's very crisp
I have to mention
is that the screen
that is okay with sacrificing the fact that it's not touchscreen just for like a first time getting used to screen tablets this tablets on the market for about four hundred and eighty dollars which is pretty cheap for a screen tablet especially in comparison to welcome screen tablets
so that it elevates it just a little bit more because I am very short and I don't want to stretch my neck any more than I have to another thing
Huyen gets pen tilt control only on the tablet pens because when you draw on a screen tablet it feels like traditional so you expect it to be like a traditional thing
it makes painting a lot easier and getting a lot of details and more easy so genuinely if you're trying to find a cheaper screen tablet to start out with because you know they can get really pricey
